FAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New Mexico (Mr. LUJA´ N) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise for the last time on the 
floor of the House of Representatives. 
Growing up on a small farm in New 
Mexico, I never imagined that I would 
walk these hallowed Halls and speak 
from this Chamber. Of course, I did not 
get here alone. I stand on the shoulders 
of giants like Dennis Cha´vez and 
Manuel Luja´n and many others who 
blazed a trail for me and other His-
panic Americans to serve our commu-
nities proudly in the people’s House. 
I also owe my public service to he-
roes a little closer to home: My moth-
er, Carmen, a retired public school em-
ployee; and my late father, Ben, a 
union iron worker who became Speaker 
of the New Mexico House of Represent-
atives. They taught me that no job is 
too big or too small, and that we must 
be guided by our compassion for others. 
It was their passion for serving others 
that propelled me to seek public office. 
Thanks, Mom and Dad. 
I also want to take this opportunity 
to express my gratitude to Speaker 
PELOSI, Majority Leader HOYER, and 
Whip CLYBURN
and countless other 
Members 
for 
their 
guidance 
and 
mentorship during my career in the 
House and during these last 2 years 
that I have served as Assistant Speak-
er. 
I want to thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for your friend-
ship and support. 
And thank you to the freshmen Mem-
bers, the new Members, who I had the 
honor of working with and mentoring 
during the 116th Congress. During a dif-
ficult time in our Nation’s history, 
your commitment to our constituents 
and the Nation has inspired me every 
day. 
Thank you to my staff, who work 
long hours and weekends to serve the 
people of New Mexico. Their support 
has enabled me to make progress on 
the issues that matter most to New 
Mexicans. 
And, finally, thank you to the people 
of New Mexico’s Third Congressional 
District. It has been such an honor to 
represent you. The House and I will 
never stop working to make a positive 
difference. 
I am proud of what we were able to 
accomplish for New Mexico’s Third 
Congressional District: 
Defending the Affordable Care Act, 
which expanded health coverage to 
270,000 New Mexicans; 
Reaching across the aisle to pass 
bills into law combating the opioid epi-
demic that has ravished families and 
communities; 
Working with my Republican col-
leagues to make robust investments in 
our world-class national labs; 
Creating good-paying jobs for New 
Mexicans by passing measures to bol-
ster our State’s growing outdoor econ-
omy and to improve broadband deploy-
ment in our rural communities; 
Passing legislation to preserve and 
protect Native languages for future 
generations; 
Ensuring New Mexico’s land grants 
and acequias are treated with dignity 
and respect, and can continue to 
thrive; 
And 
assisting 
thousands 
of 
New 
Mexicans in navigating our Federal 
agencies, helping veterans and seniors 
secure their hard-earned benefits, tax-
payers navigate the IRS, and new citi-
zens through the naturalization proc-
ess. 
Mr. Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD a list of 29 bills I led and 10 
that I co-led that became law while I 
served in the House. 
Come January, the Third District 
will have a new representative in Te-
resa Leger Fernandez. I know she will 
be a champion for working families and 
for New Mexico. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with her and the rest 
of my friends in the New Mexico dele-
gation from the other side of the Cap-
itol. 
I am truly humbled that the people 
of New Mexico have sent me to be their 
voice in the United States Senate. To 
be perfectly honest, it hasn’t sunk in 
yet. 
But I will miss the people’s House. It 
has been the privilege of my lifetime to 
serve here alongside you. Let’s con-
tinue to heed the call of the American

HONORING THE SERVICE OF BILL 
HUGHES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
wish my friend from New Mexico well 
in the next phase of his life. I thank 
him for his service to our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make a 
bittersweet announcement, and that is 
to say thank you to a member of my 
staff who has given 31 years of his life 
to this great institution. I am talking 
about Bill Hughes. 
Bill Hughes has decided to retire at 
the end of the 116th Congress. More 
than one person has remarked over the 
years that Bill Hughes comes with the 
building. Bill has been my policy direc-
tor since I became the Republican whip 
in 2014. He was my very first hire in 
that office. But his career was already 
legendary when I asked him to unretire 
and to join the whip team. 
Bill’s career embodies the American 
Dream. He grew up in South Dakota. 
He didn’t have connections in Wash-
ington. He just had a dream. He was 
drawn to public service, and his breaks 
came through hard work. He became an 
expert on the Federal budget and the 
legislative process. 
For 31 years, Bill has been part of 
some of the biggest policy debates, leg-
islative achievements, and history- 
making events of our time. He retires 
still doing what he dreamed about 
doing as a young kid growing up in 
rural South Dakota. 
Bill has served as policy director for 
a Speaker of this House. He served as 
staff director for a committee, as Chief 
of Staff for a Senator, and a staff direc-
tor for the Senate Republican Policy 
Committee. 
He began his career at OMB under 
David Stockman back in the Reagan 
administration. 
When I hired Bill, I hired the institu-
tional memory of this place dating all 
the way back to the 98th Congress. He 
has an encyclopedic memory of budget 
accounts, past appropriations battles, 
Senate procedures, and, yes, also the 
history of American music. You can 
imagine some of those conversations 
that we have had through some of the 
battles we have had up here. 
His colleagues respect and admire 
him; and more than one generation of 
staffers have sought his advice, guid-
ance, and mentorship. 
We have all been involved in drop-
ping a bill right over there on the 
House floor, but very few of us have 
dropped a bill the way that Bill Hughes 
has. 
One day, when he was working for 
the legendary Bud Shuster, Bill came 
running down to the floor with a 1,700- 
page infrastructure bill to get it intro-
duced so it could get voted on, and he 
literally dropped the bill on the floor. 
It took some time to put it back to-
gether and, of course, with Bill’s atten-
tion to detail, he made sure that every 
page was back in the right place. But 
he never once ‘‘dropped’’ a bill for me. 
Bill is a consummate staffer and a 
humble public servant. He works end-
less hours to ensure that I have the 
best information and the most impor-
tant facts about key legislation. He 
never made himself part of the story. 
He is that kind of person who deflects 
attention and credit. 
In doing so, Bill Hughes has earned 
the confidence, not only of me, but of 
all the leaders that he has worked 
with. Speaker Boehner, Speaker Ryan, 
Leader MCCARTHY
all have sought 
Bill’s advice and counsel during his 
tenure as my policy director in the 
whip office. 
I am sad to have to say good-bye to 
Bill. We will miss the House Repub-
licans’ ‘‘Senate whisperer,’’ as we refer 
to him. But very few have earned the 
thanks and best wishes that Bill leaves 
this institution with. 
Bill stands out among his peers and 
colleagues. He came to Washington 
nearly 40 years ago with a servant’s 
heart. He came here for a career in 
public service, and he leaves the House 
with more than 33 years of legislative 
and executive branch experience. It is 
truly a remarkable run. 
Bill is retiring to spend more time 
with his wife and kids and the greener 
pastures of his cabin in the mountains. 
If Bill wanted to continue to work, it 
would be right here in the House that 
he loves, and the House that will be 
forever indebted to his sacrifice, his 
wisdom, and his great love for the 
United States of America. 
Bill, we were lucky to work with you, 
and America is a richer Nation thanks 
to your service. You will be deeply 
missed here, but you have more than 
earned the opportunity to enjoy this 
next chapter in your already rich life. 
Thank you to Bill Hughes, and God 
bless you. 
f 
FAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise with honor to address this Cham-
ber one last time. And I say ‘‘with 
honor,’’ because it has been truly that 
to serve the people of South Carolina’s 
First Congressional District. I want to 
thank them for that opportunity, par-
ticularly because, by most accounts, I 
never should have been here in the first 
place. 
I was reminded of that over the 
Thanksgiving holiday as I walked on 
the beach on Sullivan’s Island with my 
2-year-old son, Boone. We were out 
there searching for a sandcastle that 
he had built the day before, but I knew 
it had been washed away by the tides. 
I thought about the slim chances I 
had of making it here back in 2018. And 
then my defeat 2 years later. It became 
apparent that political victories and 
losses are as transient and vulnerable 
as my son’s sandcastle on the beach. 
Especially in a district like ours, a 
Democrat in a ruby red and gerry-
mandered 
district 
that 
President 
Trump carried by 13 points back in 
2016, one that had not been served by a 
Democrat in my lifetime. 
But we made it here by promising 
something different, by promising to 
work with one another, reach across 
the aisle, listen to those we may not 
agree with, and get things done. 
Washington, D.C., was rife with par-
tisanship and chaos. However, I didn’t 
arrive 2 years ago to simply complain; 
I came to roll up my sleeves and be 
part of the solution. Or, as the old 
adage goes, I did not come to curse the 
darkness, but to light a candle. 
But it wasn’t just about talk; it was 
about action. We said we would work 
across the aisle, and I was ranked the 
fourth most bipartisan Member in Con-
gress. 
I said I would work with anyone to 
get things done, and President Trump 
signed two of my bills into law. 
I promised to protect our beautiful 
shorelines in South Carolina, and we 
passed my bipartisan bill that did ex-
actly that. 
We showed that working together 
can manifest remarkable results, all of 
which was made possible by the dedica-
tion of my incredible staff and with the 
love and support of my family. 
Sadly though, here in Washington, 
D.C., bipartisanship and civility seem 
to be the exception and not the rule. In 
my short tenure, I have been dis-
appointed with a lot that I have en-
countered. 
I have seen Members consistently put 
their party ahead of their own people; 
embracing conspiracy theories or argu-
ments detached from reality while 
knowing better and, sometimes, admit-
ting so privately. 
I have seen Members mock the Presi-
dent behind his back and praise him to 
his face; loathe him in private and wor-
ship him on television. 
I 
have 
seen 
them 
intentionally 
spread misinformation and lies, flirt 
with white supremacists, and pander to 
the most extreme voices in our society. 
And it has been for one reason and 
one reason alone: self-preservation; 
people more interested in protecting 
themselves and their party than pro-
tecting our country; more interested in 
keeping their job than doing their job. 
Such reckless and selfish behavior 
has created a system where most poli-
ticians can’t lose and most Americans 
can’t win. And when it is time to tack-
le the greatest challenges before us, 
our leaders cannot even agree on the 
problems, let alone the solutions. 
Today’s elected leaders bear a tre-
mendous 
responsibility 
to 
be 
the 
custodians of our young and fragile de-
mocracy. And make no mistake, our 
democracy 
has 
been 
battered 
and 
bruised, but it is not yet broken. And

to save it, we must agree on one basic 
truth: that the other side is not the 
enemy. The enemy is the stubbornness 
of our own biases. 
b 1215 
The enemy is a political system that 
seeks to divide us for sport. Let’s fight 
that and not each other. Our country is 
facing some serious issues right now, 
and our country will be much better 
served if Democrats and Republicans 
can come together. 
My grandfather always told me that 
you can get through about any problem 
if you actually sit down with somebody 
and have a beer together. I have been 
trying to work with people since the 
first day I got here. I won’t ever stop 
reaching across the aisle or trying to 
work with one another or sitting down 
and having a beer and listening to each 
other. 
For the betterment of this country, 
we have to come together. We have to 
sit down, listen to each other, and 
maybe even have a beer. 
In the spirit of bipartisanship and co-
operation, I raise this glass to my col-
leagues, both Democrats and Repub-
licans.

WARNINGS 
FROM 
BIPARTISAN 
COMMISSION ON FEDERAL ELEC-
TION REFORM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is my eighth speech in a series 
on voter fraud, election theft, and the 
Presidential election. 
There are three major flaws in Amer-
ica’s elections that socialist Democrats 
exploit to steal elections. 
First, voting by illegal aliens and 
other noncitizens is rampant because 
socialist Democrats made it illegal to 
require proof of citizenship when ille-
gal aliens and other noncitizens de-
mand to be registered to vote. In 2020, 
hundreds of thousands, and more likely 
millions, of illegal aliens and other 
noncitizens legally voted for Joe Biden 
after he promised them amnesty and 
citizenship if he is elected President. 
Second, vote-by-mail schemes are 
both horribly prone to voter fraud and 
are illegal because they violate Article 
I, Section 4 of the Constitution and 
Congress’ ensuing designation, with 
minor exceptions, of one 24-hour day as 
the election day during which citizens 
can vote. Yet, in 2020, socialist Demo-
crats foisted vote-by-mail schemes on 
America in order to more easily engage 
in voter fraud and election theft. 
Third, the lack of photo ID require-
ments makes it easier for paid socialist 
Democrat election thieves to steal 
elections with voter impersonators. 
While socialist Democrats and the fake 
news media repeatedly and falsely 
claim there was no voter fraud in 2020, 
what is most startling is this: America 
was warned 15 years ago that this 
would happen. 
In 2005, a bipartisan Commission on 
Federal Election Reform co-chaired by 
Democrat President Jimmy Carter and 
Reagan White House Chief of Staff 
James Baker issued a 105-page report 
specifically warning about the very 
same 
systemic 
flaws 
the 
socialist 
Democrats used in 2020 to steal elec-
tions. The commission report warns: 
‘‘Elections are the heart of democracy. 
If elections are defective, the entire 
democratic system is at risk.’’ 
Concerning noncitizen voting, the 
commission warned of a growing non-
citizen voting threat, citing 784 noncit-
izen votes in a contested California 
congressional race. The commission 
recommended that ‘‘all States should 
use their best efforts to obtain proof of 
citizenship before registering voters.’’ 
Of course, that means repealing the 
socialist Democrat law that makes it 
illegal for voter registrars to require 
proof of citizenship when illegal aliens 
and other noncitizens demand to be 
registered to vote. 
Concerning 
vote-by-mail 
schemes, 
the commission warned that vote by 
mail is ‘‘likely to increase the risks of 
fraud and of contested elections,’’ add-
ing that it remains ‘‘the largest source 
of potential voter fraud’’ because it is 
‘‘vulnerable to abuse in several ways. 
Blank ballots mailed to the wrong ad-
dress or to large residential buildings 
might get intercepted. . . . Vote buy-
ing schemes are far more difficult to 
detect when citizens vote by mail.’’ 
The commission recommended mini-
mizing voting by mail. 
On voter ID, the commission warned 
that the lack of photo ID opens the 
door to voter fraud and strongly rec-
ommended a photo ID requirement for 
voters, noting that ‘‘photo IDs cur-
rently are needed to board a plane, 
enter Federal buildings, and cash a 
check. Voting is equally important,’’ 
and that ‘‘voters in nearly 100 democ-
racies use a photo identification card 
without fear of infringement on their 
rights.’’ 
The commission recommended that 
‘‘citizens should identify themselves as 
the correct person on the registration 
list when they vote.’’ The problem ‘‘is 
not the magnitude of the fraud. In 
close or disputed elections, and there 
are many, a small amount of fraud 
could make the margin of difference.’’ 
How prophetic. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s republic is 
only as good as its election system. On 
January 6, 2021, I have a choice. I can 
ignore truth, surrender to socialism, 
and accept electoral college submis-
sions from States with election sys-
tems so badly flawed as to render their 
vote 
submissions 
unreliable, 
untrustworthy, and unworthy of ac-
ceptance. Or I can fight for America 
and move to reject them. 
I can’t speak for anyone else, but as 
for me, MO BROOKS from Alabama’s 
Fifth Congressional District, I choose 
to fight for America. 
HONORING VICKI WAGNER 
MANSFIELD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my friend and the ray 
of light that was Vicki Wagner Mans-
field, a resident of Troy, Michigan, who 
passed away last month after a 2-year 
battle with brain cancer. 
Vicki, simply put, was a pillar of our 
community, known and beloved by 
many. She was raised in Grosse Pointe, 
Michigan, and she moved to Troy with 
her husband, Bruce, in 1985 to raise 
their family. 
Her memory is carried forward by her 
beloved Bruce; her two amazing daugh-
ters, Abbey and Rachel; and her de-
lightful grandson, Hank. 
Vicki was known as a loving wife, 
mother, grandmother, daughter, sister, 
friend, and aunt. She is celebrated in 
our community for her artistic cre-
ativity, that forthrightness, her fierce 
loyalty, and the contributions that she 
made as an active volunteer in our 
community. 
Vicki was a mother’s mother. She 
was active in PTA, school events, and 
political activities, always with the 
goal of: How do I make this world a 
better place? 
So many former students through 
the Birmingham school system have 
stood up to say how much Vicki meant 
to them, how involved she was as a par-
ent with the Girl Scouts or in a play 
that she did. It was always because she 
cared about the outcomes of their 
lives. 
Vicki took the time in some of the 
remaining days that she had to mes-
sage me to say—not with a complaint 
or with a question—how much she 
cared about the work that we do in the 
Congress, to pass along to those who 
are in elected office a note of gratitude 
and thanks to say keep going, keep giv-
ing it all you can. 
That is certainly something that 
Vicki did every day of her life. 
Her passing is also a stark reminder 
of our work ahead to improve the re-
search and treatment of cancer in this 
country. Glioblastoma is a common 
and aggressive brain cancer with an 
unfortunately high mortality rate. A 
strong Federal investment is essential 
to improve our understanding and care 
of this tragic disease and for the pro-
viders like those at the Henry Ford 
Medical Center and what they rely on 
for good research. 
I carry Vicki’s light like a torch in 
the fight for increased funding for can-
cer research. As we inch toward this 
deadline to fund our government, I con-
tinue to urge and work with my col-
leagues to join me in supporting robust 
brain cancer research funding at the 
NIH and DOD to continue this life-
saving work. We cannot let those suf-
fering from brain cancer and their fam-
ilies fail.

CONGRATULATING 
GAIL 
LANGWORTHY ON HER RETIRE-
MENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and 
congratulate Gail Langworthy, an in-
credibly kind and dedicated employee 
of mine who has served my constitu-
ents for 8 years back in the district. 
Gail is moving on to an exciting new 
phase of her life, and she is leaving our 
office to enjoy her retirement. 
When Gail isn’t working hard for the 
people of Pennsylvania’s 15th Congres-
sional District, she is an active volun-
teer for the Breedtown Cemetery Asso-
ciation in Venango County. She enjoys 
dancing, visiting her three grand-
children in Florida, and exploring local 
trails while riding bikes with her hus-
band, Jeff. 
Gail has also been described as an 
avid thrift shop and yard sale junkie. 
Gail will be missed by our entire team, 
but I am happy for her as she begins 
this new adventure. 
Thank you, Gail, for your hard work, 
dedication, and service, and enjoy your 
retirement. 
RECOGNIZING DAVE BAILEY ON HIS RETIREMENT 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Dave Bailey, who has worked for 31 
years for the Office of the Chief Admin-
istrative Officer by supporting Member 
offices with all sorts of technology 
needs. 
Dave has been a frequent visitor to 
our office to help me and my staff with 
our computers any time that we had an 
issue. He also played a critical role in 
ensuring 
our 
office 
was 
ready 
to 
telework as we transitioned our lives 
online at the start of this pandemic. 
Simply put, we would not be able to 
do our jobs without people like Dave 
Bailey. 
I am disappointed that I will not be 
able to share my well wishes with Dave 
in person, but I wanted to take this op-
portunity to thank him for his three 
decades of service and for all the help 
that he has provided me in my office. 
Dave, be well, and enjoy your much- 
deserved retirement. 
COVID VACCINE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, this week, we reached a 
truly incredible milestone in the fight 
against coronavirus. 
On Monday, the first COVID–19 vac-
cine developed by Pfizer was adminis-
tered, and today, the FDA is meeting 
to approve the Moderna vaccine. 
The timeline of vaccine development 
was made possible by Operation Warp 
Speed, and it is truly a modern medical 
miracle. In the 1930s, at the University 
of Pittsburgh, Dr. Jonas Salk began 
work on a polio vaccine. It wasn’t until 
1953, 23 years later, that the vaccine 
was successfully tested. 
Operation Warp Speed has helped 
shrink the vaccine timeline and knock 
down barriers in delays. To develop a 
safe, effective vaccine in under a year 
is a testament to the incredible sci-
entific progress we have seen over the 
years and the refusal of scientists to 
surrender to this terrible virus. 
The marshaling of the public sector 
and the private sector together by 
President Trump has really resulted in 
this vaccine that we have all been des-
perately waiting on. The vaccine is a 
critical step in saving lives, saving 
jobs, and saving our economy. 
I thank President Trump for his lead-
ership in Operation Warp Speed, and I 
thank all the incredible scientists, doc-
tors, medical professionals, and the 
others who have helped make history.

COVID RELIEF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today, 
on the eve of a hopeful vote on the next 
COVID relief bill that our Problem 
Solvers Caucus has so ably led the 
charge on, I rise to tell the stories of 
three individuals from my district. 
Their stories represent just a fraction 
of the messages I have been receiving 
on COVID relief. 
But today, on the floor of the peo-
ple’s House, I rise because they deserve 
to be heard. Their stories are the rea-
son we refuse to go home for Christmas 
without an agreement. They are why 
we continue to fight until a deal is 
reached. 
First, I would like to talk about Bob, 
who wrote to me from Brighton, Michi-
gan. Bob is a pillar of his community. 
After serving his Nation in the Army 
National Guard for 6 years, he has been 
giving back to his fellow veterans for 
over 21 years as a district post com-
mander for The American Legion. 
But for the first time in 16 years, Bob 
recently found himself laid off from his 
job 
in 
construction 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus. To cover his expenses, 
like 171,000 others in Michigan, he had 
to file a first-time claim for unemploy-
ment insurance. Despite being eligible 
for the State’s maximum benefit, he 
cannot make ends meet. 
Between medications and health in-
surance, mortgage and car payments, 
utilities and food, he is having to turn 
to his savings, and he knows that won’t 
last long. 
Bob is responsible, a straight shoot-
er, and he has served our country. He is 
the kind of Michigander who anyone 
would want in their corner, but right 
now, he is asking for help, not some-
time in the future, not after the inau-
guration of a new President. 
He is asking us to pass a bill that 
helps the millions of Americans who 
are in need. It is our job, and it is our 
duty to rise to that call. 
b 1230 
I am also pushing for relief for Rich-
ard, who is from my hometown of 
Holly, Michigan. Richard chairs our 
Downtown 
Development 
Authority 
Board, which supports the businesses 
on Main Street, many of which have 
been devastated by the pandemic. 
Richard has had a front row seat to 
how critical the situation is, so he 
wrote me, asking what the Federal 
Government is going to do to save 
small businesses from bankruptcy. 
I had the chance to talk to Richard 
over the phone this week, and we 
agreed that small businesses need loans 
and clarity on whether those loans will 
be forgiven or if they can deduct that 
loan in tax season. This is what we will 
hopefully be voting on in the next 48 
hours in the update to the PPP pro-
gram. 
Richard and I do not see eye to eye 
on every issue, but when it comes to 
our local businesses, we are residents 
of Holly first. We agree that small 
businesses need a bridge to get them 
through the next year when the vac-
cine will be widely available. After all, 
it is business owners like Richard who 
have shown the grit and resilience 
needed to adapt to these challenging 
times. It is only right that we have 
their backs when they need it most. 
Mr. Speaker, lastly, I am pushing for 
this bill because of Karli. She is a serv-
er at Mackle’s in Hartland, Michigan— 
where, by the way, they have the best 
buffalo chicken wing tenders ever—and 
the best part of the job for her is cre-
ating memorable experiences for guests 
who come to share a meal. But these 
days, with the kitchen converted fully 
to takeout, she is working half as 
many shifts and taking home half the 
pay she used to. 
COVID blindsided her and the rest of 
the service industry, and now she is 
worried about the bills that are piling 
up. In between shifts and stretching 
every paycheck, she is going to school 
to become a nurse, joining the absolute 
front line of America’s latest war. Sim-
ply put, she can’t imagine going into 
the new year with no extra help. 
Mr. Speaker, she ends her letter with 
these words: ‘‘Please help take care of 
us so we can get back to taking care of 
you as our guests.’’ 
Take care of us so we can take care 
of you. 
Mr. Speaker, think about that for a 
moment. In the middle of a global pan-
demic, one that has claimed 300,000 
American lives and upended our way of 
life, that is the mantra of folks on the 
ground, folks who just want to take 
care of their neighbors and their com-
munities. They are not asking for the 
government to solve every problem, 
but they expect their government to 
act. 
For residents in my district, an 
agreement is more than just numbers 
on a page. It is a ray of hope that 
maybe they will spend Christmas a lit-
tle less worried. It is a new year that 
they can truly look forward to. It is a 
sign that, when their backs are up 
against the wall and they need help, 
Congress can get in a room and agree 
on a deal.

Mr. Speaker, we are so close to that 
finish line, and so I ask all my col-
leagues to join me in heeding the pleas 
of Bob and Richard and Karli. Let’s do 
the right thing. Let’s pass a bill so we 
can help those who need it the most.

RECOGNIZING PAMELA DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alaska (Mr. YOUNG) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my chief of staff, 
Pamela Day. Next month, after 25 
years of service—17 of them in my of-
fice—Pam will begin her well-earned 
retirement. 
Pam first arrived on Capitol Hill as a 
college student and served in my office 
with my friend, the late Representative 
Ben Gilman of New York. She first 
started in my office as a legislative as-
sistant, and her policy knowledge and 
genuine desire to serve my constitu-
ents quickly became apparent. 
Because of her hard work, determina-
tion, and positive attitude, Pam was 
promoted to legislative director, dep-
uty chief of staff, and, eventually, she 
became my chief of staff. Her leader-
ship in my office has been invaluable. 
It is no secret, as dean of the House, 
I have been here for a long time. As a 
Member of this institution for nearly 
20 years, Pam stuck with me through 
thick and thin, and I will always be 
grateful for her faithful service. 
She is well respected by everyone, 
from alumni of my staff and her col-
leagues on Capitol Hill, to leaders in 
the State of Alaska and advocates far 
and wide. You simply do not achieve 
this level of respect unless you set the 
gold standard for what a congressional 
staffer should be. Pam has gone above 
and beyond at every turn. 
Mr. Speaker, a chief of staff doesn’t 
just assist the Member; they have an 
entire team of employees who, at any 
given time, are working on countless 
issues. My staff would agree, Pam is 
admired, respected, and will be deeply 
missed. 
Pam’s tenure has seen many of the 
victories I am proud of. She served in 
my office while I served as chairman of 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure and passed our land-
mark highway bill, SAFETEA-LU. She 
also helped pass reauthorization of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery and Con-
servation Management Act. And her 
commitment 
to 
constituents 
has 
helped secure millions of dollars for or-
ganizations that serve Alaskans and 
Americans from all walks of life. 
Aside from legislative victories, Pam 
understood the importance of the rela-
tionships in Congress. She made sure 
that my office was always in good spir-
its. And as many will attest, she en-
sured that our annual office Christmas 
parties were the best on the Hill. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of Pam, 
and I am saddened to see her go. She 
served me, our State, and our Nation 
with 
professionalism, 
commitment, 
and a sincere love of country. She has 
always been committed to the next 
generation of congressional staff and 
has been a respected mentor to many 
of the staffers, both in my office and 
around Capitol Hill. Her leadership in 
my office was invaluable, and she will 
be missed by her colleagues as well as 
myself. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been my great 
honor to call her my chief of staff and 
an even greater honor to call her my 
friend. 
Pam, I wish you the best in your re-
tirement. You have certainly earned it. 
God bless you, Pam, and thank you for 
your service. 
f 
FAREWELL REMARKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on 
what has been the greatest honor of my 
life: the opportunity to represent my 
home State and Oklahoma’s Fifth Con-
gressional District here in the people’s 
House. 
This is not an honor that I take 
lightly, nor is it a responsibility that I 
could have carried alone. 
First and foremost, I begin by saying 
thank you. 
Thank you to my family, to my par-
ents, 
grandparents, 
great-grand-
parents, my friends, and all of those 
who have supported me throughout my 
life, who taught me the lessons about 
caring for our community, lessons 
about hard work and determination, 
about living the Golden Rule—the 
Oklahoma standard. 
Thank you to all my teachers and 
guiding voices who showed me, through 
words and actions, the value of service, 
the importance of showing up for each 
other and standing up for what is right. 
Thank you to Oklahomans who have 
shown up to make their voices heard. 
It is because of you we were able to ac-
complish everything we did. It is be-
cause of you that we were able to do 
what others said could not be done. 
Mr. Speaker, I express my gratitude 
for my staff, who worked day and night 
to serve the Fifth District: my legisla-
tive team who made sure that, with 
every vote I took, I did what was right 
for Oklahoma; my caseworkers, who 
were nothing short of lifesavers. Their 
work to help veterans and seniors, to 
help workers and small businesses and 
struggling families during this pan-
demic literally saved lives. 
Each and every one of my staff 
pushed themselves, not for my personal 
end, not to make a political point, but 
to serve a district and people that they 
care about, to help people who need it, 
and to make Oklahomans heard in Con-
gress. After all, that is why we are 
here. 
Members and staff alike, we are here 
to serve, and public service means put-
ting the best interest of others before 
ourselves. Service means listening to 
and working with others, even when we 
disagree. 
Service is not about winning at all 
costs. It is not about us versus them. It 
is about all of us working together. 
Service means leaving the world and 
our country a better place than we 
found it. 
I still believe that we can do that, 
that we must do that, that we must 
leave this country better than we 
found it. And, no, it is not easy. It 
takes work, but it is worth it. 
Mr. Speaker, during the 116th Con-
gress, I held 54 townhalls, a record for 
Oklahoma’s Fifth District. I met with 
thousand of Oklahomans: individuals, 
businesses, and organizations. It was 
worth it because connecting with con-
stituents and making sure their voices 
are heard is a critical part of this job. 
One of the most frequent questions I 
had heard time and again—one that 
broke my heart—was when people 
would ask me if it was even worth it to 
work across the aisle to try to get 
things done, whether it was even pos-
sible to find compromise and common 
ground in today’s bitter political cli-
mate. My answer was the same every 
time: Absolutely. 
We can and we must. We have done it 
before. Compromise takes hard work 
because it is always easier to walk 
away from the table, to point fingers, 
than it is to find a path forward. But 
finding common ground is worth it 
every time because, when we talk 
about service and working on behalf of 
our districts, to me, the best service we 
can provide here in Congress is putting 
politics aside and getting the work 
done for the people we represent. It is 
with hard work and commitment to 
talking to each other that we can do 
that, and we have proven it over and 
over again here in the 116th Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that, 
in this Congress, that is what I have 
done. I have had 25 bipartisan bills 
signed into law in the midst of a di-
vided government, those that make a 
real difference for our country and the 
people of Oklahoma’s Fifth District, 
legislation like my Military Tenant’s 
Bill of Rights and the Military HOMES 
Act, 
which 
work 
to 
address 
sub-
standard and unsafe housing on our 
military bases; bills like the PPP 
Flexibility Act, which extends finan-
cial support to small businesses during 
this pandemic; and legislation like the 
USMCA trade deal and the CARES Act, 
which all needed bipartisan support to 
pass. 
These things made a difference. They 
were accomplished because we worked 
together. We were able to get them 
signed into law. We have accomplished 
real things over the past 2 years in 
service to our country, but only by 
working together. 
And there is so much more left to be 
done. We have work to do to deliver 
quality, affordable healthcare to all 
Americans. We have to strengthen our 
public education system. We have to

work to create economic opportunity 
for all. And we must face the realities 
of inequity and injustice and systemic 
racism, and the work that has yet to be 
done to build a stronger America. 
There are no easy answers to these 
challenges. Simply put, there is no sil-
ver bullet or hashtag that will solve 
these deep-seated issues, but there is a 
right way to work towards a solution: 
by working together. 
Mr. Speaker, at this moment of fear 
and division, we have a choice: to re-
treat into our corners and find our-
selves pitted against each other, to fall 
further into this well of darkness, or to 
come together and find a pathway back 
to civility, to remember that our 
neighbors’ fears and struggles and chal-
lenges are not that different from our 
own. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a choice each of 
us must make, and we must urge our 
Nation’s leaders to make the choice 
correctly. We need leaders who will 
solve problems rather than create 
them, who will remind us of what we 
can accomplish together when we try. 
At this moment in time, we need lead-
ers who will renew our commitment to 
unity and public service because there 
is so much at stake. 
Mr. Speaker, we have more in com-
mon than we have that is different. We 
have more that unites us than divides 
us. And to make this great experiment 
that is our Nation work, we must rec-
ognize a fundamental truth: 
We are a government of the people, 
and that means we have to work for ev-
eryone. We are a government by the 
people—not by a party, not by two sep-
arate peoples, by the people. 
Mr. Speaker, to move ourselves for-
ward for the people, to keep our democ-
racy strong, we must recognize the hu-
manity in each other. Our Nation’s fu-
ture hangs in the balance. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE ABRAHAM 
ACCORDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
as this year draws to a close, I rise to 
commemorate the historic Abraham 
Accords. 
After years of foreign policy experts 
saying it could not be done, President 
Trump and his team have now brokered 
peace between Israel and the Kingdom 
of Morocco, the fourth such agreement 
in just 4 months. 
Because of these remarkable diplo-
matic accomplishments, we will seek 
continued cultural, diplomatic, and 
economic visits and exchanges between 
Israel and Bahrain, Israel and the 
Emirates, Israel and Sudan, and, now, 
Israel and Morocco. 
I believe that this represents a his-
toric paradigm shift in the region and 
gives momentum to ultimate peace be-
tween Israel and the Palestinians. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been more than 
20 years since Israel signed peace with 
the Kingdom of Jordan and more than 
40 years since the historic Camp David 
Accords and peace between Egypt and 
Israel. 
Since those historic agreements, the 
United States’ efforts to further peace 
in the Middle East have stumbled and 
faltered, with little to no significant 
progress shown. In fact, the situation 
for Israelis has been more dangerous in 
recent years, with terrorist attacks 
and rocket bombardments becoming a 
near regular occurrence. 
Expanding diplomatic relations be-
tween Israel and these other nations 
will be beneficial to pushing back 
against the Iranian mullahs, Hezbollah, 
and other extremists in the region. 
I look forward to the United States 
working together with Israel and these 
new partners at the table to solve the 
crisis in Syria and to counter the 
mullahs in Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, many of us in Congress 
encourage the incoming Biden adminis-
tration to build on these historic posi-
tive developments and not fall back 
into the failed Middle East policies of 
the past.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS ALBERT PARRIS 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a great 
American, Thomas Albert Parris. He 
was 87 years old. 
After joining the Air Force in 1948, at 
age 14, Mr. Parris was stationed in Ger-
many for 2 years, where he drove an 
ambulance and became a medic. Mr. 
Parris continued to serve in that ca-
pacity at various Air Force bases in 
the U.S. and abroad. 
While stationed in the Azores, Mr. 
Parris assisted in delivering 395 babies. 
After retiring from military service, 
Mr. Parris owned several gas stations, 
worked on nuclear submarines, became 
a private pilot, and trained racehorses. 
Most recently, he was recognized by 
the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and 
awarded the Cherokee Warrior Medal 
of Patriotism by Chief Chuck Hoskin, 
Jr., and the Tribal council members. 
I join Arkansans, Oklahomans, and 
all Americans in recognizing Mr. Par-
ris’ years of service and honoring his 
remarkable life. I pray he rests in 
peace. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NICOLE 
INMAN 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise to recognize Nicole Inman 
and her great memory, who, over the 
past many months, was recognized by 
her friends, family, and colleagues as a 
warrior of hope. Nicole recently lost 
her courageous battle with cancer. 
Many across Arkansas are mourning 
her passing. 
Nicole was the Bryant High School 
girls’ soccer coach, who led the pro-
gram to its second Class 6A state 
championship in May 2019, the same 
year she was awarded Coach of the 
Year by the United Soccer Coaches. 
She was more than a coach and a 
teacher; she was an inspiration on and 
off the field. 
Nicole’s faith was a cornerstone 
throughout her fight. With her strong 
faith in God, she used her illness as an 
opportunity to minister and inspire her 
players and students. 
Nicole was also an incredible wife 
and mother. Her legacy will live on 
through her team and her husband, 
Scott, and their four children: Garrett, 
Ashton, Abbey, and Nathan. 
She will be missed by her commu-
nity. I offer prayers for comfort to her 
family and condolences. Thank you for 
sharing her with our community. 
f 
CELEBRATING ATLANTA-BASED 
BUSINESSES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate several businesses and 
issues essential to Georgia’s Fifth Con-
gressional 
District 
and 
to 
greater 
metro Atlanta. 
As many in this Chamber likely 
know, 
my 
district 
is 
home 
to 
Hartsfield-Jackson 
Atlanta 
Inter-
national Airport. As many also know, 
the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged 
air travel, an industry critical to my 
district. 
Which is why this morning I am 
proud to celebrate Delta Airlines and 
Hartsfield-Jackson for the inaugural 
quarantine-free, 
COVID-free 
flight 
from Atlanta to Rome, Italy. 
As former chair of the international 
committee in the Atlanta City Council, 
I challenge the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee to facilitate measures that 
encourage more of this. 
My responsibilities attendant to the 
Fifth Congressional District prevented 
me from joining this group on this del-
egation, but I hope to be on later 
flights. 
I also rise to raise attention to the 
need for renewed support of the former 
OPIC-like activities via the DFC, the 
Development Finance Corporation. At-
tention to developing nations in Africa, 
like Nigeria, Ghana, and Ethiopia; the 
Caribbean; South and Latin American 
countries, such as Brazil and Colombia; 
Central Asia and Asia are in need of 
support. 
This morning, I also want to cele-
brate Home Depot, the world’s largest 
home improvement store, with more 
than 2,200 stores, employing 400,000 in-
dividuals. Under the vision of Arthur 
Blank, the Home Depot supports count-
less lives and families and continues 
their unwavering support of veterans. 
We know that the COVID pandemic 
has affected many industries, including 
home improvement. Many employees 
in industries all across the country 
have been deeply affected by the eco-
nomic toll caused by the pandemic, 
which is why the stimulus discussions 
occurring in the Capitol, if reports are 
to be believed, are still somewhat in-
sufficient. We simply cannot be con-
tent with $600 payments. $600 per per-
son is not enough. Frankly, my flights

here are about $300. So I am sure we 
can do better. 
Mr. Speaker, as we enter the holiday 
season, I also want to spotlight other 
Atlanta organizations for their support 
of those in need. I want to celebrate 
Tyler Perry Studios for telling uplift-
ing and inspiring stories and using 
their state-of-the-art facilities to sup-
port 5,000 families with food this past 
Thanksgiving. 
I also want to acknowledge two non-
profit organizations—Caring for Others 
and Hosea Feed the Hungry—that are 
both helping to fill the gaps during this 
pandemic. 
We, in Congress, also need to do our 
part. As I stated earlier, we can do bet-
ter than the $600 being discussed in this 
stimulus proposal. It is a good start, 
but it is not enough. 
There are other Atlanta-based com-
panies that are doing notable work 
that merit recognition: UPS, which has 
been critical in the disbursement of the 
COVID vaccine; and other companies, 
like Global Payments and Equifax. 
Later this week, I also plan to intro-
duce legislation to advocate for the 
continuation of the John Lewis Loop 
and Campbellton Road. Also in need of 
inclusion is Old National Highway, 
Fulton Industrial Boulevard, Candler 
Road, Camp Creek, and Martin Luther 
King Drive. They all need relief now. 
They are critical to job creation in our 
community and need investment.

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE 
PARTY FOR ALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, 
on 
December 
4, 
Speaker 
PELOSI and Congressman CLYBURN an-
nounced the unveiling of a new exhibit 
in the Capitol that pays tribute to Jo-
seph Rainey, the first Black Member of 
the House of Representatives. 
He served from 1869 until 1879. He was 
the first African American to preside 
over the House, and he was the longest- 
serving Black lawmaker in Congress 
during Reconstruction. In fact, he was 
a founding member of the South Caro-
lina Republican Party. 
Two other Republicans, George White 
and Jefferson Long, made history as 
the first Black Members of Congress 
from North Carolina and Georgia dur-
ing the same period. George White, 
from North Carolina, was a staunch ad-
vocate for other Black Republicans in 
the State and often took Democrats to 
task for not accepting the values that 
other Black Republicans held as well. 
Their stories deserve due recognition, 
and they also serve as reminders that 
political affiliations of any type are 
based on the values that one espouses, 
not just the color of one’s skin or sex. 
It is unfortunate that more Black 
Republicans are not elected to the 
House of Representatives or to the Sen-
ate. That is because Black Republicans 
have been attacked repeatedly by the 
Democratic Party and their friends in 
the mainstream media. 
Mr. Speaker, even now, Democrats 
are still peddling a facade of being the 
party of the people. However, their out-
right rejection of those who hold dif-
ferent beliefs just goes to show how 
contradictory the party truly is. 
Meanwhile, the Republican Party 
welcomes members from all different 
backgrounds. Just look at the diverse 
new Republican representatives that 
the American people elected to Con-
gress: women, veterans, and minorities. 
Those are the Republican candidates 
from across the country who have 
proven that Republican values are not 
the values of a few; they are the values 
of many. 
If we look at the centennial of the 
19th Amendment that happened this 
year, we see the same disinformation 
tactics at play. Democrats harp inces-
santly about how they were the ones 
that fought for the 19th Amendment, 
but history tells a different story. On 
May 21, 1919, 200 Republicans voted for 
the 19th Amendment in the House, 
while many Democrats objected. 
Mr. Speaker, facts can’t be forsaken 
as we look back at these historic 
events. However, flip through the pages 
of any classroom textbook and you do 
not see the Republican Party getting 
the credit it deserves for fighting for 
equality, women, and minority popu-
lations. 
Americans are not consigned to one 
set of political ideologies based on im-
mutable characteristics. Free societies 
are built by an open exchange of ideas, 
and that exchange must be respected. 
The American people do not need to 
be told how to feel, how to think, and 
what values they should support. That 
is irresponsible. The American people 
are perfectly capable of coming to 
their own conclusions, but they need 
the facts presented to them. 
The Republican Party is the party of 
equality, and the facts clearly show 
that. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LOCAL HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, over the 
last 10 months, the COVID–19 pandemic 
has had a devastating impact on our 
communities: from our frontline heroes 
working around the clock to families 
who have gone hungry, to the millions 
who 
have 
lost 
their 
jobs, 
and, 
heartbreakingly, the over 300,000 who 
have lost their lives. 
While many of us believe that the 
Federal Government can and still 
should do much more to alleviate the 
impact of the pandemic, we all can be 
inspired by the compassion, innova-
tion, and resilience of the people in our 
communities who have stepped up to 
serve and to try to fill the needs laid 
bare by this crisis. They are our local 
heroes. 
A few weeks ago, my office launched 
a local heroes initiative to showcase 
the countless people in Pennsylvania’s 
Fifth Congressional District who have 
gone above and beyond to help those in 
need throughout this crisis. In just the 
first few days, we received over 100 sub-
missions, and it has grown since then. 
From nurses on our front lines to 
children organizing food drives, we 
were overwhelmed by the stories of re-
silience, ingenuity, and absolute deter-
mination by members of our commu-
nity whose stories we don’t hear 
enough. So, today, I want to share a 
few of their stories. 
I am talking about people like Ni-
cole, an emergency manager, who is 
now serving our community by running 
two emergency rooms due to the over-
whelming number of COVID–19 cases. 
Aunt Nee Nee, as she is known to her 
beloved nieces and nephews, has only 
been able to see her family for limited 
amounts of time, if at all, since the 
pandemic started. 
People like Jillian, a mom of three, 
who regularly works 15-hour shifts in 
the ER, then comes home, disposes of 
her scrubs in a bin so she can hug her 
kids and help them do their school-
work. She is a real-life superhero. 
Young people like Emily, just 14 
years old, who, when she realized that 
some children in our community would 
be without holiday gifts this year, or-
ganized a toy drive, contributing her 
babysitting money and recruiting her 
younger brother and sisters to help 
make cards and wrap the gifts. 
People like Michelle, a nonprofit 
leader, who has ensured that our 
LGBTQ communities are not left be-
hind during this crisis; working to se-
cure housing, food, and medications for 
immunocompromised 
community 
members. 
Teachers like Jimmy, from Upper 
Darby, who knows how hard this tran-
sition has been for both students and 
teachers. So he has gone above and be-
yond to share acts of kindness, like 
dropping off doughnuts for his fellow 
teachers or helping students get help 
to obtain the technology they need for 
virtual learning. 
People like Ala Stanford and the 
Black Doctors COVID–19 Consortium, 
who organized free COVID testing for 
our most at-risk communities when it 
became apparent that they could not 
otherwise obtain testing. 
County 
employees, 
like 
Ed 
and 
Gayle, who have reinvented and orga-
nized dozens of drive-thru food drives 
to help feed our neighbors and keep the 
donors safe. 
These local heroes should inspire all 
of us, no matter what our party, to 
fight for more relief that the American 
people deserve. 
Every day we delay getting relief to 
them means more businesses go under, 
people get sicker, more Americans die, 
and families are stretched even thinner 
financially. We have got to get this 
done. The American people cannot 
wait.

December 17, 2020 
THANKS TO THE STAFF OF GEOR-
GIA’S SEVENTH CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank the men and women 
that I have had the pleasure of working 
with over these 10 years in Congress. 
When you announce that you are re-
tiring, folks need to start looking for 
that next opportunity. So the people 
who stick it out with you are a special 
breed. So, too, are those men and 
women who come and join you, know-
ing that their service will be short. 
Mr. Speaker, there are three such 
people: Sean Lerner, Emily Macdonald, 
and Tomas Rodriguez. Knowing I was 
going to retire, they came and joined 
the fight to serve the men and women 
of the Seventh District of Georgia and 
have done an amazing job for me over 
the past year. 
Catherine 
Morvis, 
a 
name 
long 
known 
in 
Georgia 
circles, 
having 
served with Congressman Phil Gingrey, 
came back to the Hill to help keep 
things together for me and move us 
across the finish line. She is still serv-
ing even today. 
Mr. Speaker, I have longtime staff-
ers—Lauren 
Williams, 
Nicholas 
Scoufaras, Vesna Kurspahic, Naomi 
Pillsbury—men and women who have 
been doing extraordinary work, always 
under difficult circumstances, recently 
under 
incredibly 
difficult 
cir-
cumstances. 
Mr. Speaker, I have got staffers who 
have been with me a decade or more, 
who 
have 
recently 
departed: 
Alex 
Poirot, Kelley Kurtz, Janet Rossi, and 
Elena Gabrysh. 
Elena and I started working together 
in 1999, serving the people of Georgia. 
Now, more than 20 years later, she has 
gone into retirement, having served lit-
erally thousands of constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to call particular 
attention to two public servants that I 
have been incredibly honored to be able 
to know in my life: My State director, 
Debra Poirot; and my chief of staff, 
Derick Corbett. 
Mr. Speaker, if you have not had an 
opportunity to meet Debra Poirot, she 
brightens up every room that she 
walks into with a genuine love for this 
country and a love for her community. 
She lives in Forsyth County, though 
she grew up as an Air Force child, calls 
Texas home from that time, but has 
claimed Georgia. 
b 1300 
So committed is she, Mr. Speaker, I 
remember a World War II veteran, a 
widow, and she was losing her housing. 
Debra woke up on a Saturday morning 
and read about it in the newspaper. She 
spent the next week finding this family 
and spent the week after that solving 
that problem. 
She made a difference in that life 
that can never be measured and did it 
not because a constituent called, not 
because someone knocked on the door, 
but simply because she lives a life of 
looking for opportunities to make 
other people’s lives better. 
She finds herself out in the commu-
nity each and every day, not just serv-
ing us but fulfilling a true heartfelt 
mission to see what she can do that 
others could not. An amazing woman, 
an amazing mother, and certainly an 
amazing public servant, and I thank 
her for that. 
Derick Corbett, Mr. Speaker, I had 
the pleasure of hiring him back in the 
year 2000. I didn’t think he was going 
to amount to much at that time, but 
we needed somebody on the bottom 
rung of the ladder and he agreed to 
raise his hand and do it. 
He could not be more of a rock, a 
rock for our office, a rock for our com-
munity. The common refrain I find 
when I go out into the district is: ‘‘Hi, 
Rob, 
good 
to 
see 
you. 
Where 
is 
Derick?’’ because he has such an im-
pact on folks. 
He won’t take ‘‘no’’ for an answer 
when a Federal agency won’t serve a 
constituent. He demands the service 
that each and every citizen knows that 
they deserve. 
He is an even better husband and an 
even better father than he is a public 
servant. 
But, Mr. Speaker, there would be no 
Congressman ROB
WOODALL
if there 
were not a Chief of Staff Derick 
Corbett, if there were not a District Di-
rector Debra Poirot. These two have 
changed countless lives, and among 
them has been mine. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of 
my staff for the amazing work they 
have done over the years. They are 
great Americans. They love this coun-
try, and I love them. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ROSIE LEE ATCHISON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, to live to become 109 years 
old in this country, or any country, as 
a matter of fact, is quite a feat. Such 
has been the life and legacy of Mrs. 
Rosie Atchison, who was born on Au-
gust 15, 1911, in Bolivar, Mississippi, 
and passed away on November 23, 2020. 
Her birth mother passed away when 
Rosie was just 6 weeks old. She was 
taken into the care of her father, Mr. 
Henry Liner, who raised her as the sec-
ond oldest of 27 children whom he fa-
thered. 
Rosie grew up in Clarksdale, Mis-
sissippi, where she lived a typical life 
of Blacks in that area. She worked the 
fields, went to church, got married, had 
two children, lost a child, got tired of 
the fields and a failed marriage, and 
took her two children and migrated to 
Chicago, looking for a better life. That 
is exactly what she found. 
With faith in God, she joined the 
Greater 
Salem 
Missionary 
Baptist 
Church, where the renowned gospel 
singer Mahalia Jackson was a member, 
and she also sang in the choir. 
She met and married her second hus-
band, 
Mr. 
Andrew 
Atchison, 
who 
worked for the Diamond Glue Factory. 
She found a job cleaning railcars for 
the Pennsylvania Railroad and worked 
there until her retirement in 1970. 
Mrs. Atchison and her husband be-
came very productive citizens and de-
veloped a reputation for helping others 
less fortunate than themselves. She be-
came known to many as Big Mama, not 
because of her stature, but because she 
embraced any and everyone who needed 
help that she could help. 
She and her husband lived in the 
heart of the Bronzeville community 
until they were forced out to make 
room for the Illinois Institute of Tech-
nology. 
They 
protested 
and 
held 
marches around city hall but lost. 
After her husband died, she pur-
chased a two-flat building in the Engle-
wood community and kept on helping 
people. 
On November 23, 2020, after 109 years 
and 3 months, Rosie passed away, leav-
ing 2 daughters; 15 grandchildren; 60 
great-grandchildren; 
95 
great-great- 
grandchildren; 
24 
great-great-great- 
grandchildren; 1 sister, Ms. Josephine 
Liner Wilson; and a host of nieces, 
nephews, cousins, friends, and extended 
family. 
What a life and what a legacy. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO LEE RAYBON 
Mr. Speaker, I also pay tribute to Mr. 
Lee Raybon, a pioneer West Side of 
Chicago business and community lead-
er. 
Whereas the Almighty God has called 
to his eternal rest Mr. LEE Raybon, a 
skilled mechanic and business leader 
who became a legend on the West Side 
of Chicago in the automobile repair 
business, 
and 
whereas 
I 
met 
Mr. 
Raybon in the late 1960s when one of 
my staffers, Ms. Arlene Granderson, in-
troduced me to Mr. Nate Irwin, who 
was her mechanic and working at 
Raybon’s Automotive Repair shop, Mr. 
Irwin became my friend and my me-
chanic. 
I had a reputation in my community 
for keeping cars a long time. I drove 
one car for 19 years, and everybody in 
the neighborhood knew the car. Mr. 
Raybon and his mechanics kept my 
cars running for more than 50 years. 
Whatever it was that I drove, they had 
it running. 
Ultimately, he and his colleagues de-
veloped 
a 
little 
group 
of 
businesspeople: Garfield Major; Willie 
Barney; the Knox family at the hard-
ware store; Cliff Duwel White at the 
fish market; Walker Harris, the ice-
man; Dave at the hotdog stand; and 
Reverend Murphy at the Rose of Shar-
on Cleaners. They were the heart of the 
business support group in that area. 
After he no longer worked, Mr. 
Raybon would come to the shop, sit 
around, and give people advice. He 
loved his community. He loved his 
business. He loved what he did.

I will never find another mechanic who 
can keep my cars running for 50 years.

DEFENDING COMMUNITY 
PHARMACIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of 
community pharmacies not only in my 
district, the Sixth District of Ten-
nessee, but across the country. 
Late last week, I received this letter, 
notifying me that my community phar-
macy would no longer be in-network 
and that if I had any future prescrip-
tions filled at this pharmacy, I would 
have to pay personally in full. This 
change would take place almost imme-
diately. 
Like most Americans, I have a years- 
long relationship with my community 
pharmacy, Gordonsville Drugs, and my 
community pharmacist, Amy Dudney. 
But I was not part of a select few in-
dividuals to receive this notification; 
there have been approximately 60 inde-
pendent pharmacies throughout Ten-
nessee that recently found themselves 
out-of-network for certain plans ad-
ministered by the pharmacy benefit 
manager, CVS Caremark. 
This is not happening just in Gor-
donsville, Tennessee. Many Americans 
have a community pharmacy like Gor-
donsville Drugs and a pharmacist like 
Amy Dudney in their community. 
Thankfully, due to sustained lob-
bying efforts by the independent phar-
macy community, CVS Caremark has 
reached out to many of these phar-
macies and offered them contracts to 
remain in-network. 
However, letters like the one I re-
ceived remain extremely damaging to 
our independent pharmacies. In the 
specific case of Gordonsville Drugs, al-
though CVS Caremark made the right 
choice to keep the independent phar-
macy in-network, they have yet to 
send a letter with this updated change 
to customers like me. CVS Caremark 
must commit to sending new letters, 
notifying customers that they can con-
tinue to use their neighborhood inde-
pendent pharmacy with whom they 
have long-term relationships. 
We continue to let our community 
pharmacies be bullied by pharmacy 
benefit managers like CVS Caremark, 
but we can’t let this continue. With 
winter upon us and the pandemic surg-
ing, there has never been a greater 
need to ensure the viability of our com-
munity pharmacies. 
f 
PROVIDING COVID–19 RELIEF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
WATERS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic crisis continues to 
have a terrible impact throughout the 
Nation. 
Cases are surging, and thousands are 
dying from the virus every day. There 
have been over 16 million United States 
cases, and over 300,000 people have lost 
their lives in the United States. 
Over 20 million people across the 
country are collecting unemployment 
and struggling to make ends meet. In 
California, more than 1.3 million peo-
ple have become unemployed over the 
past year. 
Hunger is growing across the Nation. 
One in five renters is behind on paying 
their rent, meaning that millions are 
on the brink of eviction as months of 
back rent are coming due. 
The Federal Reserve estimates that 
renters in California will owe $1.7 bil-
lion in unpaid rent by the end of the 
year, representing almost a quarter of 
the total rental debt that will have ac-
crued nationwide during the pandemic. 
Small businesses are struggling. As 
many as one-third of small businesses, 
including more than 40 percent of 
Black-owned and Latinx-owned small 
businesses, say they will be forced to 
close their doors for good without im-
mediate relief from Congress. 
Families across the country des-
perately need relief. 
So, it is absolutely essential that 
Congress finally come to a bipartisan 
agreement for a relief bill. As Demo-
crats are nearing a compromise with 
our Republican colleagues, we must en-
sure that the legislation helps all of 
those who are struggling during this 
pandemic. 
It is especially important that the re-
lief bill contains another round of di-
rect stimulus payments for individuals 
and families to help them make ends 
meet. We must also provide additional 
unemployment assistance to those who 
have lost their jobs as a result of the 
crisis. 
As chairwoman of the House Finan-
cial Services Committee, I am working 
hard to secure the inclusion of much- 
needed emergency rental assistance in 
the bill and the extension of the evic-
tion moratorium, as well as funding for 
community development financial in-
stitutions and minority depository in-
stitutions that support access to credit 
and investment in communities of 
color, which have been hit hard by this 
crisis. 
As this pandemic continues to rage, 
it would be completely irresponsible 
and foolish to take away the Federal 
Reserve’s and the Treasury’s crisis 
management tools that can help ad-
dress threats to jobs, small businesses, 
municipal government, and the econ-
omy. 
Let me be clear that the compromise 
bill that is now being worked on, while 
important, will not be enough by itself. 
Families across the country will need 
more help. Congress must work with 
the incoming Biden administration to 
take additional action to support those 
who are struggling every day and put 
the country on a path to recovery.

DEMOCRATS COULD STEAL A 
HOUSE SEAT AGAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to remind my col-
leagues that, in 1985, the Democrats in 
this House stole a seat, and they can do 
it again. 
The day after the election in 1984, Re-
publican Rick McIntyre was ahead of 
incumbent Frank McCloskey by 34 
votes. 
After 
the 
State’s 
recount, 
McIntyre’s lead grew to 418 votes. In 
the weeks following the election, McIn-
tyre was certified the winner of Indi-
ana’s Eighth Congressional District. 
But come January 1985, House Demo-
crats refused to seat the duly-elected 
Member of Congress, Rick McIntyre. 
Instead, they sent a partisan task force 
to Indiana which then determined bal-
lots not valid under Indiana law should 
have been counted. They changed the 
rules. Under the Democrats’ new rules, 
McCloskey was now ahead by four 
votes. 
On May 1, 1985, the House voted to 
seat McCloskey. Ten Democrats joined 
every Republican in voting against 
seating him. This contest was dubbed 
the ‘‘Bloody Eighth,’’ and my Demo-
crat colleagues are considering repeat-
ing this same battle this year in Iowa’s 
Second District. 
Just as in 1985, they are about to 
change the rules of the game after the 
game has already been played. Demo-
crats have been trying to do this in 
States throughout the 2020 cycle. 
After a thorough recount of votes in 
all 24 counties in Iowa’s Second Dis-
trict, Mr. Speaker, and a unanimous bi-
partisan vote by Iowa’s State Can-
vassing Board, Congresswoman-elect 
Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was de-
clared the winner. 
Instead of challenging the certifi-
cation that Dr. Miller-Meeks now has 
in her possession in court, the Demo-
crat candidate has decided to skip that 
step and, instead, is going to ask Wash-
ington Democrats to overturn Iowa’s 
voters. And the reason is because she 
couldn’t win in court. 
But if Washington Democrats change 
the rules, she can. She can disregard 
the people of Iowa. 
Setting this precedent that you don’t 
have to exhaust all of your options and 
prove your case in court, but that 
whatever party is in charge of the 
House can come in, change the rules, 
and determine the winner is a terrible 
precedent to set. 
I am hoping that my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle will think 
long and hard if they want a repeat of 
the Bloody Eighth, because there will 
come a time when the shoe is on the 
other foot. 
The Federal contest of 1985 eroded 
public trust in our elections and under-
mined the integrity of our election

ler-Meeks on January 3. 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESSMAN CLAY 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn’t 
congratulate you on leaving this great 
institution and making this institution 
a much better place for you serving 
with all of us. 
I have enjoyed our time together, fly-
ing back and forth from our districts, 
and I have enjoyed the friendship that 
you and I have been able to have over 
the last 8 years that we have served to-
gether. 
Mr. Speaker, you have done a great 
job representing the district in Mis-
souri right across the river from mine, 
and our partnership is one that is 
bound not just in politics and not just 
in legislating, but in friendship. I am 
going to miss being here with you. 
This institution will be a better 
place, again, because of your service. 
We will all be at a loss without being 
able to go to you and ask you for your 
expertise, your guidance, and just hav-
ing some fun. 
I am going miss you, my friend, but 
our institution’s loss is your personal 
time and your family’s gain, and I look 
forward to working with you in what-
ever the next endeavor is on your hori-
zon. May God continue to bless you. 
f 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESSMAN 
PHIL ROE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate your friendship and your kind-
ness to the 435th most powerful person 
in Congress—that would be me. I really 
do, brother, and I am going to miss 
you. 
Mr. Speaker, after six terms rep-
resenting Tennessee’s First Congres-
sional District, Dr. PHIL ROE is retiring 
at the end of this year. Dr. ROE has fo-
cused his career in the House of Rep-
resentatives on fighting for our Na-
tion’s veterans and using his medical 
background to tackle those tough 
healthcare issues. 
As a matter of fact, during one of the 
State of the Union addresses, someone 
dropped in the back. I turned back to 
Congressman ROE and I said, ‘‘Some-
body has dropped,’’ and before I could 
get ‘‘dropped’’ out of my mouth, he was 
already out of the row providing med-
ical care to him. 
When I arrived in Washington almost 
2 years ago, Dr. ROE was the first per-
son to reach out and offer advice about 
serving in this Chamber. He was a men-
tor throughout my first term, and we 
bonded over our faith by attending 
weekly prayer breakfasts together. His 
mentorship has quickly turned into a 
friendship over the last 2 years—and he 
is an excellent guitar player, Mr. 
Speaker. 
As a legislator, Dr. ROE has always 
looked out for America’s brave service-
men and -women. He served as chair-
man and lead Republican on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, helping pass 
bipartisan bills to improve healthcare 
benefits for our brave veterans. Armed 
servicemembers deserve the very best 
for their sacrifices, and Dr. ROE was al-
ways in their corner. 
Congress will be different next year 
without Dr. ROE, and I will miss work-
ing with him on the issues most impor-
tant to east Tennesseans. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dr. ROE 
on a strong career in Congress, and I 
wish him the very best in retirement. 
CONGRATULATING COACH GARY RANKIN 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Coach Gary 
Rankin and the Alcoa High School 
football team on their sixth consecu-
tive State championship title. 
On Saturday, December 4, at the Ten-
nessee Blue Cross Bowl, Alcoa defeated 
Milan High in an impressive 35–0 shut-
out. This win marks the Tornadoes’ 
19th State championship and Coach 
Rankin’s 16th overall, both of which 
are high school football records in Ten-
nessee. It is certainly a proud day to 
represent this team in the Halls of Con-
gress. 
Amid the ongoing COVID–19 pan-
demic, schools and their sports teams 
had to adjust and readjust. Coach 
Rankin and his players were faced with 
a season like none other, but they put 
in the hours, they persevered, and they 
came out on top. This championship is 
a remarkable achievement that I am 
sure this group of players will remem-
ber for the rest of their lives. 
I know I speak for many in east Ten-
nessee when I say: Congratulations, 
and go Tornadoes. 
RECOGNIZING BISHOP RICHARD STIKA 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Bishop Richard 
Stika of the Knoxville Diocese. This 
week, Bishop Stika is celebrating his 
35th year as an ordained priest of the 
Catholic Church, a remarkable career 
milestone. 
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Bishop 
Stika received a Catholic education 
from elementary school through col-
lege. He capped off his theological edu-
cation by earning a master of divinity 
from Kenrick Seminary. 
Bishop Stika was ordained a priest 
on December 14, 1985, and for nearly 24 
years he served in several different par-
ishes in the St. Louis area. One of his 
greatest achievements during this time 
was coordinating the visit of Pope 
John Paul II to St. Louis in 1999, Mr. 
Speaker. 
On March 19, 2009, he became bishop 
of the Knoxville Diocese, and Bishop 
Stika has been making strong spiritual 
connections 
with 
east 
Tennesseans 
ever since. At 11 years in the Knoxville 
Diocese, Bishop Stika is the longest 
serving bishop in our diocese. 
Bishop Stika and I share many val-
ues, including a strong belief in pro-
tecting the lives of the unborn. Bishop 
Stika has made a positive impact on 
many east Tennesseans throughout his 
tenure, and, Mr. Speaker, I am con-
fident he will continue to be a leader in 
our community. 
CELEBRATING A.G. HEINS COMPANY 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
American entrepreneurial spirit is the 
bedrock of our Nation’s economy, cre-
ating good-paying jobs, solving every-
day problems, and providing the goods 
and services we rely on. I rise today to 
celebrate the A.G. Heins Company, 
which rode the entrepreneurial spirit 
from humble beginnings to 100 years of 
success in our community. 
Currently in its fourth generation of 
family ownership, the A.G. Heins Com-
pany has long provided building mate-
rials to the east Tennessee region. The 
company provides necessary resources 
to complete projects of all sizes, from 
individual household repairs, to con-
struction at the University of Ten-
nessee. 
Staying in business for 100 years is no 
easy accomplishment, and the A.G. 
Heins Company persevered through 
many 
challenging 
economic 
times, 
such as the Great Depression and the 
Second World War. The company’s his-
tory is a reminder that small busi-
nesses can grow and innovate even in 
the face of adversity, Mr. Speaker. 
I extend my congratulations to the 
Heins family as they celebrate their 
100th year in business this month, and 
I wish them many more years of suc-
cess.

CONCERNS WITH A NEW TREND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express concern with a trend that 
could harm our financial system, crush 
jobs, and have lasting negative impacts 
on American competitiveness and eco-
nomic exceptionalism. 
Many on the other side of the aisle 
are calling for financial regulators to 
inject climate risk scenarios into bank 
supervision, and a new administration 
will likely prioritize weaponizing fi-
nancial regulation to achieve unrelated 
climate goals. 
Radical climate activists are incapa-
ble of passing the Green New Deal 
through Congress because most Ameri-
cans understand it will destroy jobs, 
increase energy costs, and destabilize 
our economy at a time of immense fra-
gility and volatility, so they will un-
doubtedly turn to financial regulation 
and supervision as a backdoor to imple-
ment their climate agenda. 
Earlier this year, a group of Demo-
crat Senators put these ideas to paper 
in a partisan report, calling on all Fed-
eral financial regulators to infuse ill- 
defined climate scenarios into their su-
pervision of banks and to discourage fi-
nancial firms from lending to indus-
tries that ‘‘amplify climate risk,’’ such 
as coal or oil and natural gas. Lost on

these Senators is the impact that this 
would have on American jobs and cost 
of living amid a pandemic or the fact 
that financial supervision should rely 
on risk-based metrics rather than pie- 
in-the-sky sustainability goals. 
This week, the Federal Reserve an-
nounced that it joined the Network for 
Greening the Financial System, a con-
sortium of central banks intent on 
weaving climate risk into bank super-
vision. To those of us closely tracking 
this issue, the decision by the Fed 
raises many red flags. 
I take no issue with the Fed partici-
pating in multilateral deliberative bod-
ies. My concern comes from some of 
the ideas being discussed by other 
members of the NGFS and whether the 
Fed plans to import them. 
The NGFS has made a series of rec-
ommendations that are particularly 
troubling. First, it suggests supervisors 
elevate their regulated entities based 
on sustainability metrics in their port-
folios. Unfortunately, there is no clear 
definition 
of 
what 
‘‘sustainability’’ 
means, but you can bet that the cli-
mate activists will push it all the way 
to the brink. 
We do not need European regulators 
to tell our banks how sustainable their 
portfolios should be. Portfolio strength 
should be measured objectively, based 
on credit risk, not on poorly defined 
sustainability goals. 
Second, the NGFS urges regulators 
to integrate climate risks into finan-
cial 
stability 
monitoring. 
Unfortu-
nately, climate stress scenarios are 
plagued 
with 
methodological 
chal-
lenges. Material impacts from chang-
ing weather patterns occur over the 
course of decades; whereas, current 
stress tests look at a period of nine 
quarters. It would be difficult for a 
bank to accurately forecast stresses 
over that length of time, and regu-
lators can’t account for a bank’s dy-
namic operational and risk manage-
ment practices over that period. 
Further, there is a lack of historical 
data 
on 
the 
relationship 
between 
changing weather patterns and finan-
cial stress, and the available data may 
have gaps or a disqualifying level of 
subjectivity. 
b 1330 
Last week, I led a group of 47 House 
Republicans in a letter to Federal Re-
serve Chairman Powell and Vice Chair 
Quarles requesting that they proceed 
cautiously in their deliberations on 
whether to incorporate climate change 
scenarios into financial stress tests. 
The letter highlights many of the 
methodological challenges I just raised 
and encourages them to consider the 
negative impact this would have on 
U.S. industry and American jobs. 
As we mentioned in our letter, it is 
important that the Fed commit to not 
accepting any international climate 
standards that are not appropriately 
tailored to the U.S. financial system or 
that would adversely impact U.S. com-
petitiveness. We expect U.S. regulators 
to make similar commitments when 
adopting other international stand-
ards, such as the Basel Accords and in-
surance standards from the Inter-
national Association of Insurance Su-
pervisors. This should be no different. 
Mr. Speaker, this effort to pressure 
financial regulators to inject climate 
scenarios into bank stress tests is not 
about predicting financial stress. It is 
about causing financial stress, causing 
financial stress for an entire segment 
of the U.S. economy: the energy sector. 
Far from promoting financial sta-
bility, this dangerous movement, right 
at a time of a global pandemic, to po-
liticize access to capital would under-
mine economic stability by denying 
American families and businesses ac-
cess to affordable and reliable energy. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on the Federal 
Reserve to keep this in mind, to keep 
in mind the millions of jobs that are on 
the line, as Congress exercises over-
sight over the Federal Reserve’s man-
date to maximize employment.

ple. Help us all to be mindful of those 
in need of encouragement and support 
through such difficult times. 
Bless as well those who rush now to

their excellent example of service to 
others. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

REMEMBERING DR. AHMAD JABER 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in memory of Dr. 
Ahmad Jaber, who passed away last 
week after a lifetime spent building 
New York’s thriving Muslim-American 
community. 
Dr. Jaber was a towering figure who 
rose from humble origins. He was a 
proud Palestinian who won prestigious 
scholarships to study medicine in Iraq, 
Jordan, and later to do his residency in 
this great country. 
As a young doctor, Dr. Jaber had 
done and seen more than most people 
do in a lifetime, but he did not stop 
there. He built his medical practice in 
Sunset Park into a thriving business, 
personally delivering more than 5,000 
babies. 
He attended to his community’s spir-
itual needs, and he was a fixture at his 
mosque, providing financial support as 
well as translating sermons or offering 
medical assistance. Dr. Jaber helped 
found numerous organizations through-
out his life, which now carry on his leg-
acy of strengthening the Muslim-Amer-
ican community in New York and 
around the country. 
We need more people like Dr. Jaber 
in this country, people who leave their 
mark on society through humble and 
dedicated work on behalf of their com-
munity. 
We are forever grateful to have bene-
fited from Dr. Jaber’s presence, and he 
will 
be 
so 
deeply 
missed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7242 
December 17, 2020 
Ken was born in Keuterville, Idaho, 
on July 28, 1928. He was one of six chil-
dren. About 7 years later, his family 
moved to The Dalles, Oregon, where he 
graduated from St. Mary’s Academy 
High School in 1946. 
Along the way, he met his future 
wife, Marie von Borstel. In the spring 
of 1951, Ken and Marie were married. 
Shortly thereafter, Uncle Sam came 
calling, and Ken was drafted into the 
U.S. Army, where he served during the 
war in Korea. 
After he returned home and earned a 
degree in economics, they settled on a 
wheat ranch in Sherman County. Like 
most ranchers I know, Ken loved the 
land and practiced progressive con-
servation efforts. He enjoyed hunting, 
traveling, 
and 
playing 
cards 
with 
friends. 
It is reported that he was a popular 
poker dealer at the veterans’ home in 
The Dalles, bringing much joy to those 
who, like him, wore our Nation’s uni-
form and preserved our freedom and 
way of life. 
I always appreciated Ken’s friendship 
and counsel over the years. Mylene and 
I extend our deepest sympathies to his 
family during this difficult time of 
loss.

CALLING FOR COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, it 
has been 9 months since Congress deliv-
ered a relief package for the American 
people. Since then, the pandemic has 
grown worse. 
Every time Democrats tried to pass a 
new relief package, the Republicans 
who control the U.S. Senate have 
blocked it from reaching the American 
people. 
This has gone on long enough. It is 
long past time to provide the relief 
that our folks who are living through 
this pandemic need. 
We need to provide another round of 
stimulus payments to workers. We 
need to extend and expand unemploy-
ment insurance. We need to establish a 
national COVID testing program and 
make sure our hospitals and commu-
nity health centers have the resources 
they need to provide lifesaving care. 
We need to help small businesses that 
have already sacrificed so much in the 
face of this pandemic, and we need to 
provide funding so that we can get our 
population vaccinated against this dis-
ease and get our lives back to normal 
as soon as possible. 
Leaving town without an agreement 
is not an option. It is critical that we 
get this done for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to work together to make this 
happen. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO NANCY 
EPOCH 
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge the life and 
work of the late Nancy Epoch. 
This poster shows a picture of her on 
the left. On the right, is college pro-
fessor Sally Glassman, probably the 
best tap dance teacher in Kansas, but 
that is another speech entirely. 
Mrs. Epoch was beloved by all. She 
was a music teacher, a choral director, 
a Chiefs superfan, and a legitimate 
Broadway talent who then returned 
home. 
What she really did was that she en-
abled young and old kids to find their 
voice, be bold, and share it with the 
world. 
So, Mrs. Epoch, from the floor of the 
U.S. House of Representatives to you 
in Heaven, first, I thank you for that 
first Chiefs Super Bowl victory. I am 
pretty sure that that was you. We love 
you, and we miss you. 
f 
PROVIDE COVID RELIEF TO 
FAMILIES 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the people who 
are struggling and feel abandoned by 
their government during this crisis. 
I rise in solidarity with every parent 
who has struggled to buy diapers and 
formula, every family behind on rent 
or crushed by the grief of an empty 
chair at the kitchen table. 
Our people are crying out, sick, tired, 
hungry, and broken. The people we 
have taken an oath to serve and pro-
tect need direct cash to survive the 
winter. We must send them survival 
checks immediately. 
Some of my colleagues are patting 
themselves on the back for sending cor-
porations 
payouts—corporations, 
by 
the way, that have profited off of peo-
ple during this pandemic—and shaming 
families on the edge. Shame on them 
for their theatrics and their callous-
ness. 
450 pennies a day for the last 9 
months, that is what our government 
has sent the American people to weath-
er this crisis, and nothing for the im-
migrant families who drive our essen-
tial workforce. 
It didn’t have to be this way. Our 
families deserve direct cash, real sur-
vival checks. 
Madam Speaker, $600 is hardly suffi-
cient. It is an insult. We must act to 
save lives now. The pandemic has not 
discriminated in its hardship, but it 
would seem compassion and empathy 
have. 
f 
COUNTERING CONFUCIUS 
INSTITUTES 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, there has been a lot of news 
coverage lately on coordinated efforts 
by the Chinese Communist Party to in-
filtrate America’s institutions. 
I am particularly troubled by reports 
revealing efforts by the CCP to exploit 
academic integrity on U.S. college 
campuses. 
We know the CCP is using Confucius 
Institutes to further its agenda. Lo-
cated on college campuses across the 
U.S., Confucius Institutes use their 
platform to spew Chinese Government 
propaganda. 
While Democrats turn a blind eye to 
China’s threat, I am proud my Repub-
lican colleagues and I joined forces on 
the China Task Force and made bipar-
tisan recommendations to Congress on 
how best to counter threats from the 
CCP. 
There is no place for Chinese censor-
ship in America, especially not on col-
lege campuses where American inge-
nuity should take flight. Congress 
must deliver a strong message: CCP 
propaganda will be met with con-
sequences. 
f 
EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR 
ESTHER PAGE 
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my gratitude and 
appreciation for Esther Page, my con-
stituent services director. 
Known as the Constituent Whisperer 
and Queen of Casework, Esther is retir-
ing this January after 31 years of serv-
ice. 
She truly is the model of what a non-
partisan public servant should be, hav-
ing shown the same care and devotion 
for Virginia’s Fifth District even as the 
seat swapped back and forth between 
parties. 
I will read a comment from one of my 
constituents who benefited from Ms. 
Page’s service: ‘‘I felt from her very 
first contact that she was committed 
to advocating for me and my best in-
terests. Without Ms. Page, I truly be-
lieve that I would still be waiting, my 
case file deeply buried on someone’s 
desk.’’ 
Her devout faith was an example to 
me and all constituents she helped. She 
will be retiring to her home in Nelson 
County this January, and I wish her a 
long and fulfilling retirement. 
Esther, I think I speak for all the 
Fifth District in offering my deepest 
appreciation for the service you have 
done. 
This is not in the speech but know 
that we all love you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7243 
December 17, 2020 
Mr. Yeager was a war hero, an in-
credible pilot, and a great West Vir-
ginian. 
Born in Lincoln County in the small 
town of Myra, Chuck was a stellar ath-
lete and a bright student who enlisted 
in the Air Force during World War II, 
answering the call to serve. 
As a pilot, he was known for his out-
standing leadership and flying skills, 
and his incredible vision. I am also 
proud to say that he never lost his 
steadfast West Virginia spirit. 
Flying over 61 missions as an ace, he 
returned home from the war in 1945. He 
then became a test pilot who re-
searched high-speed flight. 
In 1947, Chuck was the first person to 
break the sound barrier, flying over the 
Mojave Desert, and went on to accom-
plish more in the field of flight while 
serving in the Air Force until 1971. 
He was one of America’s greatest pi-
lots. 
Chuck passed away this month at the 
age of 97. He lived a life of adventure, 
patriotism, service, and strength. He 
will always be remembered.

RECOGNIZING STEVE NELSON 
(Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Steve Nelson, a corn and soybean farm-
er from Axtell, Nebraska, on his retire-
ment as president of the Nebraska 
Farm Bureau. 
The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a lead-
ing voice for Nebraska agriculture pro-
ducers because of its hardworking 
members and leaders like Steve, whose 
hard work and leadership have made 
the Third District of Nebraska the top- 
producing agriculture district in Amer-
ica. 
Steve 
has 
served 
as 
president 
through the completion of two farm 
bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska 
producers 
are 
reflected 
and 
met 
throughout the process—no small task. 
I have appreciated Steve’s persist-
ence in the face of many challenges we 
have faced in Nebraska recently, espe-
cially the historic floods, storms, the 
irrigation tunnel collapse, and cer-
tainly other uncertainties. Those af-
fected, though, were always able to 
turn to the Nebraska Farm Bureau. 
I would like to thank Steve for his 
great work, and I wish him well as he 
continues as a farm producer at home 
and advocating for our State’s farmers 
and ranchers.

JOSEPH BULLOCK POST OFFICE 
BUILDING 
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MAST. ‘‘Blessed are the peace-
makers, for they will be called children 
of God.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I rise today because 
the life and sacrifice of a true peace-
maker, Trooper Joseph Bullock, will be 
honored by our passing of legislation to 
rename the postal facility in Port 
Salerno, Florida, as the Joseph Bullock 
Post Office Building. 
Though he knew the risk, his story is 
not how a watch should end. And as we 
see his name each day in Port Salerno, 
we will be reminded of the valor within 
all of our law enforcement who, each 
day, commit to our communities the 
most significant thing that they have: 
their life. 
Trooper Bullock, we salute you.

THE WRIGHT BROTHERS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, on 
this day in 1903, near Kitty Hawk, 
North Carolina, Orville and Wilbur 
Wright made the first successful air-
craft flight in history. 
In the years leading up to their first 
flight, they built and tested air gliders 
in their bicycle shop in their hometown 
of Dayton, Ohio. After making hun-
dreds of successful flights in their glid-
er, they designed a 12-horsepower en-
gine to fit into the frame. 
In the fall of 1903, the Wright broth-
ers transported these pieces down to 
Kitty Hawk, assembled it, and made 
their first attempt at powered flight. 
Unfortunately, the engine stalled dur-
ing takeoff and the engine was dam-
aged. After making a few repairs, on 
December 17, Orville ran the aircraft 
down a track and into the air, flying 
120 feet for 12 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, of course, in the 117 
years since, we have seen amazing 
leaps in aircraft ability and tech-
nology. Forty-four years after, Chuck 
Yeager broke the sound barrier, and 
now we have people landing on the 
Moon and satellite equipment going be-
yond the stretches of our solar system. 
The Wright brothers’ story is one of 
our most well-told tales of success in 
American modern innovation. Their 
drive and spirit is something that can 
inspire us all.

CONGRATULATIONS TOM MCCALL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Mr. Tom McCall of Elbert County, 
Georgia, for being elected president of 
Georgia’s largest general farm organi-
zation, the Georgia Farm Bureau, on 
December 8. Tom replaces Gerald Long, 
who retired from the position after 
serving as GFB president since 2016. 
He has been a dedicated Farm Bureau 
member since 1978, and Tom’s first 
leadership role with the bureau was 
serving as the chairman of the Elbert 
County Farm Bureau Young Farmers 
and Ranchers Committee. Tom also 
represented Georgia Farm Bureau’s 
second district on the GFB board of di-
rectors and served as Elbert County 
Farm Bureau’s president for several 
years. 
The foundation of his leadership 
skills was developed when he served in 
the Georgia House of Representatives 
for 26 years. I was blessed to serve 
alongside Tom for 5 years in the Geor-
gia State House, so I can attest to his 
dedication to improving the lives of his 
constituents and his commitment to 
the State of Georgia. 
His wealth of knowledge in agri-
culture contributed to his success 
while serving on the Georgia House Ag-
riculture and Consumer Affairs Com-
mittee, and I know his continued com-
mitment to improving agriculture in 
the State of Georgia will allow him to 
thrive as Georgia Farm Bureau’s presi-
dent. 
I wish him the best as he steps up to 
lead farmers across Georgia, and I 
know he will do a great job.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from

tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, nearly 250 years 
ago, a group of visionaries met in 
Philadelphia for the Second Conti-
nental Congress. Out of this unusual 
meeting of daring patriots, a declara-
tion was produced stating to the world 
that, for the first time in the modern 
world, 13 Colonies would join together 
to become one independent nation—the 
United States of America, the greatest 
experiment in democracy that the 
world has ever seen. 
Madam Speaker, these leaders boldly 
declared that no more would Ameri-
cans live under the tyranny of a nation 
3,000 miles away. They acted with 
unity and decided that our Nation will 
not be built upon privilege inherited by 
birth, but natural rights that belonged 
to each and every person. 
In 2026, the United States will cele-
brate 250 years of independence. While 
we have not always lived up to these 
lofty ideals, we have continued to work 
to make progress and right the wrongs. 
To commemorate and celebrate the 
founding of our Republic in 2016, Con-
gress established the United States 
Semiquincentennial Commission. The 
Commission’s goal is to encourage 
Americans to remember our past, cele-
brate our present, and look forward to 
a promising future. The Commission 
works with public and private entities 
across the country to make celebra-
tions of our 250th year of independence 
a time to remember for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, while the Commis-
sion has done incredible work thus far, 
the Commission Amendments Act will 
make needed updates to ensure that 
the Commission has the resources and 
talent it needs to fulfill its mission of 
national importance. 
This bill will expand the membership 
to include cultural and historical per-
spectives from individuals such as the 
chairperson of the National Endow-
ment for the Arts and the National En-
dowment for the Humanities. In addi-
tion, the bill will provide necessary in-
tellectual property protections for the 
materials created by the Commission. 
This commonsense legislation will 
serve to further enable the Commission 
to carry on its important work. It has 
never been more important for us to 
come together or remember our past, 
acknowledge our present, and look for-
ward to our future as one nation de-
voted to the ideals of liberty and jus-
tice for all. 
As someone who was born in 1976, in 
Philadelphia, the year of our bicen-
tenary, this has a particular meaning 
to me. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Senator 
TOOMEY and others on the committee 
for advancing this. Our Nation will be 
the first multiracial, multiethnic de-
mocracy in the history of the world, 
and it is a credit to our founding vi-
sion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 
3989, 
the 
United 
States 
Semiquincentennial 
Commission 
Amendments Act. 
Our country’s Declaration of Inde-
pendence was courageously signed in 
1776. This makes 2026 the 250th anniver-
sary our great Republic and its found-
ing. 
An exposition marking the 150th an-
niversary was in Philadelphia in 1926, 
and 
bicentennial 
celebrations 
were 
held throughout the country in 1976. It 
is only fitting that we also celebrate 
the 250th anniversary, another mile-
stone anniversary. 
To do this, Congress passed and the 
President signed the United States 
Semiquincentennial Commission Act of 
2016 in the 114th Congress. The bill be-
fore us today would amend the law au-
thorizing the Commission, with nec-
essary changes, to allow the planning 
work to continue. S. 3989 grants the 
Commission certain flexibilities, such 
as no longer requiring every meeting 
convene at Independence Hall in Phila-
delphia. The law would still recognize 
Philadelphia’s importance and requires 
at least one meeting per year to be 
held in the City of Brotherly Love. 
This bill, S. 3989, would add the direc-
tors of several Federal agencies focused

on the arts to assist with the planning. 
The bill would also grant the Commis-
sion exclusive rights over their official 
logo for commercial licensing purposes, 
which would help provide additional 
funding resources for the Commission’s 
work. These changes will allow the 
Commission and the rest of the United 
States to better celebrate our coun-
try’s 250th anniversary. 
Madam Speaker, as the Commission 
noted in their 2020 report to the Presi-
dent, ‘‘America 250,’’ the central theme 
of the celebrations, will be ‘‘educate, 
engage, and unite.’’ Specifically, the 
Commission’s primary goal with these 
celebrations is to inspire the American 
spirit; to deepen the understanding of 
our history and the democratic process 
through education; increase engage-
ment in our communities and gov-
erning affairs; and foster unity, that 
includes the many Americans in our 
‘‘one Nation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I think my col-
leagues would agree that more than 
ever, Americans stand to benefit from 
a national celebration reflecting on our 
shared values which unite us as a coun-
try, a country uniquely founded on a 
set of ideals. 
Every one of us owes a debt of grati-
tude to the framework of freedoms, 
rights, and government institutions 
our Founding Fathers established with 
such a discerning forethought. We look 
forward to the Commission’s plans 
being finalized next year and for the 
forthcoming celebrations of America’s 
founding, a country we all love so well. 
Madam Speaker, we look forward to 
celebrating the 250th anniversary of 
America’s founding. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I re-
iterate my support for this legislation, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
KHANNA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3989, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DEEMING AN URBAN INDIAN OR-
GANIZATION AND EMPLOYEES A 
PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERV-
ICE 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6535) to deem an urban Indian 
organization and employees thereof to 
be a part of the Public Health Service 
for the purposes of certain claims for 
personal injury, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6535 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DEEMING AN URBAN INDIAN ORGANI-
ZATION AND EMPLOYEES THEREOF 
TO BE A PART OF THE PUBLIC 
HEALTH SERVICE FOR THE PUR-
POSES OF CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR 
PERSONAL INJURY. 
Title V of the Indian Health Care Improve-
ment Act (25 U.S.C. 1651) is amended by add-
ing at the end the following: 
‘‘SEC. 519. DEEMING AN URBAN INDIAN ORGANI-
ZATION AND EMPLOYEES THEREOF 
TO BE A PART OF THE PUBLIC 
HEALTH SERVICE FOR THE PUR-
POSES OF CERTAIN CLAIMS FOR 
PERSONAL INJURY. 
‘‘Section 102(d) of the Indian Self-Deter-
mination and Education Assistance Act shall 
apply— 
‘‘(1) to an Urban Indian organization to the 
same extent and in the same manner as such 
section applies to an Indian tribe, a tribal or-
ganization, and an Indian contractor; and 
‘‘(2) to the employees of an Urban Indian 
organization to the same extent and in the 
same manner as such section applies to em-
ployees of an Indian tribe, a tribal organiza-
tion, or an Indian contractor.’’. 
SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GALLEGO) and the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6535, the Cov-
erage for Urban Indian Health Pro-
viders Act, is a bipartisan bill authored 
by 
myself 
and 
Representative 
MARKWAYNE MULLIN of Oklahoma. 
This bill would uphold our trust re-
sponsibility, provide long-overdue par-
ity to the Indian Health System by ex-
tending Federal Tort Claims Act cov-
erage to urban Indian organizations, 
and direct their scarce resources to 
saving lives instead of bureaucratic 
overhead. 
This broadly supported policy change 
was also included in the President’s fis-
cal year 2021 budget proposal. 
As part of our trust and treaty re-
sponsibilities, the U.S. Government has 
a 
legal 
responsibility 
to 
provide 
healthcare to Native Americans and 
Alaska Natives. Congress created the 
Indian Health System to carry out this 
obligation. 
The Indian Health System is made up 
of the Indian Health Service; Tribal 
health programs; and urban Indian or-
ganizations, known as UIOs. 
UIOs play a pivotal role in upholding 
the trust responsibility by providing 
culturally competent care to the over 
70 percent of American Indians and 
Alaska Natives who live in urban 
areas, like my district in Phoenix, Ari-
zona. 
However, despite the pivotal role 
they play, UIOs are the only branch of 
the Indian Health System that are not 
currently eligible for liability coverage 
under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 
known as FTCA. 
As a result, each UIO is forced to 
spend up to $250,000 per year on indi-
vidual medical liability policies. If we 
pass this bill today, that quarter of a 
million dollars will instead be spent di-
rectly on patient care and the re-
sources these clinics need to fight 
COVID–19. That is why passing H.R. 
6535 is especially critical now, in the 
midst of a pandemic that has hit Na-
tive populations the hardest, and UIOs 
have been disproportionately the ones 
servicing them and also hit hard. 
This year, over 80 percent of UIOs 
have cut services due to the resource 
shortages they are experiencing, and at 
least three have had to shut their doors 
during the first wave of the pandemic. 
Cuts to services are devastating for the 
vulnerable Native communities and the 
UIOs that serve them. I know because I 
have heard from my constituents what 
a critical role UIOs, like Native Health 
of Phoenix, play in the daily lives of 
urban Indians. 
From free food deliveries during the 
pandemic to seniors and low-income 
families, to COVID testing, primary 
care, and social services, UIOs and 
their staffs are pillars of the commu-
nities they serve and they save lives. 
These heroic frontline staffs should 
not be singled out for exclusion from 
coverage under FTCA merely due to 
which part of the Indian Health Sys-
tem they serve in. Passing H.R. 6535 
would immediately make these health 
providers eligible for FTCA coverage, 
and it would create a financial lifeline 
for these cash-strapped health clinics 
serving on the front lines of the pan-
demic. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
frontline health workers, support Na-
tive communities, and support uphold-
ing our trust responsibilities by voting 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6535 would 
amend the Indian Health Care Improve-
ment Act to extend Federal Tort 
Claims Act coverage to urban Indian

organizations, or UIOs. It would do so 
by deeming the UIOs and their employ-
ees part of the Public Health Service. 
Currently, urban Indian health orga-
nizations need to purchase liability in-
surance with resources that could be 
better utilized to expand services to 
Native Americans. The rising costs of 
liability insurance and the general cost 
of providing healthcare services ad-
versely impact the ability of UIOs to 
provide needed services. As a result, 
services are often substantially re-
duced or certain types of staff are 
eliminated. 
The Indian Health Service deems 
UIOs an integral part of the Indian 
healthcare system. They provide high- 
quality, culturally relevant healthcare 
and are often the only healthcare pro-
viders 
readily 
accessible 
to 
urban 
American Indian and Alaska Native pa-
tients. 
While there is general agreement and 
support that Federal Tort Claims Act 
protections should be extended to UIO 
health facilities, I am disappointed 
that the majority failed to consider 
technical amendments provided by the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
Requests to address these legitimate 
concerns were dismissed shortly after 
Chairman GRIJALVA of the Natural Re-
sources Committee agreed to keep 
working on the legislation before it 
would be considered on the House floor. 
These technical changes would improve 
the legislation, which may now face an 
uncertain future in the Senate. That 
shortsightedness only hurts the very 
Native Americans that this bill is try-
ing to help. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 6585 with deep reservations. 
I support the substance of the measure as 
addressing key concerns for American Indians 
and Alaska Natives. My grave concern is with 
the inexplicable omission of Native Hawaiians 
as indistinguishably indigenous peoples of this 
country to be treated and included the same. 
I spelled out my concerns at length in a 
submission to the record of my Committee on 
Natural Resources on this measure and I in-
clude in the RECORD my statement: 
U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources: 
July 29, 2020 Full Committee Markup on H.R. 
6535: 
Additional Remarks for the Record: 
U.S. Congressman Ed Case: 
Chairman 
Grijalva, 
Ranking 
Member 
Bishop and fellow Committee members, I re-
spectfully submit these additional remarks 
for the record on H.R. 6535, introduced by my 
friend and colleague on the Committee, Mr. 
Gallego, also Chair of the Committee’s Sub-
committee on Indigenous Peoples of the 
United States on which I am also honored to 
serve. 
H.R. 6535, considered and unanimously re-
ported by this Committee on July 29, 2020, 
would extend federal tort claims coverage 
for certain personal injury claims to urban 
Indian organizations by deeming them part 
of the Public Health Service, similar to cur-
rent coverage provided to Indian tribes, trib-
al organizations, Indian contractors and em-
ployees. I fully endorse this measure and was 
pleased to be able to support it in both Sub-
committee and full Committee. 
However, I must register my deep concern 
that Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems 
(NHHCS) have not also been extended the 
same coverage in this measure or otherwise. 
Although there are legitimate procedural 
and related non-substantive reasons for not 
including them in this specific vehicle, I 
wish to affirm for the record that this is 
clearly unfinished business that should and 
must be remedied by this Committee and 
Congress at the earliest opportunity. 
The current federal tort claims coverage 
extends to many health care providers serv-
ing American Indian and Alaska Native indi-
viduals in the Indian Health Service (IHS) 
and tribal facilities as part of the under-
takings and obligations of our country to 
our indigenous peoples. Whole segments of 
our indigenous populations depend on these 
providers for their health needs, in par-
ticular primary and preventive care. The 
practical effect of covering these critical or-
ganizations under the Federal Tort Claims 
Act (FTCA) is to simplify the processing and 
resolution of medical malpractice and other 
personal injury claims against the organiza-
tion, which expedites settlement of legiti-
mate claims and decreases administrative 
and related expense burdens, thus enabling 
providers to deliver more extensive and bet-
ter service to their communities. 
FTCA coverage has extended for decades to 
the IHS and tribal organizations including 
indigenous-focused federally qualified health 
centers (to include Native Hawaiian Commu-
nity Health Centers (NHCHC).) However, for 
reasons that reflect simple omission rather 
than any other explanation, urban Indian or-
ganizations and NHHCS, first established 
under the Native Hawaiian Health Care Im-
provement Act of 1988, are not currently cov-
ered under the FTCA. This bill would correct 
that as to urban Indian organizations but 
not NHHCS. 
There is no policy or functional differen-
tiation among urban Indian organizations, 
NHHCS, tribal organizations and NHCHC in 
FTCA coverage, nor between NHHCS and 
urban Indian organizations. Both urban In-
dian organizations and NHHCS are devoted 
to the same needs for the same reasons as 
the others. In fact, in Hawai’i, where we have 
the largest population of Native Hawaiians 
of any state but relatively few Native Ameri-
cans and Alaska Natives, our NHHCS actu-
ally contract with the IHS to provide our 
own and visiting Native Americans and Alas-
ka Natives with reduced cost health care and 
payer of last resort services (and at actual 
costs 
that 
far 
exceed 
the 
contracted 
amounts). 
Moreover, in the public health context, 
there is every reason for Native Hawaiians to 
seek the same benefits as afforded to other 
indigenous organizations under FTCA cov-
erage. Even aside from COVID–19, Native Ha-
waiians suffer from the shortest life expect-
ancy of the major ethnic groups in Hawai’i 
due to underlying medical conditions such as 
diabetes, coronary heart disease and asthma. 
With higher unemployment rates, Native Ha-
waiians are in particular need of the cul-
turally relevant, lower cost health care op-
tions offered by Native Hawaiian-focused or-
ganizations like NHHCS. All this has been 
worsened by COVID–19, which has inflicted 
some of the highest infection and mortality 
rates on Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 
communities nationwide. The extension of 
FTCA to NHHCC is just one of many initia-
tives that can make a real difference in en-
suring NHHCS can continue to serve their 
own populations in these times of great chal-
lenge and need. 
During my Subcommittee on the Indige-
nous Peoples of the United States’ July 19, 
2020 hearing on H.R. 6535, I asked IHS Direc-
tor RADM Michael D. Weahkee whether 
there was any policy reason to differentiate 
between NHHCS, urban Indian organizations 
and other tribal health care providers in 
FTCA 
coverage. 
Director 
Weahkee 
re-
sponded: ‘‘In one of my roles as Indian 
Health Service Director, I serve as the Vice 
Chair of the Interdepartmental Council on 
Native American Affairs at the Department 
of Health and Human Services, and that re-
sponsibility extends not only to our Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native populations, 
but also to our Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islanders, and so in that chair I would see 
the same advantage toward Native Hawaiian 
programs as I discussed here today for our 
American Indian urban Indian organiza-
tions.’’ Further, the Congressional Budget 
Office previously reviewed similar legisla-
tion, the Native Hawaiian Health Care Im-
provement Reauthorization Act of 2003, and 
determined there was no appreciable cost to 
the federal government. 
Aside from these bill specifics, I ask this 
Committee to understand and appreciate my 
Native Hawaiian community’s goal of ex-
tending FTCA coverage to NHHCS, and its 
great concern at being excluded from H.R. 
6535, as not just a policy inconsistency but in 
a much broader context. To repeat, Native 
Hawaiians are the indigenous peoples of our 
country to the same degree and extent as 
other indigenous peoples. As such, the 
United States has undertaken a similar spe-
cial trust responsibility to Native Hawaiians 
dating back to Hawaii’s entry into the 
United States as a territory in 1900, and con-
tinuing through the seminal century-old Ha-
waiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and 
some 150-plus more Native Hawaiian federal 
statutes and equally if not more numerous 
specific regulations, administrative actions 
and other initiative since including the Na-
tive Hawaiian Education Act and Native Ha-
waiian Health Care Improvement Act. This 
is not a new or questionable relationship in 
any way and has the same long and often dif-
ficult history as other indigenous peoples. 
Notwithstanding, Native Hawaiians have 
faced decades of being overlooked, ignored 
and excluded in our federal initiatives to ful-
fill our country’s trust responsibilities to 
our indigenous peoples. It has proven too 
easy to ask Native Hawaiians to just wait 
while we take care of another indigenous 
concern first, while too often the wait has 
not materialized into any later action. So 
please understand that when Native Hawai-
ians express great concern over exclusion 
from a seemingly straightforward bill like 
H.R. 6535, their skepticism, apprehension and 
distrust has deep roots that transcend this 
specific bill. 
Chair, Ranking Member and Committee 
colleagues, I personally appreciate your con-
sideration of my additional remarks on be-
half of our country’s vital Native Hawaiian 
community, and hope that I have provided 
you with some broader appreciation of why 
we believe that inclusion of NHHCS in FTCA 
coverage as is provided for virtually all other 
indigenous health care organizations is so 
important. I look forward to working with 
your and our like-minded colleagues to 
achieve such inclusion in other appropriate 
vehicles. 
Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much). 
I fully expect that further measures I am 
asked to support of benefit to American Indi-
ans and Alaska Natives will include Native 
Hawaiians. 
Thank you.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GALLEGO) and the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3250, the Julius Rosenwald 
and Rosenwald Schools Act, introduced 
by Representative DANNY DAVIS. 
This bill directs the National Park 
Service to conduct a study of sites as-
sociated with the life and legacy of Ju-
lius Rosenwald. 
Julius Rosenwald was an American 
businessman and philanthropist, who is 
well known for his role as part owner 
and president of Sears, Roebuck and 
Company. 
In the early 20th century, Rosenwald 
used his wealth to fund Progressive Era 
projects and causes, particularly those 
with a focus on enhancing the lives of 
African Americans. 
Rosenwald was instrumental in the 
construction of 25 YMCAs across the 
country, including Chicago’s historic 
Wabash Avenue YMCA, which provided 
African Americans with housing and 
job training during the Great Migra-
tion. 
Through his efforts with the YMCA, 
Rosenwald developed a relationship 
with Booker T. Washington and was in-
vited to serve on the board of directors 
of the Tuskegee Institute. 
At Tuskegee, Rosenwald funded a 
pilot program that helped build six 
schools for African-American children 
in rural Alabama. This partnership ul-
timately sparked the creation of the 
Rosenwald Fund, which constructed 
more than 5,300 Rosenwald Schools and 
related buildings across the South. 
By 1928, one in every five rural 
schools in the South was a Rosenwald 
School, providing education to one- 
third of all African-American children 
in the South through the 1940s. 
Many Americans are unaware of the 
tremendous contributions that Julius 
Rosenwald and the Rosenwald Schools 
made to our country. I would like to 
thank Representative DAVIS for this ef-
fort to elevate this incredible part of 
our Nation’s history. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3250 would re-
quire the Secretary of the Interior to 
conduct a special resource study of the 
sites associated with the legacy of Ju-
lius Rosenwald, with special focus on 
the Rosenwald Schools. 
Julius Rosenwald was born in 1862, 
while Abraham Lincoln was President, 
in a house just a block away from Lin-
coln in Springfield, Illinois. He would 
eventually play his own major role in 
helping to elevate our Nation’s Afri-
can-American citizenry. 
A 
child 
of 
German 
immigrants, 
Rosenwald dropped out of high school 
after two years to apprentice with his 
uncles, who were major clothing manu-
facturers in New York City. He was ac-
tive in the wholesale clothing business 
from 1879, until he joined Sears and 
Roebuck in 1895. Rosenwald became 
vice president and part owner of the 
company. Sears was the Amazon of its 
day, and Rosenwald went to extraor-
dinary lengths to keep up with its 
growth. 
After stepping down as president of 
Sears in 1924, Mr. ROSEnwald devoted 
most of his time to philanthropy. Over 
the course of his life, he donated mil-
lions of dollars to public schools, col-
leges and universities, museums, Jew-
ish charities, and African-American in-
stitutions. 
Of all of his philanthropic efforts, 
Rosenwald was most famous for the 
more than 5,000 Rosenwald Schools he 
established throughout the South for 
poor, rural African-American youth, 
and the 4,000 libraries he added to ex-
isting schools. These schools were co-
operatively built with the assistance 
from the local African-American com-
munities. Donations of land and labor 
by the local community were matched 
by 
financial 
contributions 
of 
the 
Rosenwald Fund. 
In fact, the great legacy is the num-
ber of leaders in the African-American 
community that would come back and

actually 
teach 
in 
the 
Rosenwald 
Schools. It was this effort, along with 
Julius Rosenwald, that highlighted the 
disparities in the United States edu-
cational system and highlighted the 
objectionable nature of separate but 
equal tenets that predominated the 
school system under the law. 
In fact, it was these efforts that 
helped Thurgood Marshall, when he ar-
gued the case in 1954 before the Su-
preme Court, Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation, to successfully overturn these 
separate but equal tenets of U.S. law at 
the time and found that separate but 
equal was indeed unconstitutional. 
It was the efforts of Julius Rosen-
wald, plus the tireless efforts of Afri-
can-American communities across the 
United States, that finally got to a 
place that said, No, this is not the way 
our school system should operate; we 
should, in fact, take up the cause of Af-
rican-American 
communities; 
they 
should, indeed, have equal school sys-
tems that are not separate but that 
have all the assets and all the efforts 
and all the focus that other schools had 
at the time. 
This was the foundation of that. 
Rosenwald, through his funding of 
these schools, actually was able to ele-
vate that issue to national prominence. 
I believe, and many others believe, too, 
that it was one of the underlying prin-
ciples and arguments that Thurgood 
Marshall made before the Supreme 
Court in 1954. 
In recent years, the National Trust 
for Historic Preservation, in several 
State historic offices, have initiated 
programs 
to 
survey 
the 
surviving 
Rosenwald Schools. In fact, in the 
First Congressional District of Vir-
ginia, there are a number of remaining 
Rosenwald School buildings that are, 
incredibly, in very good shape. 
In fact, many of the community or-
ganizations have purchased the build-
ings, have raised money to renovate 
the buildings, and put them back into 
their original condition so that people 
can actually see how education took 
place at that time. 
They highlight, too, leaders in the 
African-American community who ac-
tually went there and taught at those 
schools. Remember, these teachers did 
everything. They came in, they stoked 
the fires in the stove, and they pre-
pared lunches for the students. They 
did everything to keep these schools 
running. This is a tremendous story 
that needs to continue to be told across 
the Nation. 
As I said, these are indispensable 
parts of our community. This bill 
would authorize a study to evaluate 
the national significance of selected 
Rosenwald School sites and determine 
the suitability and feasibility of desig-
nating these sites as a unit of the Na-
tional Park System. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3250, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Julius Rosenwald and 
Rosenwald Schools Study Act, a bill I intro-
duced with Representative DANNY DAVIS and 
Senator DICK DURBIN from Illinois. It is also co-
sponsored by 43 of our colleagues in the 
House of Representatives and nine Senators. 
This bill would begin the process to estab-
lish a Julius Rosenwald & Rosenwald Schools 
National Historical Park to focus on the incred-
ible impact of Julius Rosenwald, a successful 
entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist who 
made lasting contributions to the advancement 
of African American education during the 
twentieth century. 
Mr. Rosenwald was the President of Sears, 
Roebuck & Company who used his fortune to 
enhance the lives of others—establishing mu-
seums, community centers, and housing as 
well as helping Jews in Europe and new immi-
grants to the U.S. Moved by Booker T. Wash-
ington’s autobiography Up from Slavery, Mr. 
Rosenwald committed his time and finances to 
improving the lives of African Americans. No-
tably, he established the Julius Rosenwald 
Fund that partnered with local communities to 
create over 5,300 schools in the south to ad-
dress the lack of education for African Ameri-
cans. During the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, 
one-third of all African American children in 
the south were educated in Rosenwald 
schools. A 2011 study by two Federal Reserve 
economists concluded that the schools played 
a significant role in narrowing the education 
gap between black and white students in the 
south. 
In addition, Mr. Rosenwald provided match-
ing funds to communities for construction of 
YMCA’s for African Americans during the Jim 
Crow era. The Rosenwald Fund supported the 
early NAACP cases that eventually led to the 
Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, pro-
vided fellowship to African Americans in the 
arts and sciences, and supported a number of 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 
including Fisk, Dillard, and Howard. Mr. 
Rosenwald improved the lives of those in Chi-
cago as well, creating the Jewish United Fund 
of Metropolitan Chicago and the Museum of 
Science and Industry among many other local 
initiatives. When I was seven years old, our 
first family vacation was to my mother’s home-
town of Chicago. During that trip, we went to 
the Museum of Science and Industry, which 
my mother and others referred to as ‘‘the 
Rosenwald.’’ That memory led me to dig into 
the life of Julius Rosenwald as an adult. My 
dear and late friend, Julian Bond, told me 
about 
the 
Rosenwald 
schools 
and 
that 
furthered my appreciation of this man’s far-
sightedness, empathy and wisdom. 
The esteemed contralto singer Marian An-
derson, discriminated against in the Jim Crow 
South, won a prestigious Julius Rosenwald 
Fellowship that allowed her to tour Europe, 
entertaining heads of state, making headlines 
in American newspapers and creating ‘‘Marian 
Mania’’ around the world. Returning to the 
United States, she was invited by President 
Franklin Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor 
Roosevelt to play the White House in 1936 
and, famously, sang ‘‘My Country ’Tis of 
Thee’’ from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial 
on Easter Sunday 1939 after being denied the 
stage of the Daughters of the American Revo-
lution Constitution Hall by segregationists. 
The documentary, ‘‘Rosenwald,’’ by Aviva 
Kempner was a fitting tribute to Julius Rosen-
wald. I was privileged to be present for a 
showing at the White House East Wing when 
Barack Obama was president and Valerie 
Jarrett was his senior advisor. Ms. Jarrett’s 
maternal grandfather, Robert Rochon Taylor, 
was involved in carrying on the legacy of Ju-
lius Rosenwald by helping to plan, build and 
manage what became known as Rosenwald 
Courts, 
a 
multiunit 
housing 
complex 
in 
Bonzeville. 
Julius Rosenwald was a visionary philan-
thropist whose altruism—and philosophy of 
giving embodied the Jewish concept of 
tzedakah—social justice and charity. It’s past 
time to ensure his legacy receives its due 
place in history. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the swift passage of the Julius Rosenwald 
and Rosenwald Schools Study Act.

PEACE CORPS COMMEMORATIVE 
WORK EXTENSION ACT 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7460) to extend the authority 
for the establishment by the Peace 
Corps Commemorative Foundation of a 
commemorative work to commemorate 
the mission of the Peace Corps and the 
ideals on which the Peace Corps was 
founded, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7460 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Peace Corps 
Commemorative Work Extension Act’’.

LISHMENT 
OF 
COMMEMORATIVE 
WORK TO COMMEMORATE THE MIS-
SION OF THE PEACE CORPS AND 
THE IDEALS ON WHICH THE PEACE 
CORPS WAS FOUNDED. 
Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40,

revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 7460, the Peace Corps Com-
memorative Work Extension Act, in-
troduced by Representative JOE KEN-
NEDY. 
Representative KENNEDY served as a 
Peace Corps volunteer in the Domini-
can Republic from 2004 to 2006. Unfor-
tunately, he is not able to be here for 
today’s vote, but I know how much this 
means to him and the entire Returned 
Peace Corps Volunteers community. 
In 2014, the bipartisan Peace Corps 
Commemorative Act was signed into 
law to establish a commemorative 
work to celebrate the Peace Corps and 
its founding ideals. That legislation au-
thorized the Peace Corps Commemora-
tive Foundation to establish the me-
morial in Washington, D.C., but the au-
thorization for the project is set to ex-
pire in January 2021. 
The Peace Corps’ roots and mission 
date back to the 1960s. Since then, 
more than 240,000 Peace Corps volun-
teers have served in 142 host countries 
to train local communities across the 
world in technologies and skills such as 
agricultural protection, environmental 
protection, and basic education. 
Since its establishment, the Peace 
Corps has helped promote world peace 
and friendship by improving the lives 
of countless individuals across the 
world. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Representative KENNEDY for his 
efforts to honor these incredible volun-
teers. 
The planned memorial will be a last-
ing tribute to the legacy of the Peace 
Corps and its mission. This bill simply 
provides the foundation with more 
time to raise money and pick an appro-
priate design. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 7460, the Peace 
Corps Commemorative Work Extension 
Act, extends through January 24, 2028, 
the authority of the Peace Corps Com-
memorative Foundation to establish a 
commemorative work on Federal land 
in the District of Columbia or its envi-
rons to honor and commemorate the 
mission and ideals of the Peace Corps. 
Since President John F. Kennedy es-
tablished the Peace Corps in 1961, over 
235,000 Americans have served as grass-
roots volunteers in villages and towns 
in 141 countries worldwide. Peace Corps 
volunteers seek to promote world peace 
and friendship by improving the lives 
of those they serve by helping others 
understand American culture and by 
bringing their experience back home to 
America. 
It is fitting that this bill to extend 
the Commemorative Works Act author-
ization for a Peace Corps Memorial is 
sponsored by President John F. Ken-
nedy’s 
grandnephew, 
Representative 
JOE KENNEDY III. 
I am grateful to the thousands of 
Americans who have served our Nation 
honorably in the Peace Corps. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Julius Rosenwald and the 
Rosenwald Schools Act, and I thank 
leadership for putting it on the suspen-
sion calendar. 
This bill starts the process to estab-
lish a Julius Rosenwald and Rosenwald 
Schools national historical park to 
focus on the incredible impact of Ju-
lius Rosenwald, a successful entre-
preneur and renowned philanthropist 
who made a lasting contribution to the 
advancement of African-American edu-
cation during the 20th century. 
Mr. Rosenwald was the president of 
Sears, Roebuck and Company during 
its heyday. He used his fortune to en-
hance the lives of others, establishing 
museums, 
community 
centers, 
and 
housing, as well as helping Jews in Eu-
rope and new immigrants coming to 
the United States. One-third of all Af-
rican-American children in the South 
during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s were 
educated in Rosenwald schools. 
Although I did not attend a Rosen-
wald school, I grew up in rural Amer-
ica, rural Arkansas, and actually at-
tended a one-room school where one 
teacher, Ms. Beadie King, taught eight 
grades plus what we call the little 
primer and the big primer all by her-
self. 
In many of the rural towns where Af-
rican Americans lived during that 
time, there were no schools. If there 
were, they only went to the sixth grade 
and sometimes to the eighth grade. So 
the impact of these 5,300 schools that 
Julius Rosenwald helped to build—he 
was a friend of Booker Washington, and 
Booker Washington helped him under-
stand that it was great for people to 
get to Tuskegee, but there were thou-
sands of African Americans in these 
rural areas who never had a first grade, 
second grade, third grade to get to. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted that 
leadership put this bill on the calendar 
today. I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing. And as you can tell, I am very pas-
sionate about this bill. 
I also live in the area where the 
international headquarters for Sears, 
Roebuck and Company existed at that 
time. So the name ‘‘Julius Rosenwald’’ 
is an entity that our country should 
never, ever forget, and we ought to 
have as many ways of expressing it as 
we possibly can. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor and a privilege to be able to 
yield time to someone who I grew up in 
his district as his constituent. It is a 
great honor to be here and to hear 
more about, obviously, Sears, Roebuck 
and Company and an area that I grew 
up in and know very well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7460. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Jimmy Carter National Historic Site shall be

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GALLEGO) and the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5472, the Jimmy Carter National 
Historical Park Redesignation Act, in-
troduced by Representative SANFORD 
BISHOP from Georgia. 
Established by Congress in 1987, the 
Jimmy Carter National Historic Site 
and Preservation District protects and 
shares the stories of key sites associ-
ated with the life of President Jimmy 
Carter. 
Today, the site consists of President 
Carter’s boyhood farm; Plains High 
School, which the Carters attended; 
the Carter home and compound where 
the Carters currently live; and the 
Plains Railroad Depot, which served as 
Carter’s campaign headquarters during 
the 1976 Presidential campaign. 
H.R. 5472 would redesignate the Na-
tional Historic Site as the Jimmy Car-
ter National Historical Park to con-
form with the Park Service’s standard 
pattern of nomenclature and to help 
promote increased visitation to the 
area. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Representative BISHOP for his ef-
forts to elevate the life of Jimmy Car-
ter, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5472 redesig-
nates the Jimmy Carter National His-
toric Site as Jimmy Carter National 
Historical Park. This site includes 
President Carter’s resident and boy-
hood home. Plains High School serves 
as the site’s visitor center. And the 
railroad depot, which served as cam-
paign headquarters during the 1976 
Presidential election, and also houses 
additional exhibits. Redesignation of 
the site does not affect the laws or 
policies that govern the area, and the 
primary impact of the passage of this 
legislation would be changing signs, 
maps, and handouts. 
Redesignation of the Jimmy Carter 
National Historic Site as a national 
historical park does not affect the laws 
or policies that govern the area, and I 
urge adoption of this measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
5472, the Jimmy Carter National His-
torical Park Redesignation Act. 
The legislation would change the 
name of the Jimmy Carter National 
Historic Site in Plains, Georgia, to the 
Jimmy 
Carter 
National 
Historical 
Park, thereby ensuring that its nomen-
clature conforms to other noncontig-
uous sites within the National Park 
System. 
It would also honor the wishes of our 
Nation’s 39th President, who is a dear 
friend of mine, as well as my con-
stituent. 
On March 22, 2019, President Carter 
also became our Nation’s longest-living 
President, surpassing the lifespan of 
George H.W. Bush. In October, he cele-
brated his 96th birthday. 
As many of you are aware, President 
Carter has had a number of health 
challenges recently, which has created 
a sense of urgency around this legisla-
tion and the rich legacy that he and 
Mrs. Rosalynn Carter want to leave for 
their longtime home in Plains, Geor-
gia. 
After the Carters left the White 
House, the Carters and Plains commu-
nity took the initiative to preserve and 
protect the history of this small, rural, 
agricultural community. 
In 1987, Congress established the 
Jimmy Carter National Historic Site. 
As you have heard, it consists of the 
Plains Railroad Depot, which served as 
Jimmy Carter’s campaign headquarters 
during the 1976 Presidential campaign; 
Jimmy Carter’s boyhood farm; Plains 
High School, which the Carters both 
attended, and which now serves as the 
visitor center and museum; and the 
Carter home and compound, where the 
Carters currently live, which is now 
closed to the public. 
In fact, the Jimmy Carter National 
Historic Site is the only site in the Na-
tional Park System, aside from the 
White House, that is still an active 
Presidential home. I have taken my en-
tire staff there on a number of occa-
sions so that they could get a better 
feel and understanding of the values 
that shaped this great Georgian. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5472 enjoys the 
bipartisan support of the entire Geor-
gia congressional delegation, as well as 
the Plains community. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman GRIJALVA and Ranking Mem-
ber BISHOP on the full committee, and 
Chairwoman HAALAND
and Ranking 
Member YOUNG on the National Park 
Subcommittee. I thank Mr. GALLEGO 
and his able staff members, Brandon 
Bragato and Lily Wang, for all of their 
help in bringing this legislation to the 
House today under suspension of the 
rules. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary Committee, 
and a representative from the New South that 
President Jimmy Carter symbolized, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5472, the ‘‘Jimmy Car-
ter National Historical Park Redesignation 
Act,’’ bipartisan legislation that elevates the 
designation of the Jimmy Carter National His-
torical Site to accurately reflect its status in the 
National Park System and accord with a 
standard pattern of nomenclature. 
National historical parks are typically areas 
of greater physical extent and complexity than 
national historic sites; often they contain mul-
tiple discontiguous sites. 
According to the National Park Service, the 
Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, which was 
established by Congress in 1987, is comprised 
of facilities at several sites in and around the 
town of Plains, Georgia and has the character-
istics that make the designation of ‘‘national 
historical park’’ a more appropriate title than 
‘‘national historic site.’’ 
Congress passed the legislation in 1987 to 
preserve the key sites and structures associ-
ated with President Jimmy Carter during his 
life, provide for the interpretation of the life 
and presidency of Jimmy Carter, and present 
the history of a small rural southern town. 
The historic site consists of President 
Carter’s boyhood home in the community of 
Archery; Plains High School, now used for a 
visitor center and headquarters for the historic 
site; the Plains depot, which was used as a 
headquarters for Jimmy Carter’s presidential 
campaign; and the Carter compound, where 
President and Mrs. Carter have resided since 
1981. 
It is therefore fitting and proper that we pass 
this bipartisan legislation, supported unani-
mously by the Georgia congressional delega-
tion, designating this complex of historically 
significant places as the ‘‘Jimmy Carter Na-
tional Historical Park,’’ in honor of the 39th 
President of the United States, whose post- 
presidency is universally regarded as the 
greatest and most consequential in history. 
Madam Speaker, Jimmy Carter was little 
known outside the South before he became 
president and I vividly recall his acceptance 
speech in July 1976 at Madison Square Gar-
den in New York City, which he began by say-
ing simply: ‘‘My name is Jimmy Carter and I’m 
running for president.’’ 
It was at that convention that the great Con-
gresswoman Barbara Jordan, who held the 
seat I now hold, made history by being the 
first African American woman to give the key-
note address at a major political party nomi-
nating convention. 
Madam Speaker, it is perhaps a failing of all 
us that we do not acknowledge nearly enough 
the enormous achievements and contributions 
to our country of the Carter Administration. 
Let me list briefly some of the enormous 
positive changes wrought by President Carter, 
this most moral of public men was awarded 
the Medal of Freedom in addition to being the 
2002 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7251 
December 17, 2020 
During his administration, President Carter 
signed into law many legislative proposals that 
have changed our lives for the better and 
made living in America safer, more affordable, 
fairer, and better. 
For example, President Carter signed into 
law the Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liability Act, 
known as the Superfund Act (Pub. L. 96–510). 
The U.S. Department of Energy was created 
in 1977 with the enactment of Department of 
Energy Organization Act, signed into law as 
Pub. L. 95–91. 
The U.S. Department of Education was cre-
ated in 1979 with the enactment of Depart-
ment of Education Organization Act, signed 
into law as Pub. L. 96–88. 
Airline travel was deregulated, making it af-
fordable for millions of Americans to travel by 
air for the first time with the passage of the 
Airline Deregulation Act, Pub. L. 95–504. 
Under President Carter, both the trucking 
and rail industry were deregulated leading to 
reduced shipping costs and lower prices for 
consumers with the signing of the Motor Car-
rier Act, Pub. L. 96–296, and the Staggers 
Rail Act, Pub. L. 96–448. 
Madam Speaker, a little recalled fact is that 
under the Carter Administration, 9.8 million 
jobs were created, more than any president 
from Nixon until Clinton, thanks to economic 
legislation like the Humphrey-Hawkins Full 
Employment Act, signed into law as the Full 
Employment and Balanced Growth Act (Pub. 
L. 95–523) and Comprehensive Employment 
and Training Act Amendments (Pub. L. 95– 
524. 
A full listing of the important laws signed by 
President Carter would take more time than 
we have available but includes the Civil Serv-
ice Reform Act, Pub. L. 95–454, which created 
the Office of the Inspector General, and the 
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation 
Act, Pub. L. 96–487, which designated certain 
public lands in Alaska as units of the National 
Park, National Wildlife Refuge, Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers, National Wilderness Preservation 
and National Forest Systems, resulting in 
79.54 million acres of refuge land in Alaska, of 
which 27.47 million acres were designated as 
wilderness. 
President Carter was the first president to 
express to the nation the interrelation between 
national security and energy independence 
and to take action to enhance both, with the 
passage of the: 
1. National Energy Act, Pub. L. 95–617 
through 621, 
2. Emergency Natural Gas Act, Pub. L. 95– 
2, 
3. Reorganization Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95– 
17, 
4. Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act, Pub. L. 
96–223, and 
5. Energy Security Act, Pub. L. 96–294. 
Other major legislation signed into law by 
President Carter were the Depository Institu-
tions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, 
Pub. L. 96–221; the Trade Agreements Act, 
Pub. L. 96–39, and the Panama Canal Trea-
ties. 
In the areas of foreign affairs and national 
security, President Carter deescalated and 
normalized diplomatic relations with China, 
brokered the historic Camp David Accord be-
tween Israel and Egypt, and hastened the col-
lapse of the Soviet Union by supporting the 
mujahideen as it fought to repel and defeat 
the invading forces of the Soviet Union. 
President Carter proudly and firmly made 
promotion and protection of human rights a 
cornerstone of American foreign policy and 
made clear that the United States would not 
overlook or tolerate human rights abuses, 
whether committed by adversary or ally, which 
helped hasten the end of apartheid in South 
Africa and authoritarian governments in South 
and Latin America. 
President Carter appointed the first woman 
of color to a cabinet position when he chose 
the Hon. Patricia Roberts Harris as his Sec-
retary of Housing and Urban Development and 
then as Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices. 
It was President Carter who appointed Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg to the federal judiciary when 
he nominated her to be a judge of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit in 1980. 
It was President Carter who appointed Ste-
phen Breyer to the federal judiciary when he 
nominated him for a seat on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the First Circuit in 1980. 
In fact, when President Carter took office, 
just eight women had ever been appointed to 
one of the 500 federal judgeships in the coun-
try, he doubled that number and appointed 40 
women, including eight women and 33 men of 
color. 
President Carter changed the face of the 
federal judiciary to make it more representa-
tive of the American people and set the exam-
ple which Presidents Clinton and Obama fol-
lowed. 
After leaving office, President Carter em-
barked on an energetic and tireless post-presi-
dency, founding in 1982 the Carter Presi-
dential Center at Emory University in Atlanta, 
Georgia, which is devoted to issues relating to 
democracy and human rights. 
Most everyone has seen Jimmy and 
Rosalyn Carter working with Habitat for Hu-
manity International building housing and help-
ing underprivileged persons realize the dream 
of home ownership. 
President Carter has served as a freelance 
ambassador for a variety of international mis-
sions, including mediating disputes between 
countries, observing elections in nations with 
histories of fraudulent voting processes, and 
advising presidents on Middle East issues. 
He has also made time to be a prolific au-
thor, writing more than 30 books, including 
Keeping Faith: Memoirs of a President (1983), 
Turning Point (1992), and An Hour Before 
Daylight (2001). 
The United States and the world are better 
off because Jimmy Carter emerged from hum-
ble origins to become the 39th President of 
the United States. 
Not bad for a Georgia peanut farmer, An-
napolis graduate, and nuclear submariner, not 
bad at all. 
I strongly support this bipartisan legislation 
and urge all Members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R 5472, the ‘‘Jimmy Carter National 
Historical Park Redesignation Act.’’ 
God bless President Carter, and the United 
States of America.

question is on the motion offered by 
the

from 
Arizona 
(Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7252 
December 17, 2020 
I rise in support of H.R. 5852, the Weir 
Farm National Historical Park Redes-
ignation Act, introduced by Represent-
ative JIM HIMES. 
In 1882, American artist Julian Alden 
Weir traded a still life painting he had 
acquired in Europe for a 153-acre farm 
in Branchville, Connecticut. Inspired 
by the farm’s rural setting, Weir spent 
the next 36 years developing a new ap-
proach 
to 
landscape 
painting 
and 
gained a reputation as a leader of the 
American Impressionists. 
In 1990, Congress established the Weir 
Farm National Historic Site to pre-
serve the structures and rural land-
scape that inspired Weir’s transition 
into American Impressionism. Today, 
the 68-acre site includes more than a 
dozen structures, as well as historic 
gardens, orchards, fields, and hundreds 
of historic painting sites. The National 
Historic Site also maintains a museum 
collection containing more than 200,000 
archives and objects, including original 
paintings, sculptures, and prints. 
H.R. 5852 would redesignate the Weir 
Farm National Historic Site as the 
Weir Farm National Historical Park to 
conform with the National Park Serv-
ice’s standard pattern of nomenclature 
and to help promote increased visita-
tion to the area. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 5852 would redesignate Weir 
Farm National Historic Site in Con-
necticut as a National Historical Park. 
This 68-acre historic site is the only 
National Park System unit dedicated 
to American painting and was estab-
lished as a unit of the system in 1990. It 
preserves 
the 
home, 
studio, 
and 
grounds of American artist Julian 
Alden Weir. 
Weir spent nearly four decades paint-
ing, and his artist friends Childe 
Hassam, 
John 
Twachtman, 
Emil 
Carlsen, John Singer Sargent, and Al-
bert Pinkham Ryder often joined him 
there. Together, they created master-
pieces of light and color on canvas that 
came 
to 
define 
American 
Impres-
sionism. 
Following his death, Weir’s daughter, 
Dorothy Weir Young, an artist in her 
own right, and her sculptor husband 
carried on the artistic legacy at the 
farm. They were followed by New Eng-
land painters Sperry and Doris An-
drews. 
Madam Speaker, redesignation of 
Weir Farm as a national historic park 
does not affect the laws or policies that 
govern the area. I urge adoption of this 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Mr. GALLEGO, for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 5852. 
Weir Farm is a magnificent jewel 
that resides in the middle of my dis-
trict. 
I should say at the outset, my dis-
trict is actually smaller than a great 
number of the national park assets in 
this country, and so much of the agri-
culture 
that 
used 
to 
characterize 
southwestern Connecticut, of course, 
has given way to urban environments 
and to suburban environments. As a 
consequence, this 70 acres of land is 
truly a jewel inside Connecticut’s 
Fourth District and inside Fairfield 
County, Connecticut. 
The Weir Farm National Historic 
Site stretches across just 70 acres of 
land, but in those 70 acres, there are 
any number of historical buildings, a 
vast collection of American art, or-
chards and landscapes, trails, gardens, 
miles of stone walls, and Weir Pond, as 
well as over 250 historic painting sites. 
Sometimes people don’t remember— 
though I appreciate my colleagues 
today reminding everyone—that south-
western Connecticut has a long tradi-
tion of the production of American art, 
including Childe Hassam, who resided 
in my own town of Cos Cob, Con-
necticut. 
But this particular national histor-
ical site, soon to become a national 
historical park, offers an opportunity, 
in particular, to the children who live 
in Stamford, Connecticut; Norwalk, 
Connecticut; 
and 
Bridgeport, 
Con-
necticut, cities that actually do have 
some meaningful poverty and in which 
children don’t have a lot of opportuni-
ties to come face-to-face with their his-
tory, face-to-face with art, and face-to- 
face with our agricultural heritage, to 
actually see and touch these things. 
It is a really wonderful location in 
the middle of Fairfield County, Con-
necticut, and this redesignation will 
capture the full breadth and the full 
comprehensive set of offerings that the 
Weir Farm National Historical Park 
will continue to offer the people of 
Connecticut and, quite frankly, the 
people of the United States. 
The park’s designation today fails to 
represent everything that the farm of-
fers, including the remarkable youth 
programs that I referred to earlier, 
where organizations like Groundwork 
Bridgeport have partnered with Weir 
Farm to provide young people with op-
portunities that they might not other-
wise have. 
Before I close, Madam Speaker, I 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Chairwoman 
HAALAND, Chairman GRIJALVA of the 
subcommittee, 
Ranking 
Member 
BISHOP, and Representative YOUNG for 
working on this piece of legislation. 
I thank the Friends of Weir Farm, in-
cluding Elizabeth Castagna and Judy 
Wander, who have pushed this very 
hard, and the hardworking men and 
women at Weir Farm, including Linda 
Cook, the superintendent. 
Finally, I thank my colleague, Sen-
ator MURPHY, who will be seeing that 
this bill moves expeditiously through 
the United States Senate. 
I also thank, again, my friend, Mr. 
GALLEGO. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5852. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

STAND UP FOR AMERICANS WHO 
ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE THE 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thought about every day I would rise 
to emphasize the number of Americans 
who have died in the last 24 hours be-
cause of COVID–19, some 3,000-plus; 
300,000 Americans have already died, a 
half a million are expected to lose their 
life by the beginning of the year. 
It is crucial that we, without ceasing, 
pass a COVID–19 package that includes 
a lifeline for families that are trying to 
survive: cash payment; unemployment; 
more money for vaccines; more testing; 
more money to stop evictions; more 
money 
for 
small 
businesses, 
res-
taurants, and our transportation com-
munity. 
But more importantly, children are 
losing parents. And the holiday season 
is coming, and many are not even 
thinking about another surge like we 
had from Thanksgiving. 
Madam Speaker, I beg of America to 
prayerfully commemorate, celebrate, 
love this holiday season, but it should 
be a skinny season to save lives. 
Save lives. 
And we must pass a COVID–19 pack-
age, not leave until we get it done. 
Americans are dying, and that means 
that we have to stand up, and stand up 
for them, and I am here on the floor to 
stand up for them. 
f 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SHERRILL). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I would 
hope that anyone who has ever had the 
privilege to serve as a Member of Con-
gress leaves this place with a heart full 
of gratitude. After 32 years as a Mem-
ber of this body, I certainly feel that 
way. 
It is hard to believe that I have been 
elected for 16 terms, 32 years. I came 
here at age 41, not knowing exactly 
what to expect, and I have learned a 
great deal in these 32 years. 
I send gratitude, first and foremost, 
to the people of the 16th District of 
New York for sending me here 16 times. 
It has been an honor to have your trust 
and to be your voice here in the House. 
Gratitude to thousands of people: the 
Capitol Police; the Sergeant at Arms; 
the Congressional Research Service; 
the Architect of the Capitol; the Office 
of the Attending Physician, Dr. Brian 
Monahan; and so many others. It takes

a small army to keep Congress run-
ning, and you seldom get the recogni-
tion you have earned. 
Gratitude to my staff over the years, 
and let me acknowledge a few who have 
been with me for a long while: the staff 
director on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, Jason Steinbaum; my chief of 
staff, Bill Weitz; and my administra-
tive assistant here in Washington, Ned 
Michalek. 
Madam Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD a full roster of my staff in the 
office of the 16th District and on the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, with my 
profound 
thanks. 
And, 
of 
course, 
Madam Speaker, I send gratitude to 
my fellow Representatives. 
When I came here, I never could have 
imagined that I would get to be chair-
man of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. It is a committee that I fol-
lowed for many years. It is a com-
mittee that I have always thought was 
prestigious. It is a committee that I 
thought was very important, and to be 
on that committee was a wonder for 
me, but to be the chair of that com-
mittee is just unbelievable. 
I especially want to thank the mem-
bers of the New York delegation, past 
and present. We are a group as richly 
diverse as the great State we come 
from. I am proud of the way we have 
stood together and stood up for New 
Yorkers, particularly in times of crisis 
and tragedy: the pandemic we are en-
during now; Superstorm Sandy; the 
Great Recession; and, of course, in the 
aftermath of the attacks of September 
11, 2001. 
I am grateful to our leadership on 
both sides, and it has been a unique 
honor to serve alongside our distin-
guished Speaker, Ms. PELOSI from Cali-
fornia. I have served alongside her for 
the entire length of my time in the 
House, and let me tell you—let me tell 
everybody—she is certainly one of a 
kind. I am privileged to call her my 
friend. 
We work very hard here, and some-
times we are so busy working, we don’t 
get to know some of our fellow Con-
gress Members, particularly those on 
the other side of the aisle. As people 
are coming up to me and wishing me 
the best as I leave Congress, it is peo-
ple from both parties who are doing it. 
My Republican colleagues are doing it 
and my Democratic colleagues as well, 
wishing me the best. It has been just 
an honor to serve with them. 
We have to get to know each other 
better. I think we have lost some of 
that. 
If you have a colleague and you don’t 
serve on their committee and you are 
not from their State and you are from 
the opposite political party, you don’t 
really get to know them. That is a 
shame, because I have learned that we 
have so much talent on both sides of 
the aisle, people who are coming up to 
me and wishing me well, Republicans 
as well as Democrats, and that is really 
the way it should be. 
Again, if you don’t see somebody in 
the gym, if you don’t travel with them 
to some countries on the other side of 
the globe, if you don’t have much 
interaction with them, you won’t get 
to know them, and that is one thing I 
hope changes, and changes soon. 
People have been stopping me here 
and wishing me well upon my retire-
ment from Congress, and many, again, 
are from the other party, and I want to 
thank them, because it means a lot to 
me. 
I have tried to be bipartisan, not giv-
ing up what I believe and not pulling 
back from what I feel, but being bipar-
tisan in that you can respect each 
other even if you don’t agree on some 
of the issues. 
We are all here trying to do the same 
thing. We are all here trying to bring 
things home to our districts. We are 
here because we love America, and we 
are here because we are here with peo-
ple who also love America. 
My greatest honor here has been to 
serve during this Congress as the chair-
man of the House Committee on For-
eign Affairs. 
b 1715 
When I was sworn in for my first 
term back in 1989, the then-majority 
leader, who soon became Speaker, Tom 
Foley of Washington State, asked me 
my top three choices for committee as-
signments. I had to write it down, one, 
two, and three. For one, I wrote foreign 
affairs. For two, I wrote foreign affairs. 
And for three, I wrote foreign affairs. 
I did it because I wanted to empha-
size the fact that I had hoped to be on 
the committee, even though people 
asked me: Why do you want to be on 
foreign affairs? 
It is not a committee that is back 
home. It is not something that you can 
meet people on. It is foreign affairs. It 
is all over the world. 
I haven’t regretted being a member 
of the committee and being the chair-
man of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs for one day. To me, what is going 
on in the world, what is going on in the 
world now, what went on in the world 
before, what is going on in the world in 
the future is so important, and this 
Congress needs to be engaged and this 
Congress needs to be very much listen-
ing to what is going on, and help move 
this country to the direction that we 
all know the United States can do. 
I said foreign affairs because, you 
know, since I was a kid, growing up in 
Bronx, New York, in public housing, 
since that time, I have been fascinated 
with America’s leadership role in the 
world. 
All four of my grandparents were 
Jewish immigrants from what is now 
Ukraine, who fled the pogroms of the 
early 20th century, looking for safe 
haven and opportunity. And guess 
what? They found it in America. They 
came here before World War I. If they 
hadn’t come here, they almost cer-
tainly would have perished in the Holo-
caust. 
This country has been a refuge to 
people who are hurting for many, many 
years, and I am grateful for it. 
As a child of the Cold War, I remem-
ber learning about America as a beacon 
of freedom and democracy, standing 
opposed to an oppressive, totalitarian 
ideology. My entire life has been an 
education in what a force for good 
America can be when we are at our 
best, in the American values that sup-
port human rights and human dignity, 
and America’s character of compassion 
and generosity. 
So, of course, as a public servant, I 
wanted to leave my mark on the way 
the United States conducts itself on 
the global stage. There are a few areas 
where I like to think I made a dif-
ference. 
I have always had a special place in 
my heart for the Balkans and, in par-
ticular, a country called Kosovo. There 
are many Kosovar Albanians in New 
York, and that is how I first got to 
know the community. A good friend of 
mine, Harry Bajraktari, is the one who 
introduced me to the community, and 
we have been doing work with the com-
munity and with the country of Kosovo 
ever since. 
I strongly supported the Clinton ad-
ministration’s intervention in the Bal-
kans in 1999. We stopped genocide from 
happening again in Europe by doing 
that. That was NATO at its best, that 
was America at its best, stopping geno-
cide. A million people were being 
thrown out of Kosovo, and we stopped 
it. That was one of my proudest mo-
ments as a Member of Congress. 
I remember talking with President 
Clinton and saying, We have got to 
help these people; we have got to help 
these people. 
And we did. We know in hindsight 
that it stopped a genocide. And since 
then, I have been a champion for 
Kosovo’s sovereignty and independ-
ence. That country has made tremen-
dous strides and is recognized by the 
United States, the UK, France, Ger-
many, Japan, and so many other im-
portant nations. 
The people there are very, very pro- 
American; and when you go there as an 
American, you can’t help but feel how 
much they love this country and how 
grateful they are that we helped them 
with their independence. 
I have been honored by that country 
to have had a highway and a road 
named after me. And they even put me 
on a postage stamp. I was joking with 
my wife. I said, You know, it is not a 
cheap postage stamp they put me on. It 
is a 2 pound postage stamp—two euro, 
I should say, a two euro postage stamp. 
What an honor for me. 
I served for a time as chairman and 
ranking member of the Western Hemi-
sphere, Civilian Security, and Trade 
Subcommittee, and I have always 
pushed for a foreign policy that focuses 
on prioritizing what is going on in our 
own neighborhood. 
One of the last bills President Obama 
signed into law was my bill, the West-
ern Hemisphere Drug Policy Commis-
sion Act, which required our govern-
ment to take stock of what has worked

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7255 
December 17, 2020 
and what has failed in our drug policy 
over the last few decades. The commis-
sion recently submitted its report to 
Congress with recommendations that I 
hope will improve U.S. drug policy and 
save lives. 
I have also been a strong advocate for 
closer ties to our Caribbean neighbors. 
I wrote the United States-Caribbean 
Strategic Engagement Act to push for 
a new strategy to engage Caribbean 
countries that seek out the expertise of 
the vibrant Caribbean diaspora living 
right here in the United States. 
And when the Trump administration 
cut off assistance to Central America, I 
was proud to lead a bipartisan effort to 
restore those resources that are help-
ing to reduce crime and violence and 
root out corruption. 
Thanks to my partner and friend, MI-
CHAEL MCCAUL of Texas, who was right 
there on the trip with me, right by my 
side fighting with me, fighting with me 
for what is right. Michael is a Repub-
lican from Texas. I am a Democrat 
from New York. We have become real-
ly, really good friends, and I wish there 
would be more of that in Congress. 
When you get to know someone, again, 
in the other party, and you don’t serve 
on a committee with them, but then 
you get to know them, you see how 
marvelous they are. We have such good 
people here from all over the country 
doing their best, working hard and rep-
resenting their districts well, and Mi-
chael is certainly in that league. 
So I was proud to lead a bipartisan 
effort to restore those resources that 
are helping to reduce crime and vio-
lence and to root out corruption. 
I have also long focused on American 
policy toward Syria. In 2003, I wrote 
the Syria Accountability and Lebanese 
Sovereignty Restoration Act, which 
helped end the Syrian occupation of 
Lebanon. It pushed the Syrians out of 
Lebanon. 
In 2012, I sponsored the first bill to 
arm the Free Syrian Army in its fight 
against the Assad regime. And just a 
year ago, my legislation, the Caesar 
Syria Civilian Protection Act, finally 
became law, providing the toughest 
sanctions to date on Assad, who has 
killed 
so 
many 
people, 
and 
his 
enablers. 
I encourage the incoming Biden ad-
ministration to take full advantage of 
these tools, dial up pressure on the re-
gime, and try to stop the violence. 
I said at the start of my time here, 
when I spoke to some people back 
home, that Israel would not have a bet-
ter friend in Congress than ELIOT 
ENGEL. And no matter where you stand 
on U.S. policy toward Israel, it would 
be tough to argue that I haven’t lived 
up to that commitment. I have been 
proud to stand with our ally, Israel, 
our closest friend in the Middle East 
and, I would argue, in the world, 
throughout my career. 
I believe that the United States and 
Israel share an incredibly important 
partnership, and the cornerstone of 
this relationship is the support it re-
ceives from both sides of the aisle. Con-
gress should continue to give this part-
nership its full support in the future. 
No one should play partisan politics 
with 
America’s 
relationship 
with 
Israel. 
The 
Constitution 
gives 
Congress 
broad oversight authority to make sure 
the executive branch is serving the 
American people. As chairman, I have 
worked hard to demand accountability 
from the administration. It hasn’t al-
ways been easy, but during this Con-
gress, the committee has succeeded in 
shining a light on some pretty trou-
bling developments at the State De-
partment. 
It is important that this work con-
tinue into the next Congress, even as 
the Trump administration ends and 
President-elect 
Biden 
takes 
office. 
After all, we don’t conduct oversight 
just for the sake of conducting over-
sight. It shouldn’t be used as a political 
tool. If existing laws and regulations 
aren’t up to the task of preventing 
abuses and mismanagement, then we 
need to remedy these weaknesses. It is 
up to Congress to bend back the crook-
ed branch. 
I am confident that my successor, my 
friend from New York City, just like 
me, GREGORY MEEKS, will carry the 
committee’s work forward with dis-
tinction. I am glad that he is replacing 
me as chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and I know that he will do 
a wonderful job. 
It is on that point, the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee’s work, that I take the 
most pride. I have said for a long time 
that the Foreign Affairs Committee is 
the most bipartisan committee in Con-
gress. Even at a time when our politics 
are so polarized, the members of our 
committee have worked together to ad-
vance American interests, values, and 
leadership around the world. 
We don’t always agree. We have had 
heated debates in this Chamber over 
war powers, weapons sales, and more. 
But when we debate, we debate on the 
merits of the policy. Then we cast our 
votes. Immediately after, we get back 
to working together toward policies 
that leave politics at the water’s edge. 
We have always said that the Foreign 
Affairs Committee is the most bipar-
tisan committee in Congress, and it is. 
We have always said that politics 
should stop at the water’s edge when 
Members of Congress are leaving our 
country and going to other countries 
because when we are there, Democrats 
and Republicans, traveling together, 
we represent the United States of 
America, and so partisanship should 
stop at the water’s edge. We have 
worked very hard to do that. 
MICHAEL
MCCAUL
has worked very 
hard to do that, and I wish that we 
would have more of that in Congress, 
realizing that we are all representing 
our districts back home, our districts 
and constituencies are different, and 
we are all trying to do the best we can. 
And I respect my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle who work hard. Peo-
ple coming up to me and wishing me 
congratulations come from both par-
ties, and for that I am deeply, deeply 
grateful. 
So as I said, we don’t always agree. 
We have had heated debates in this 
Chamber over war powers, weapons 
sales, and more. But when we debate, 
we debate on the merits of the policy. 
Then we cast our votes. Immediately 
after, we get back to working together 
towards policies that leaves politics at 
the water’s edge. That has always been 
the culture of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
As I said before, I am grateful to my 
partner in maintaining that tradition, 
our ranking member, my friend from 
Texas, MICHAEL MCCAUL. We have be-
come 
good 
friends. 
We 
have 
rep-
resented our country together overseas 
and we have wrapped up a lot of legis-
lative victories. I certainly will miss 
working with him. 
You know, Members generally don’t 
get to know each other. I said it before, 
if you are not on the same committee 
as someone, you will not know that 
person. If that person is not from your 
State, you probably won’t know that 
person. And if you haven’t traveled 
with that American, or done other 
things, you won’t know that person. 
We have got to change that. We have 
got to know each other. We have got to 
work with each other. We have got to 
accept each other. We are all here be-
cause we love the United States of 
America. 
So with so much left on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee to do, I know GREG-
ORY MEEKS will do a fine job of leading 
the committee. In the 117th Congress, I 
hope the Foreign Affairs Committee 
continues to take on these challenges. 
Congress needs to reclaim its authority 
in foreign policy that has been chipped 
away year after year, in deference to 
the executive branch, no matter who is 
in the executive branch. 
We need to make the State Depart-
ment authorization act a regular part 
of Congress’ work. And Congress needs 
to reassert its authority over war pow-
ers. I am confident that the committee 
can do big things, that Congress still 
has the capacity to do big things, to 
govern. 
We are here to govern. We come to 
Washington from 441 different commu-
nities, each with its unique character 
and concerns and priorities. That is 441 
elected officials whose job it is to stand 
up for our constituents to make their 
voices heard. But we cannot lose sight 
of the fact that the House of Rep-
resentatives—not 441 individuals, but 
the body we constitute—has a responsi-
bility to govern. 
When I came here 32 years ago, the 
two parties looked very different from 
the way they look now: Southern 
Democrats 
and 
Rockefeller 
Repub-
licans. 
The 
diffusion 
of 
political 
ideologies across the aisle made it nec-
essary for the two sides to seek out 
compromise if the House was going to 
get its work done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7256 
December 17, 2020 
b 1730 
As the parties have realigned over 
the years, it has become harder and 
harder for the House to advance any-
thing that stands a chance at becoming 
law except noncontroversial measures 
or must-pass legislation like the de-
fense authorization and spending bills. 
Frankly, again, as I said, it has be-
come harder and harder just to get to 
know one another. I am a pretty pro-
gressive Democrat by most measures, 
but I always thought it was important 
to cultivate relationships with my Re-
publican colleagues. We need to try to 
build cross-party bonds. We need to 
work together with all Members of the 
House. 
I may disagree with someone on 95 
percent of policy questions, but if you 
don’t know a person, Mr. Speaker, then 
you don’t stand a chance of finding the 
5 percent in common and trying to 
build on it. If you don’t know a person, 
Mr. Speaker, it is so much easier to 
dismiss his or her motives, and that is 
really where things start to fall apart. 
No Member of this body doesn’t love 
America. We share wildly different vi-
sions of the best way for America to 
meet its full potential, of the best way 
to improve the lives of the American 
people, but we all love our country. 
And I worry that more and more Mem-
bers are mired in mistrust on the other 
side or saddled with purity tests, mak-
ing it difficult to build relationships 
and seek common ground. 
We have to resist the urge to let the 
perfect be the enemy of the good. This 
doesn’t mean abandoning our prin-
ciples or losing sight of our goals. It 
means acknowledging the progress in 
our political system takes time and 
perseverance. It means understanding 
that, as convinced as I might be that 
my view is the correct one, a big chunk 
of this body and of this country is like-
ly to disagree. It means taking wins 
where we can get them, even if they 
are modest. Because when we accom-
plish even a little bit of good here, we 
haven’t done so in service of an idea or 
our party. We have done it for the 
American people. That is what it 
means to govern, and we are here to 
govern. 
For example, I am a proud member of 
the Medicare for All Caucus. Going all 
the way back to my time in the State 
house in Albany, I have supported sin-
gle-payer healthcare. I hope to see 
Medicare for All in my lifetime. But 
that hasn’t stopped me, over the last 
three decades, from voting for legisla-
tion that I thought would move the 
needle in the right direction. 
I was never under the illusion that 
we would get there with one swing. But 
we did get the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program, and we did get the Af-
fordable Care Act, which has made a 
difference in the lives of millions of 
Americans. It was real progress, which 
we are defending even today. 
It was also more than a decade ago, 
and our country still faces massive 
challenges when it comes to healthcare 
and a range of other issues. We owe it 
to the American people to try to gov-
ern, to try to work together, not to re-
flexively reject what the other side 
says, not root our entire agenda in try-
ing to make political gains in the next 
election, 
not 
to 
ignore 
facts 
and 
science and reality because political al-
legiances demand it. 
And, yes, that means acknowledging 
the results of last month’s election and 
supporting the smooth transfer of 
power next month when President- 
elect Biden takes office as President of 
the United States. 
The 
Constitution 
has 
given 
the 
American people this body, the House 
of Representatives. In turn, the House 
has given our country the 13th Amend-
ment, suffrage for women, Social Secu-
rity and Medicare, the Civil Rights 
Act, and the Voting Rights Act. They 
weren’t easy victories, but if our prede-
cessors in Congress hadn’t tried, then 
they would never have been victories 
at all. 
As we enter the dark winter of this 
pandemic, we know there is light at 
the end of the tunnel. Today in the 
United Kingdom and soon the United 
States, the most vulnerable are being 
vaccinated against this deadly disease. 
That will soon happen here. But so 
much work remains before we can get 
back to normal. 
People are out of work, out of money, 
and out of food. The American people 
will look to this body to govern. I 
know in my heart that we can put the 
American people first and answer the 
call at this pivotal moment in our 
country’s history. 
The future success of the American 
people depends on the success of the 
House in meeting this challenge. So, I 
will be rooting for all of you. 
It has been a pleasure being your col-
league. It has been a pleasure working 
with you. It has been a pleasure watch-
ing how hard you work and what we do 
for the American people. Thank you for 
letting me be your colleague. Thank 
you for being so kind to me and my 
family. 
When my son, who is now 34, my mid-
dle child, came to the House when I 
was first elected, he was 2 years old. 
My daughter was 7, and my other son 
wasn’t born yet. He used to point to 
the Capitol, and he used to say: ‘‘Cap-
itol. Daddy works there.’’ We would all 
kind of laugh and think he was really, 
really cute. Well, today, he is 34 years 
old, and my three children have grown 
up with Congress, with the House, and 
they know how much it means to me to 
be a Member of this House and how 
much it means to them to learn all the 
things that we have been doing for the 
past several years. 
I will never forget this place. I hope 
to come back and visit several times. I 
will never forget my colleagues and my 
friends. I will never forget that I am 
fortunate and we are fortunate to be 
Americans, to love this country, to 
help move the country to policies that 
we think are best for the country and 
for the world. 
So, I won’t be a Member here, but I 
certainly will continue to have many 
friends here and will watch and see 
what this Congress does. We have some 
tremendously talented people. 
Again, I want to thank the Speaker, 
NANCY
PELOSI; the majority leader, 
STENY HOYER; and others as well who 
really have helped me and have been 
part and parcel of what I have done. 
JIM CLYBURN, thank you as well. 
My colleagues, life is bittersweet, 
and there are happy and sad things 
that sometimes come together. I am 
happy because I have had the privilege 
of serving here. I am happy because I 
like to think that I have done good for 
people in this country. But I am sad to 
be leaving this body. 
To my colleagues, I will be watching 
you; I will be proud; I will see what 
goes on; and I will stand by the TV or 
any other place and say: These are my 
colleagues, and they are very, very 
good. They care. 
It has been an honor and a privilege 
to be a Member of Congress in the 
United States of America. I am so 
grateful to have had that privilege. 
Thank you to all my colleagues. Best 
wishes, and God bless America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

WARNING OF MARXISM IN 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
ROSE of New York). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 3, 
2019, the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, in ad-
dition to addressing the Chair, I also 
want to address any history or civics 
teachers dealing with America and 
make some requests to them tonight. 
In order to understand the current 
events and understand why I and some 
other people are so concerned about 
the outcome of this election, we must 
have a discussion of Marxism. 
All American schoolchildren should 
have an understanding of Marxism. To 
understand why over 30,000 American 
troops died in Korea, we must know a 
little bit about Marxism. To under-
stand why over 50,000 American troops 
died in the Vietnam war, we must 
know a little bit about Marxism. 
When I think of Marxism, I think of 
three things. I think of their hatred of 
God and hatred of religion. I think of 
Karl Marx’s thesis when he was back in 
college. It was in part titled ‘‘I Hate 
All Gods.’’ And, of course, I think when 
China bragged about getting rid of the 
last churches, so I always associate 
Marxism with the end of Christianity. 
Secondly, I associate Marxism with 
the elimination of the family as a so-
cial unit. As a matter of fact, the 
elimination of the family as a social 
unit was one of the original goals of 
Karl Marx. I believe he was already 
teaming up with Engels by that time.

December 17, 2020 
Finally, the desire to get rid of pri-
vate property—by ‘‘private property,’’ 
it means: Do individuals have the right 
to own their own house, to form their 
own business, to buy whatever they 
want? 
Those are the three things I think of 
when I think of Marxism. 
I hope all American children are fa-
miliar with Communist China, Soviet 
Russia, Cuba, Vietnam, and Cambodia. 
Once you learn about the horrible 
things that have happened to these 
people and the places, Mr. Speaker, I 
want you to think about a quote. 
Now, we spend a great deal on mili-
tary expenditures here, and we are 
going to wrap things up some time in 
the next week around here, spending 
more money, again, on troops, ships, 
and airplanes. But Nikita Khrushchev 
warned us—actually bragged about—we 
will take America without firing a 
shot. 
Now, think of that. Here we spent all 
this money on nuclear weapons, air-
planes, ships, troops, and tanks—some 
made in my district—but Nikita Khru-
shchev said: That is not how we are 
going to defeat you. We are going to 
defeat you internally. 
I would assume if they are going to 
defeat us, it is because we don’t under-
stand what Marxism is. 
Things that concern me right now is 
the elevation of Black Lives Matter. 
Two of the three founders of Black 
Lives Matter made no qualms about it: 
We are Marxists. 
To drive it home, on their website, 
which they took down when it became 
a little embarrassing going into the 
election: We disrupt the Western-pre-
scribed family. 
I recently ran into a woman in my 
district who complained that her chil-
dren were driven into debt because she 
and her husband worked hard and had a 
good middle-class family. She felt 
other parents who did not get married 
and did not form nuclear families were 
given preference as far as getting uni-
versity grants. Of course, they are 
given preferences as far as healthcare, 
as well. 
So, I think we should be concerned 
when we have a group that, as far as I 
can see, almost nobody has publicly 
disassociated themselves from that 
makes no bones about the fact that 
they are Marxists. 
It is one of the reasons why I am con-
cerned when I see one of my colleagues 
from California having a relationship 
of some sort with someone who was ap-
parently working for Marxist Com-
munist China. That is why I am scared 
when I see that the mayor of New 
York, our greatest city, gets elected 
after he apparently went on a honey-
moon to Cuba and apparently idealized 
something like Cuba. He didn’t go 
there because he thought it was a hor-
rible place. 
When we look at this, we have to say: 
Are we in danger? 
I think we are very much in danger 
when we look at those three things. 
Americans do not know what Marx-
ism is. Someday, I would like to have a 
museum to Marxism just as we have a 
museum to the Holocaust because all 
Americans should know about the tens 
of millions of people who died, the 
promises the Marxists made to those 
people, and how it worked out. 
I do think, as I said, that as young 
people are educated about what is 
going on in the world in the last 100 
years, they should learn about Marx-
ism and all the people who died and all 
the people whose freedoms have been 
taken away and realize that there are 
genuinely people out there who want to 
get rid of the old-fashioned nuclear 
family. 
I should interrupt myself for just one 
second here. The people who wrote on 
the website for Black Lives Matter de-
scribed it as a Western patriarchic 
family. The idea of having a mom and 
dad at home and a dad being part of a 
child growing up is not just an Amer-
ican or Western thing. It is an African 
thing, and it is an Asian thing. It has 
happened all the time, and it is a little 
bit of a slam on these other cultures to 
imply that they do not have an old- 
fashioned nuclear family in other cul-
tures as well. 
Nevertheless, when I look at that 
many people without firing a shot who 
apparently don’t have a big problem 
with Marxism, it does scare me. 
So, tonight, I will ask my colleagues 
to do what they can as they get out 
and about and as they give speeches to 
tell particularly young people what 
Marxism is. I hope all teachers of our 
young people educate them as to what 
type of government a lot of very power-
ful people around this world wish we 
had and how things worked out for 
other countries when they adopted 
that Marxism model. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

S7563 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2020 
No. 214 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our hearts are steadfast 
toward You. Lead us faithfully to the 
refuge of Your choosing, for You desire 
to give us a future and a hope. 
Today, give our Senators the power 
to do Your will as they realize more 
fully that they are servants of Heaven 
and stewards of Your mysteries. Lord, 
inspire them to seek Your best for our 
Nation, repeatedly requesting Your 
guidance and following Your leading. 
May they help people maximize possi-
bilities for Your glory. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent for 1 minute in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
we are getting, perhaps, close to a new 
Presidency. So there is a lot of talk 
about how the Senate might handle 
new Cabinet people. Democrats are al-
ways lecturing Republican Senators 
about approving future Biden Cabinet 
nominees, even if we don’t agree with 
them. 
Now, that is pretty darn rich. In 
other words, they are saying something 
like this: Don’t follow our example 
from the past four years. 
Or another way to put that is: Don’t 
treat Biden nominees to the Cabinet 
like we treated Trump nominees to the 
Cabinet. 
So they seem to want two sets of 
rules for Republican and Democratic 
Cabinet nominees, just like they want 
with judicial nominees. 
President Obama had six Cabinet 
Secretaries approved by the Senate on 
his Inauguration Day, without even 
needing a rollcall vote, so that Presi-
dent Obama could hit the ground run-
ning. 
President Trump had none by voice 
vote, and only two were approved by 
rollcall votes before the President took 
over. Trump Cabinet and sub-Cabinet 
nominees, even ones who had been eas-
ily confirmed in previous Republican 
administrations, faced obstruction and 
partisan ‘‘nay’’ votes. Many Democrat 
Senators who aspired to be President 
voted against virtually every single 
Trump nominee, no matter how well 
qualified. 
My position has always been that a 
President should have the ability to 
choose his own Cabinet people whom he 
gets along with and whom he gets 
along with on policy, provided, of 
course, that they are qualified and will 
follow the law. 
That is the way it should be. It is 
how I have approached nominees to 
date. But can Senate Republicans be 
sure that if we employ that standard, 
Democrats will play fair with the next 
Republican President? 
I don’t want retaliation for its own 
sake, but the threat of holding Demo-
cratic Senators to their own standards 
has been our only means of deterrence 
of obstruction. I want to hear from 
Democrats why we should not now 
adopt their standards and vote down 
nominees based on politics. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
ership time is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Charles Edward 
Atchley, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United 
States District Judge for the Eastern 
District of Tennessee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am 
sorry that the Senator from Iowa, who 
spoke before me, left the floor before I 
could get his attention. 
Senator GRASSLEY is my friend. We 
have served together for many years. 
We have worked on a lot of things to-
gether, and I bet we will in the future. 
I like working with him. He shoots 
from the hip and tells you exactly what 
he thinks. He has—I know this sounds 
a little vain—a midwestern approach to 
him that I like a lot. 
He just gave us a little reminder here 
about the difficulties that faced some

of the Trump nominees on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. I remember that. 
There were some that were delayed be-
cause of very basic things. They had 
not filed their financial disclosure 
forms and the ethics reports, which 
were expected of all Cabinet nominees. 
I don’t expect President-Elect Biden 
to cut any corners. I expect his nomi-
nees to follow the rules and the law, 
and I am hoping that they will have bi-
partisan support when it comes to the 
Senate. I want to give this President a 
chance to get off to a good, solid start, 
and he is going to need it. 
We are in the midst of this pandemic. 
The numbers that roll in every single 
day are frightening. Even in my home 
State 
of 
Illinois, 
where 
Governor 
Pritzker and Mayor Lightfoot and so 
many others have worked hard to es-
tablish standards of conduct that will 
keep people safe, we know that the 
numbers are just unacceptable in terms 
of infections and hospitalizations and, 
sadly, deaths as well. Over 300,000 
Americans have died. 
We want to make sure that President 
Biden and Vice President Harris have 
the team and the wherewithal and the 
resources to respond quickly when they 
take office on January 20. 
I hope my Republican friends will 
join me in that effort. They have every 
right to expect these nominees to an-
swer the very basic questions that are 
required, but I hope that they will also 
do their best to expedite that process 
so that those going into critical posi-
tions to keep our country safe from 
this pandemic are in place, as well as 
those who are going to serve our Na-
tion in critical capacities, whether it is 
Secretary of State or Attorney General 
or Department of Homeland Security. 
But I look forward to working with 
my friend from Iowa. I take heed of his 
warning that we will hold these nomi-
nees to the same standards as we held 
President Trump’s nominees. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Madam President, we are at the elev-
enth hour before a funding deadline 
where the budget of the United States 
is at stake. Tomorrow, the continuing 
resolution expires, and we are facing 
the prospect of another continuing res-
olution. I pray that we don’t do that. 
This has been a very disappointing 
year for the Appropriations process. 
Historically, the process begins with 
the President’s budget, and then comes 
a budget resolution passed by the 
House and the Senate for the spending 
priorities in the next fiscal year. We 
didn’t do that. 
Then there is an allocation, usually, 
after the passage of a budget resolution 
of how much each subcommittee of the 
Appropriations Committee can work 
with, the total amounts of dollars. We 
didn’t do that. 
Then the subcommittees have hear-
ings, and some of these subcommittees 
of Appropriations have many hearings, 
to explore whether the dollar amounts 
that are allocated for a certain purpose 
really are well spent and serve their 
purpose. We didn’t do that. 
Then the subcommittee is supposed 
to meet and vote out an appropriations 
bill at the end of that process, report-
ing it to the full committee. And we 
didn’t do that. 
Then the Appropriations Committee 
is supposed to take up the subcommit-
tee’s product, debate it, subject to 
amendment, and pass it out for a con-
sideration by the full body. We never 
did that as well. 
The matter is supposed to come to 
the floor of the Senate, be debated, as 
well, perhaps amended, and pass the 
Senate, if it has the right, the nec-
essary votes. We didn’t do that. 
Then it is supposed to go to the 
House of Representatives to see how it 
matches up with their similar work 
product. We didn’t do that either. 
Ultimately, it may result in a con-
ference report, according to the rules, 
between the House and the Senate, and 
that never happened. 
So the entire budget appropriations 
process was completely avoided, and we 
find ourselves extending a continuing 
resolution for the spending of the U.S. 
Government for weeks at a time until 
after the election. 
So now we face the prospect, at the 
eleventh hour, of a decision to finish 
the work we were elected to do or to 
simply delay the situation again. 
Well, we need to do our job, and we 
need to do it now. We need to pass our 
annual appropriations bills to keep the 
government running. I cannot imagine 
the 
unforgivable 
and 
embarrassing 
tragedy it would be if the government 
is shut down for our failure to reach a 
decision. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, we need to pass a 
COVID relief bill. 
I was happy to join a group of 10 Sen-
ators—5 
Democrats 
and 
5 
Repub-
licans—3 weeks ago. We met for dinner 
one night—safe social distancing—in 
one of the Member’s houses and spent 
several hours talking about our frus-
tration that we hadn’t passed a COVID 
relief bill since March, when we passed 
the CARES Act. And we know that 
things have gotten worse in this coun-
try, not only with the pandemic but 
also with the state of the economy. For 
some reason, we just couldn’t reach an 
agreement—the two parties. 
Well, this mixed group of Senators of 
both political parties had a bold idea: 
Let’s try to do it ourselves. So we sat 
down, and in the course of 3 weeks, I 
cannot tell you how many hours we 
spent on the phone—zoom calls, other 
conference calls, and calls were even 
taking place on Thanksgiving Day— 
talking about what a COVID relief bill 
might look like. Some of the items we 
debated long and hard. Most of them 
we agreed on. 
This last Tuesday, this week, we re-
ported our bill to the U.S. Senate, to 
the floor of the Senate, and to the lead-
ers. And we didn’t just give them a 
memo with concepts. We gave them an 
actual bill that could be introduced 
today. 
The bill itself is significant in that it 
has $748 billion in spending. 
The areas of spending are fairly pre-
dictable: extending unemployment in-
surance benefits with a $300-a-week 
Federal supplement; $300 billion for 
business loans for those that are strug-
gling to survive; an additional $13 bil-
lion for the food stamp program, now 
known as SNAP, so that people who are 
relying on that, perhaps in the midst of 
unemployment, will have enough to 
eat; $13 billion for our farmers; $25 bil-
lion for emergency rental assistance to 
avoid evictions; $34 billion to hospitals 
and clinics for help as well, with a por-
tion of that set aside for rural hos-
pitals; $16 billion for testing and trac-
ing and the logistics of delivering the 
vaccine across America; $12 billion for 
a CDFI project for minority businesses. 
There is $5 billion for additional help 
with mental health counseling, and we 
know that this pandemic and the econ-
omy have taken their toll on the men-
tal health of America. 
There is $82 billion for education, $20 
billion of that for higher education, 
school districts and schools—univer-
sities too. They have to spend a lot of 
money because of COVID–19, and we 
want to help them get back on their 
feet. 
There is $10 billion for childcare, a 
critical element for many families. If 
they can’t find childcare, many people 
can’t go back to work. We want to give 
them help. 
There is $10 billion for broadband. 
Expanding broadband became critically 
important when kids relied on it to 
continue their education on remote 
learning. 
There is $45 billion for transpor-
tation, everything from the airline in-
dustry to Amtrak, to transit, to buses. 
They have all been hit hard, and we 
need them to come back with our econ-
omy. 
There is $10 billion for our Postal 
Service, and, boy, have they worked 
hard during this pandemic to keep up 
with the demands. 
And there are extensions of opportu-
nities to use CARES money into the 
next fiscal year—the next calendar 
year, I should say. 
There were more. We reached agree-
ment on all of these and came up with 
a bill that we presented to the leader-
ship of both the House and the Senate, 
both parties. The good news is they 
didn’t ignore it; they embraced it and 
started their own negotiations at the 
very highest levels of leadership in the 
Congress. 
Fingers crossed, we may come up 
with a bill today, a COVID relief bill. 
So from the time of our press con-
ference on Tuesday to the delivery of a 
product as soon as today is an amazing 
accomplishment when you consider all 
the time that we have spent waiting in 
hopes that we could find that solution. 
We have made significant progress. 
Funding the government is basic to our 
work in Congress, and this COVID re-
lief bill is essential as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7565 
December 17, 2020 
Now, I am disappointed in our work 
product. There is pride and disappoint-
ment. The disappointment is the fact 
that we didn’t reach an agreement on 
State and local government assistance. 
I favor that strongly, and I hope we 
turn to that issue as soon as we return 
in January. 
Also, there was a question of liability 
and 
lawsuits 
during 
the 
time 
of 
COVID–19. We offered several alter-
natives. The Republicans countered 
with theirs. We never had a meeting of 
the minds on that issue. I hope that we 
do return to it at some point soon. 
We need to put government spending 
on a course that makes sense for the 
next year that we are going to be tack-
ling as soon as January. From the mili-
tary and the FBI, public housing and 
transportation, to medical research 
and cybersecurity, in any way that we 
approach it, governing by CR is the 
worst possible way to do business. 
Continuing resolutions impede our 
government’s ability to operate effi-
ciently and, frankly, waste money. 
Taxpayers deserve better. The con-
tinuing resolution would leave us oper-
ating under funding levels before we 
faced this national emergency, which 
affects every part of America today. 
It would restrict agencies from shift-
ing dollars around to meet the chal-
lenges, and it would hurt their ability 
to plan ahead, hire and train new em-
ployees, start new projects. 
Continuing resolutions cause delays 
in contracts and grants when we need 
them the most. There are many exam-
ples of these, such as funding for med-
ical research. I don’t think there is an 
American alive today who doesn’t 
value medical research today more 
than they did a year ago. 
The Warp Speed project appears to be 
a dramatic success. I pray that it will 
be. Although I have been a frequent 
critic of this administration, I want to 
give them credit for organizing this ef-
fectively and delivering a vaccine in a 
timely way—an almost amazing timely 
way—in this pandemic that we face. I 
thank all who were involved in it, espe-
cially the scientists and researchers 
who didn’t give up until they found 
these vaccines. 
We know that FEMA would be pro-
hibited from awarding Homeland Secu-
rity grants to State and local govern-
ments unless we do our business of 
passing a budget. Safety and efficiency 
improvements in our transportation 
programs, such as bridge repairs, need 
to be timely and implemented. States 
and cities would not receive their com-
munity 
development 
block 
grants, 
which they desperately need. The list 
goes on and on. 
Our constituents elected us to do a 
job, and part of that job is to create a 
budget for this government. Months of 
bipartisan committee work and weeks 
of bipartisan negotiations should not 
be cast aside. I am hopeful that we will 
finalize a deal today and vote on it as 
early as today or tomorrow at the lat-
est. 
We can’t expect people to wait with 
any patience. We have waited too long 
ourselves. 
CYBER SECURITY 
Madam President, let me close on a 
topic that is related to this. The press 
reports of Russian hacking into the se-
curity systems of the United States are 
as troubling as can be. This is nothing 
short of a virtual invasion by the Rus-
sians into critical accounts of our Fed-
eral Government. 
It is possible that they have com-
promised some of the most important 
and sensitive information that this 
government owns, information that we 
rely on to keep America safe. Of 
course, Vladimir Putin denies it, but 
we know better. It is not the first time, 
but I hope it is one of the last times. 
We need to make it clear to Mr. 
Putin, to China, to Iran, to North 
Korea, and to any nation that would 
compromise and breach our security 
that there is a price to pay. No, I am 
not calling for an invasion myself or 
all-out war. I don’t want to see that 
happen, but it is no longer a buddy- 
buddy arrangement between the United 
States and Vladimir Putin. We have to 
take this man very seriously because 
he is a serious threat to the United 
States when he captures this kind of 
information, which we use so that our 
troops are safe in the field and we are 
safe in our homes. 
We thought we had a defense mecha-
nism established. It turns out that it 
failed and compromised the integrity 
of our security in the cyber world. We 
need to do better and, through the De-
partment of Homeland Security and 
the Department of Defense, dedicate 
the resources and say to Mr. Putin and 
others like him around the world: We 
are not going to stand by and let you 
take advantage of us. There will be a 
price to pay for this. 
Frankly, if we do anything less than 
that, it is hard to imagine we are doing 
our best to protect this great Nation. 
There will be more. I am sure there 
will be security briefings for Members 
of Congress going into detail here, but 
the news that is coming out in the 
media is very troubling. 
We need to do all that we can to keep 
America safe. And when adversaries 
such as Russia torment us, tempt us, 
breach the security of our Nation, we 
need to respond in kind. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I am 
encouraged 
that 
we 
are 
making 
progress on coronavirus relief legisla-
tion, but we need to finish up and get 
this bill out the door. The virus is surg-
ing around the country, and we need to 
get help to struggling Americans as 
soon as possible. The time for debate is 
over. Let’s get this done. 
We started this week out with a tre-
mendously hopeful moment in our 
COVID fight—the first vaccinations 
against this virus. It is incredible that 
barely a year since we first learned 
about the virus, we have a vaccine, 
with more vaccines likely on the way. 
I have been thinking a lot this week 
about the people who volunteered for 
vaccine trials. 
We have gained a new appreciation 
this year for a lot of people whose work 
we might have taken for granted in the 
past—the farmers and grocery store 
workers and truckdrivers who kept 
food on our grocery store shelves; the 
delivery drivers, whom we have relied 
on so heavily this year, who have 
brought our packages to us so we can 
minimize our time at the store; all the 
workers whose jobs can’t be done from 
home—from 
electrical 
workers, 
to 
trashmen, to pharmacists—who get up 
every day and put on their masks and 
go out and keep our country running; 
and, of course, our Nation’s medical 
professionals, who have faced down this 
virus with courage and determination 
and with great compassion. 
There have been a lot of quiet heroes 
this year, and the people who volun-
teered for vaccine trials should be high 
on that list. A lot of courageous people 
stepped forward when we needed them, 
and we would not have a COVID vac-
cine today without their willingness to 
help. 
Monday was the beginning of what 
will hopefully be a decisive victory in 
our COVID battle. We owe that to the 
hard work and persistence of medical 
researchers, but we owe it also to the 
vaccine trial volunteers, who enabled 
researchers to complete the process of 
developing a safe and effective vaccine. 
It is no exaggeration to say that the 
bravery of vaccine volunteers could end 
up saving hundreds of thousands or 
even millions of lives. I doubt we will 
ever know most of the volunteers’ 
names, but they are heroes of this bat-
tle just the same, and I am very grate-
ful for the opportunity they have given 
us to defeat this virus. 
TRIBUTE TO JOHANNA JABLONSKI 
Madam President, before I close, I 
would like to take a moment to pay 
tribute to one of my staffers, Johanna 
Jablonski. Johanna is originally from 
the small town of Ethan, SD, and is a 
graduate of and former basketball star 
at Mount Marty College. 
She first joined our team as a sum-
mer intern, working in Sioux Falls. A 
little over 6 years ago, she moved to 
Washington, DC, and became a perma-
nent member of the office. She started 
out as a staff assistant and eventually 
worked her way up to become my 
scheduler—and our starting pitcher, I 
might add—here in DC. 
When Johanna first came to my of-
fice, she intended to move back home 
after a year or two, but God had plans

for her here in DC. About 3 years ago, 
she met her husband Anthony at a Boy 
Scouts fish fry at St. Peter’s Church 
right here on Capitol Hill. I know Jo-
hanna regards that as a blessing for 
her, but it was a blessing for our office, 
too, because we got to keep her around 
a little longer than she had originally 
anticipated. But now, in a couple of 
weeks, Johanna will move back to 
South Dakota. We are all very excited 
for her, but she will be sorely missed. 
Madam President, I know I don’t 
have to tell you or any other Senator 
here just how important the role of a 
scheduler is in any office. The days 
here on Capitol Hill are busy. Our 
schedulers are the ones who bring some 
semblance of organization to an other-
wise chaotic day, making sure we get 
to connect with our constituents in 
town, make it to committee hearings 
and votes on time, get the briefings we 
need on legislation, and much more. 
Johanna is not only a good scheduler, 
she is a great one. I will miss her pa-
tience, her professionalism, and her un-
paralleled ability to keep trains run-
ning on time. But what I and I think 
the rest of my staff will miss the most 
about Johanna is her kindness. Jo-
hanna has had a positive impact on 
pretty much every staffer who has 
worked with me during her time here, 
taking the time to get to know each of 
them on a personal level. Whether she 
is interacting with an agency head, 
constituent, or a fellow staffer, she is 
always the same—unfailingly gracious, 
patient, and kind. 
No matter how busy or chaotic the 
day, Johanna can be counted on to 
bring a steady hand and a positive atti-
tude. She is a woman of deep faith, and 
it shows. I am sad to see her go, but I 
want to wish her the very best of ev-
erything as she embarks on this new 
chapter in life. 
Johanna, thank you for all your hard 
work on behalf of South Dakota. You 
will be missed.

to December funding deadlines or the 
occasional pre-Christmas cliffhanger. 
In that respect, the situation we face 
now is familiar. Funding for the Fed-
eral Government is hanging in the bal-
ance. In the next few days, Congress 
will either succeed or fail at providing 
secure and stable funding for our mili-
tary commanders, our Federal Depart-
ments, and key investments for our fu-
ture. 
Fortunately, our colleagues on the 
Appropriations Committee and their 
House counterparts have been on the 
case. Bipartisan, bicameral committee 
work has full-year government funding 
legislation on the 1-yard line. 
I am optimistic that if we can close 
out our other parallel business, we 
should be able to fund the government 
and move forward together. 
But that brings me to the way in 
which this year is unlike anything we 
have seen before. It has been more than 
9 months since our Nation began to feel 
the full force of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. The American people have done 
what Americans do when crises come 
knocking. 
Essential workers have kept our Na-
tion running. Healthcare professionals 
have worked day and night to care for 
strangers. Heroic American businesses 
have adapted, reinvented, and obeyed 
the advice of medical experts. 
Now we can see the light at the end 
of the tunnel. Operation Warp Speed 
has given us safe and effective vaccines 
in record time, but the American peo-
ple need another bridge to those better 
days that are not so far off. The coun-
try needs Congress to come through 
with another targeted rescue package. 
They have waited months. They have 
waited and suffered, and some have 
died while needless political games 
have played out. The American peo-
ple’s wait for more emergency assist-
ance ought to be over. 
For months, I have called for a tar-
geted, bipartisan package that would 
put hundreds of billions of dollars into 
payroll support, testing, vaccine dis-
tribution, extended unemployment aid, 
safe schools, and other essential prior-
ities. 
So I am encouraged that our Demo-
cratic colleagues have now embraced 
this framework that has been the right 
solution for our country all this time. 
And a bipartisan, bicameral agreement 
appears to be close at hand. 
The outline that I have been dis-
cussing with the Democratic leader, 
Speaker PELOSI, and Leader MCCARTHY 
would get another huge dose of bipar-
tisan support out the door as fast as 
possible. 
We have yet to nail down every de-
tail, but in broad strokes, we have been 
discussing the targeted second round of 
the job-saving Paycheck Protection 
Program that Republicans have sought 
since last summer. 
We are discussing many tens of bil-
lions of dollars for distributing vac-
cines, COVID testing, and equipping 
safe schools to get our kids’ educations 
back on track. We are discussing ex-
tending important unemployment pro-
grams. 
At the particular urging of President 
Trump and Secretary Mnuchin, who 
continue to be the champions of cash 
relief for American families, we are 
discussing more direct impact pay-
ments for individuals, plus the bonus 
for families with children. 
These are just some of the major pil-
lars. And equally important, we are 
agreeing to be smart about financing 
these extraordinary policies. 
Now listen to this. We intend to re-
purpose more than $400 billion in 
unspent funds which we have already 
allocated in the CARES Act. It turned 
out these funds did not need to be 
tapped to restore basic stability to our 
economy. It is time we put that money 
to urgent use. 
Like I said at the time yesterday, I 
am heartened by our discussions and 
our progress. I believe all sides are 
working in good faith for our shared 
goal of getting an outcome. 
But I will say this. In my judgment, 
we are very close to a point that arises 
in every major negotiation. It is the 
point where each side faces a fork in 
the road. 
Do we want to lapse into politics as 
usual and let negotiations lose steam? 
Do we want to haggle and spar like this 
were an ordinary political exercise, get 
wrapped around the axle of language or 
policy riders that we know are con-
troversial, or, on the other hand, after 
months of inaction, do we want to 
move swiftly and with unusual biparti-
sanship to close out our issues, seal the 
deal, and write text that can quickly 
pass into law? 
In short, we are near the point in this 
process where we decide if we are going 
to stay on the fast track or drift back 
toward business as usual. 
I say the answer should be obvious. 
After all these months, struggling 
Americans don’t just need action; they 
need action fast—fast. 
So I continue to appreciate our pro-
ductive discussions, but I hope we also 
remember just how urgent the situa-
tion is for millions and millions of our 
fellow citizens. 
So for the information of all Sen-
ators, we are going to stay right here— 
right here—until we are finished, even 
if that means working through the 
weekend, which is highly likely. 
And if we need to further extend the 
Friday funding deadline before final 
legislation can pass in both Chambers, 
I hope we will extend it for a very, very 
short—short—window of time. 
Our citizens can’t afford for us to get 
bogged down in the back-and-forth. 
Let’s finish up our bipartisan frame-
work. Let’s make law as soon as pos-
sible. That is what our people deserve. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

December 17, 2020 
agreement on an omnibus appropria-
tions bill and a package of emergency 
Federal aid to provide the country re-
lief from the continuing impact from 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Yesterday, House and Senate leader-
ship worked well into the night. We re-
sumed first thing this morning. While 
many, if not all, of the difficult topics 
are behind us, a few final issues must 
be hammered out. We are very close to 
an agreement, but the details really 
matter. When it comes to unemploy-
ment benefits, stimulus checks, aid to 
small businesses, and so much else, we 
have a responsibility to get this right. 
People’s lives depend upon it. 
I would note that had the Republican 
majority joined in negotiations any-
time in the last 6 months, as we had re-
quested, we would not be in the unfor-
tunate position of negotiating against 
the 
government 
funding 
deadline. 
Leader MCCONNELL kept calling for a 
pause, and here we are. I also note that 
we would have a much larger bill that 
met crucial needs of so many Ameri-
cans if Republicans had not been so in-
transigent. 
But we are all eager to conclude our 
work and deliver the relief that the 
American people have been waiting for. 
Everyone wants to see this get done, 
and soon. It is not an easy feat or proc-
ess. We are talking about providing re-
lief to a country that is hurting from 
coast to coast; a country with tens of 
millions of unemployed workers and 
more slipping into poverty every day; a 
country with businesses of all sizes and 
varieties struggling in different ways 
and more in danger of closing for good 
every week; a country that just yester-
day suffered the worst day of the entire 
pandemic—the most cases, the most 
hospitalizations, the most deaths, more 
than 3,600 American lives. 
Already, we know that the size of 
this emergency relief bill would be the 
largest stimulus in the history of our 
country if not for the other COVID re-
lief bill, the CARES bill, which I nego-
tiated with Secretary Mnuchin and we 
passed earlier this year. 
Let me say that again. We are put-
ting the final touches on what would be 
the largest stimulus in the history of 
the country with the exception of the 
CARES Act—larger even than ARRA, 
the stimulus bill Congress passed in 
the wake of the financial crisis in 2009. 
None of the remaining hurdles can-
not be overcome. Everyone is com-
mitted to achieving a result, and we 
will not leave until we get the job 
done. 
I yield the floor.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have to tell you, when I am back home, 
I am struck by one of the things I am 
hearing in Tennessee, and it is this odd 
mix of optimism and also of concern. 
And Tennesseans are very concerned 
that we are not going to pass another 
round of COVID relief in time to help 
save their businesses and in time to 
help people who lost their job through 
no fault of their own. And, on the other 
hand, they are excited about the fact 
that we finally have vaccines that are 
going through the process, that are 
getting to communities, and there are 
vaccinations taking place. And I have 
thought, you know, this is really an in-
teresting mix of emotions, especially 
with Christmas right around the cor-
ner. 
And Sunday, after I had visited with 
some folks, I thought, you know, this, 
I think, is where people are going to be 
for a while. Some are very optimistic. 
Some are incredibly worried. But there 
is one thing that is a constant—and I 
have really watched this grow over the 
last several months. It is the confusion 
and the anger that is directed at the 
Chinese Communist Party. And, quite 
frankly, this is something that I fully 
believe has reached a boiling point 
with Tennesseans and with the Amer-
ican public. 
Tennesseans were familiar with the 
tense relationship between China and 
the United States well before they 
found themselves in the middle of this 
pandemic. Here is a good example. At 
this point, most everyone is familiar 
with China’s notorious disregard for in-
tellectual property rights, but when I 
first started working on this issue in 
the House with songwriters back in 
Tennessee—and it was in the early 
2000s—we felt like we were fighting 
that battle all alone. We had to fight 
with Chinese officials and eventually 
were able to establish some initial roy-
alty rates payable to U.S. copyright 
owners whose sound recordings are 
broadcast in China. That was a solid 
win, but the fact that we had to fight 
so hard for something so simple really 
was frustrating, and people in Ten-
nessee have not forgotten that frustra-
tion. 
Before this year, they were painfully 
familiar with the Chinese Govern-
ment’s abysmal human rights record. 
That initial footage of massive protests 
in Hong Kong had resurrected memo-
ries of Tiananmen Square and re-
minded everyone that the Chinese Gov-
ernment still uses political violence, 
speech suppression, and torture to si-
lence dissent. 
The people I talked to had read about 
diplomatic tensions and trade deals, 
and they could sense that in spite of all 
those optimistic perspectives on the 
nightly news, our biggest rival in Asia 
had become our adversary. 
So they weren’t at all shocked when 
news reports started rolling in that the 
Chinese Communist Party officials in 
Hebei Province and Beijing had done 
nothing—not one thing—to stop the 
spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Since then, Tennesseans and, indeed, 
most Americans have received a valu-
able education, courtesy of Xi Jinping 
and the Chinese Communist Party. We 
learned that the Chinese Government’s 
failure to sound the alarm wasn’t an 
anomaly. It was intentional. Neither 
was there strong-arming of the World 
Health Organization or the incarcer-
ation and torture of doctors and jour-
nalists who defied gag orders to blast 
out warnings to anyone who would lis-
ten. They tried to tell us this was 
reaching a pandemic, and they were 
punished. 
And as they look around at the eco-
nomic ruin in their communities, as 
small businesses are shuttered and 
independent music venues are boarded 
up for the long haul, all those puzzle 
pieces are falling into place, and, quite 
frankly, they are justifiably upset. I 
would venture to say many of them are 
absolutely furious with what the Chi-
nese Government has done. 
By now, we understand this is what 
the Chinese Communist Party does as a 
government, as an all-powerful polit-
ical organization, and as a group of 
rabid ideologues from whom acts of 
genocide flow as easily as the propa-
ganda posted to their many official 
Twitter accounts. This is all a part of 
their quest for global dominance, and 
their success depends on gaining com-
plete control over speech, thought, re-
sources, and their relationships with 
other nations. 
This is the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s master plan. 
When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, 
there were a lot of optimistic pundits 
out there who thought that he would 
embrace transparency and liberal eco-
nomic policies, but oh my goodness, 
have they ever been wrong. In fact, he 
styled himself in the image of Mao, 
creating 
a 
personality 
cult 
that 
equates attacks on Xi with challenges 
to the legitimacy of party rule. It is all 
about him. 
Anyone who has opened a history 
book knows this doesn’t bode well for 
diplomatic efforts to rebalance power. 
This isn’t my political opinion; this is 
the reality that diplomats, members of 
the defense community, and policy ex-
perts accept as a matter of fact. The 
Senate Armed Services Committee ac-
cepted this reality when we drafted the 
bipartisan 2021 NDAA. This year’s bill 
contains the most substantial action 
we have ever taken to counter Chinese 
aggression and great power competi-
tion. It establishes the Pacific Deter-
rence Initiative, which will help the 
military enhance defense capabilities 
in the region and reaffirms our com-
mitments to Taiwan, India, Vietnam, 
Japan, and other allies and partners 
geographically near China. 
We drafted numerous provisions to 
keep U.S. intellectual property, tech-
nology, and data out of Beijing’s grasp 
by limiting funding for universities 
that host Confucius Institutes and re-
stricting defense industrial base em-
ployees from working for Chinese- 
owned companies. Why did we do this? 
Because we have learned that not only 
is this part of China’s propaganda, this 
is where they are embedding their 
spies. 
In 2021, we will take major steps to 
secure our supply chain and invest in 
American innovation to maintain our 
technological advantage. We paid par-
ticular attention to accelerating the 
development of 5G networks that are 
needed by our troops in the field and, 
to complement that expansion, enhanc-
ing our Nation’s cyber security strat-
egy. 
The Chinese Communist Party isn’t 
just playing politics on Twitter; their 
tactics pose a very real threat to our 
Nation’s security and that of our allies 
and our partners. 
I have spoken at length about how 
badly we need to unravel our relation-
ship with China. I have examined prob-
lems related to our medical supply 
chains, security issues in the building 
blocks of popular technology, and 
sourcing for rare earth elements. Re-
claiming these critical resources will 
take time and investment, but it can 
be done, and I will continue to fight for 
this as we move into the next Congress. 
But I want to consider just for a mo-
ment a few examples of this entangle-
ment that hit particularly close to 
home and really give a sense of how 
much private companies and organiza-
tions compromise just to maintain ac-
cess to the Chinese marketplace. 
Earlier this year, the PR profes-
sionals at the NBA worked some seri-
ous overtime after an investigative re-
port published by ESPN showed that 
the Chinese Communist Party-affili-
ated coaches at the league’s training 
facilities in Xinjiang were abusing 
players. That is correct—abusing play-
ers. Initial reports of this abuse were 
ignored by NBA officials. 
Keep in mind that these training fa-
cilities existed in the same region as 
those concentration camps used to im-
prison the Uighur Muslims and others 
guilty of thought crimes against the

Chinese Communist Party. So what 
was the NBA doing there in the first 
place? How could something like this 
actually happen? Here is the reason: 
Communist China plays host to an esti-
mated $4 billion NBA market. They say 
that China is ‘‘basketball obsessed,’’ 
and NBA execs have used every avenue 
they can to take advantage of that $4 
billion market. They jealously protect 
those relationships even if it means 
using skyrocketing sales numbers to 
explain away the blind eye they have 
turned to the CCP’s crimes against hu-
manity. 
They are not alone. This fall, Walt 
Disney 
released 
their 
live-action 
version of ‘‘Mulan’’ and caught some 
well-deserved 
hell 
after 
sharp-eyed 
rights activists combed through the 
credits and discovered that filmmakers 
chose to shoot scenes for the movie— 
where? Xinjiang, knowing that they 
would have to cooperate—with whom? 
The Chinese Communist Party’s propa-
ganda flacks to get the kind of footage 
they wanted to play to their desired 
Chinese audience. 
Netflix also ran afoul of human 
rights activists when they inked an ad-
aptation deal with an author who par-
rots Chinese Communist Party propa-
ganda and made racist comments about 
the persecuted Uighur Muslims in 
Xinjiang. 
None—none of these scenarios in-
volved high-stakes diplomatic negotia-
tions. No one involved was on a mis-
sion to balance the geopolitical scales 
at all cost. They did, however, stand to 
net a tidy profit by maintaining friend-
ly relations with the Chinese Com-
munist Party. But did they ever stand 
up and defend the Uighur Muslim mi-
nority? No, they did not. 
When faced with such manipulation 
on a global scale, Tennesseans expect 
accountability. They want news re-
ports and hearings and absolute con-
demnation. But that is not what they 
get. Instead, they get regurgitated 
propaganda transmitted directly from 
the CCP, peppered with media buzz 
words and distilled into sound bites. 
Our attempts to hold the Chinese 
Communist Party accountable for cov-
ering up the origins of the pandemic 
were met with baseless accusations of 
xenophobia and of racism. I have met 
similar resistance when speaking truth 
to power about the CCP’s aggression in 
Tibet, Mongolia, the concentration 
camps in Xinjiang, and the arbitrary 
detention of the Hong Kong freedom 
fighters. Prominent members of the 
press, pundits, and even Members of 
Congress who have access to more than 
enough information to know better— 
all provide cover for the Chinese Com-
munist Party at the expense of Amer-
ican lives and livelihoods. It is all 
there in black and white. They are fail-
ing an open-book test because they are 
refusing—refusing to admit that their 
coziness with China does not serve the 
American people or our allies well. 
This situation will not evaporate 
with the start of the new Congress. 
Vaccines and defense funding and new 
technology will solve some immediate 
problems, but they are not a strategy. 
Those are action items. 
We must all commit right now to an 
aggressive strategy that leads a whole- 
of-government approach to protecting 
American intellectual property, secur-
ing our critical supply chains, and 
bringing 
our 
manufacturing 
back 
home. 
We must assert our role as a leader 
on the global stage and stand between 
the Chinese Government and leadership 
roles in international organizations. 
How is it that China could have a seat 
on the Human Rights Council of the 
United Nations? Look at what they are 
doing to the Tibetans, to the Tai-
wanese, to the Hong Kong freedom 
fighters, and to the Uighur Muslims. 
We should continue to provide sup-
port for Hong Kong and for Taiwan, 
build a strong network of allies and 
partners across the Indo-Pacific, and 
we should increase our defense invest-
ment in the Indo-Pacific Command. 
I laid out more items in a white 
paper I released earlier this year. It is 
online at Blackburn.Senate.gov. It is 
time to pay attention to everything 
the CCP is doing. 
In today’s New York Post, I have an 
op-ed that lays out how they are using 
Twitter to troll and intimidate the rest 
of the world into staying silent. Do you 
know what? They are, unfortunately, 
having some success with that. World 
leaders, powerful corporations, and ce-
lebrities are all scared into silence by 
online propaganda campaigns. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that a copy of my op-ed be printed 
in the RECORD with these remarks. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Post, Dec. 16, 2020] 
HOW CHINA USES INTERNET TROLLS TO HELP 
COVER UP ITS ATROCITIES 
(By Marsha Blackburn) 
The greatest benefit to Big Tech’s other-
wise dubious influence over our lives is that 
it’s impossible for the world’s human-rights 
violators to hide their crimes. Information 
that years ago would have been filtered by 
official, sanitized sources now flows from 
anyone with the guts to tweet about it. 
But social media’s power to disseminate 
ideas means the tyrants themselves are bet-
ter equipped than ever to obfuscate, lie and 
troll their way out of crises—capitalizing on 
the moral confusion and greed of the modern 
West. 
Last December, freedom fighters a world 
away were busy tweeting about the Chinese 
Communist 
Party’s 
aggression 
in 
Hong 
Kong. Much to the chagrin of party bosses in 
Beijing, guerrilla coverage of mass protests 
spread rapidly, prompting digital activists 
worldwide to condemn the CCP’s latest hor-
ror show. 
Civil-society groups seized the moment to 
spotlight the CCP’s colonialism in Tibet and 
Inner Mongolia, the regime’s cruelty—to-
ward Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and the 
horrifying plight of Falun Gong practi-
tioners. Shock turned into revulsion that 
manifested in demands for change. It was a 
shining moment of international unity that 
vowed an end to totalitarianism in Asia. 
Today, hundreds of dissenters, including 
Hong Kong activists Joshua Wong and 
Jimmy Lai, sit in jail for the sin of criti-
cizing their government. Tibetan language, 
culture and religion are so repressed that 
more than 150 Tibetans have self-immolated 
since 2009. Communist officials terrorize 
Uighurs under the guise of cultural re-edu-
cation, locking dissenters in concentration 
camps and perpetrating mass violence on a 
scale that has prompted many lawmakers 
like me to support legislation labeling the 
violence in Xinjiang a genocide. 
Yet fashionable concern soon gave way to 
a parade of appalling statements from world 
leaders, multinational corporations and ce-
lebrities desperate to preserve their interests 
in China’s economy. Beijing breathed a sigh 
of 
relief 
and 
ramped 
up 
its 
own 
disinformation campaign—about the origins 
of COVID–19 and the Hong Kong crisis—by 
taking a page from the freedom fighters’ 
playbook. 
Between March and September, the CCP 
violated its own ban against Twitter and 
amassed 
nearly 
1.5 
million 
followers 
stretched across dozens of official accounts. 
Using a mix of typical viral content, weird 
propaganda and COVID–19 misinformation to 
attract attention, diplomats and other polit-
ical leaders used their mainstream clout to 
lob insults at Western leaders and dismiss 
the global outcry over Beijing’s atrocities as 
the product of ‘‘racism.’’ 
Beijing’s 
propaganda 
doesn’t 
generally 
pass even a minimal smell test, of course. Its 
play at ‘‘wolf-warrior diplomacy,’’ named 
after a patriotic film franchise, is a trollish 
p.r. campaign that relies on sheer numbers 
and whataboutism to intimidate critics. 
The Chinese diplomats have even learned 
to tap into the rhetoric of wokeness. And 
sadly, it’s working. China’s ‘‘wolf warriors’’ 
can sink their teeth into the impressionable, 
the 
contrarian 
and, 
terrifyingly, 
the 
complicit among Western influencers and au-
diences. 
The CCP is counting on our fear of retalia-
tion, not to mention the undying tendency of 
our own elites to first blame America and 
the West, to mislead us. 
We have no excuse for ignoring reality, 
however. If you need proof, it’s sitting in 
your hand. Google phrases like ‘‘Uighur 
forced sterilization’’ and ‘‘Mongol ethnic as-
similation,’’ then brace yourself. 
Millions of victims of Xi Jinping’s ‘‘China 
Dream’’—a nightmarish blend of ideological 
conformity and behavior controls—regularly 
risk their lives speaking truth to power. 
Meanwhile, in the safe confines of the West, 
powerhouse personalities and companies ago-
nize over the financial risks of criticizing 
Beijing. 
In 50 or 100 years, when historians ask how 
such things could have happened, I hope 
someone invokes the cowardice inherent in 
that cost-benefit analysis as the answer to 
their question. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. If they can do 
that with a hashtag—all of that sup-
pression, all of that intimidation—then 
think about what they will do in the 
real world. 
If we stand down, the Chinese Gov-
ernment is going to keep pushing to 
stand up. They will fill a power vacuum 
because their determination is to be 
the leader, the global dominator. They 
want the 21st century to be the China 
century. It is their strategy. It is what 
they do. So now is the time to act. I 
would encourage my colleagues to re-
member this as we begin a new Con-
gress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7570 
December 17, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMERICAN WORKERS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this 
spring, I was talking with a grocery 
store worker in Ohio, who told me: 
‘‘They call me essential, but I feel ex-
pendable.’’ That grocery store worker 
and thousands of others who are on the 
frontlines of this pandemic risk their 
lives so that Americans can keep food 
on their tables and get their packages 
delivered. They change linen in hos-
pitals. They drive city buses or rural 
buses. They stock shelves in super-
markets. 
When these workers go home at 
night, having been exposed to the pub-
lic pretty much their whole workday, 
they worry they are going to bring the 
virus home and infect their families. 
It is essential workers keeping our 
society going. A number of American 
corporations claim to recognize this. 
They have run feel-good ads—at least 
they did early in the pandemic—saying 
‘‘thank you’’ to essential workers, 
claiming these workers are the heart of 
their companies. 
But saying ‘‘thank you’’ is not nearly 
enough. Workers don’t need a PR cam-
paign. They need fair pay and protec-
tions on the job. These corporations 
get positive press off their workers 
while too often paying them poverty 
wages and, in too many cases, failing 
to protect their safety in the work-
place. 
I wrote an open letter this summer to 
corporate 
executives, 
published 
in 
their paper of record, the Wall Street 
Journal. I said to these corporations: 
You say your workers are essential. 
Then treat them that way. Our econ-
omy is supposed to reward people 
whose talents are in high demand. That 
is what we are all taught. That is what 
you always tell us; right? These work-
ers’ skills keep our economy going. 
Their paychecks should reflect that. 
It has been 6 months since that letter 
was published. It may surprise no one 
to learn that my phone has not been 
ringing off the hook with calls from 
CEOs who want to discuss renewed ef-
forts to invest in their workers. 
All that has changed is that cor-
porate profits have gone up, hazard pay 
has disappeared, and more workers 
have died. Profits are up at most of the 
biggest companies, especially the larg-
est retail companies. 
The Brookings Institution studied 
the 13 biggest retailers in this country 
and found that their earnings have 
shot up 39 percent compared with last 
year, and stock prices are up 33 per-
cent. Guess how much wages have gone 
up. One dollar an hour. 
The Washington Post looked at the 
50 biggest corporations. Between April 
and September, these companies hand-
ed out more than $240 billion—240,000 
million, $240 billion—to their stock-
holders through stock buybacks and 
dividends. 
It is workers making these compa-
nies successful. It is workers risking 
their lives on the job, but shareholders 
got nearly 8 percent of the profits 
workers created. 
Look at Amazon. The company’s 
quarterly profits increased by a stag-
gering 200 percent. But that same Ama-
zon rolled back its tiny $2-an-hour 
raise in June and announced a bonus of 
just $300 per worker. You heard that 
correctly—not $3,000 but $300, from a 
company that brought in $280 billion in 
revenue last year. 
If even a global pandemic, where 
American workers have been on the 
frontlines—if even that—will not get 
corporations to rethink their business 
model that treats workers as expend-
able, then, frankly, it is time—and my 
colleagues should hear this—to stop 
letting them run this economy. 
They had their chance. They failed. 
Just look around us. If corporate 
America won’t deliver for its workers, 
it is time we step in and create a better 
system, centered on the dignity of 
work. 
The American people have made it 
clear that they want a government 
that is on the side of workers. Eighty- 
one million voters gave Joe Biden a de-
cisive victory of more than 7 million 
votes. That is a mandate for change. 
In June, I laid out actions that cor-
porations could take on their own, like 
raising base pay to $15 an hour. Since 
they mostly refused, we should raise 
the Federal minimum wage to $15 an 
hour. 
Workers are still not safe on the job. 
So President Biden can immediately 
issue an OSHA, or Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration, emergency 
temporary standard forcing corpora-
tions to protect their workers. 
Many companies still deny their em-
ployees paid sick leave, even during a 
pandemic. So we have to pass a na-
tional paid family leave plan. 
Corporations are expanding rather 
than ending their exploitive ‘‘inde-
pendent contractor’’ business model. 
So we are going to have to use the law 
to make them treat their workers as 
true employees. You know how they do 
it: Particularly large corporations will 
contract out custodial work, security 
work, and food service work in their 
company cafeteria, for instance. They 
contract it out to a private company 
that pays much less than the corpora-
tion pays, often wages barely above the 
minimum wage. Those workers should 
have to be treated like workers living 
under American labor law. 
Corporations 
continue 
to 
coerce 
workers out of forming unions. So we 
need to pass the PRO Act—Protecting 
Our Right to Organize Act—to em-
power workers with a voice in their 
workplace. 
The economy isn’t physics. It is not 
governed by a scientific law outside 
our control. It is made up of people 
making choices about our values and in 
what kind of society we want to live. 
That is the reason we have an Occu-
pational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration. It is why we have these agen-
cies: to make sure that workers are 
treated fairly to begin with. 
We have the power to change how the 
economy works so that it rewards work 
instead of greed. We can create more 
jobs at middle-class wages. We can give 
people power over their lives and 
schedules. We can expand economic se-
curity and opportunity for everyone. 
Americans voted for this change. 
Americans aren’t going to wait for cor-
porations to reform themselves on 
their own. That is for sure. They never 
have. They never will. It is up to the 
rest of us to deliver for the people 
whom we serve and create a country 
where all work has dignity. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, it is 
my pleasure to honor my good friend 
and my colleague Senator CORY GARD-
NER. CORY and I were friends in the 
House of Representatives. Our friend-
ship deepened in the Senate, especially 
after he took the reins as chair and I as 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on East Asia of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee in the 
115th Congress. 
We were unlikely partners in a lot of 
ways. He is a conservative Republican 
and I am a liberal Democrat. I know 
that Tom Brady is the best quarter-
back ever. He just might say that it is 
John Elway. 
But like me, CORY is a pragmatist, 
and we did find common ground. In 
fact, we were a two-man legislative 
wrecking crew, with several credits to 
our names. 
GARDNER-MARKEY
collaborated 
on 
such hits as the Asia Reassurance Ini-
tiative Act, ARIA, sweeping Asia-fo-
cused legislation to reorient our Indo- 
Pacific strategy around alliances, com-
mon values, and mutual security; the 
Cambodia Democracy Act, to stand up 
for civil society the rights of a polit-
ical opposition; the Taiwan Inter-
national Participation Act of 2018, to 
signal both our commitment to the is-
land nation and our displeasure with 
China’s efforts to shut it out of inter-
national organizations; and the Lever-
age to Enhance Effective Diplomacy 
Act, to build the conditions for a fu-
ture North Korea that no longer 
threatens its neighbors and the world 
with nuclear weapons. 
With CORY as chair and myself as 
ranking member, we convened hear-
ings, drafted broad legislation, hosted

foreign leaders. As the foreign policy 
gravitational pull rightly moved to the 
Indo-Pacific in recent years, CORY 
brought the top policymakers, human 
rights defenders, and government wit-
nesses to the fourth floor of the Dirk-
sen Senate Office Building—not ex-
actly the Diplomatic Room of the 
White House. 
In the 115th Congress, we held 11 
hearings. It was a constant beat of 
meetings and hearings that CORY would 
be leading. I was always honored to be 
partnered with him in organizing those 
efforts. 
CORY grew up on a farm, so it is no 
wonder that he is a workhorse. Each 
time he gaveled in a hearing, he was 
professional, prepared, good-humored. 
And he, on more than a few occasions, 
allowed particularly verbose Senators 
to blow past their allotted time. 
Nowhere did I enjoy our work to-
gether more than in the drafting and 
the ultimate passage of the landmark 
Asia Reassurance Initiative Act. Our 
bill, which is now the law of the land, 
adopts a long-term U.S. strategy for 
the most consequential region in the 
world, the Indo-Pacific. It was a credit 
to our foreign policy staffs—led by Igor 
in CORY’S staff and Zack in mine—that 
we were able to get it past the finish 
line. 
A fully resourced ARIA will ensure 
that the United States will remain a 
Pacific power. Investments through 
ARIA offer a critical counterweight to 
China by helping our partners in the 
region build defenses and defend de-
mocracy and the rule of law. 
But CORY understood passage of a law 
alone does not equate to the implemen-
tation of policy. When ARIA was 
signed into law, he and I convened a se-
ries of hearings to ensure the Depart-
ments of Defense and State and the 
USAID were putting resources to the 
challenge. 
The Asia-Pacific is home to 60 per-
cent of the world’s population. This 
fact and the wide geographic scope of 
the region means that we need to re-
spond nimbly to the latest inter-
national crisis of the day. 
When North Korea policy vacillated 
between ‘‘fire and fury’’ and detente, 
he used the subcommittee to provide 
critical oversight. 
When China and Hong Kong authori-
ties turned to batons and tear gas in a 
futile attempt to end democratic pro-
tests, he hosted one of the architects of 
the student-powered Umbrella Move-
ment, Nathan Law. 
When just this past year, some 
wished to shake down our Japanese and 
South Korean allies, we partnered on 
two resolutions, which reaffirmed our 
ironclad relationships to both allies. 
In his farewell address, CORY
said 
that the pillars of the Senate Chamber 
are principles shared by all Americans. 
They are immutable. CORY, it was a 
pleasure to work with you these past 
years to also strengthen the pillars of 
U.S. foreign policy, standing up for 
human rights, our allies, and the rule 
of law around the world. 
I hope that this son of Yuma, CO, is 
not finished with public service yet. I 
am grateful for what we accomplished 
together on the Asia Subcommittee 
and even more grateful for our friend-
ship. 
My best to Jaime and your wonderful 
family and to you, my friend. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PREVENT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS ACT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this 
all feels strangely familiar. It is the 
middle of December. We are facing a 
government shutdown, arguing behind 
the scenes over the final details, dis-
cussing whether we are going to do a 
short-term CR, wondering what is 
going to happen. Everyone has this 
sense that if we don’t get the bill done 
by tomorrow, then we are going to end 
up in shutdown and all the problems 
that causes. 
Senator HASSAN and I stand in the 
back and hold up our hands and say: In 
February of last year, we proposed a 
solution to this that fits this exact sce-
nario to keep us from holding Federal 
workers and all of our agencies in 
harm’s way. 
The ending government shutdowns 
bill is designed for this moment. For 
whatever reason, we have not been able 
to agree to pass it. It is a process docu-
ment. It doesn’t solve all of the policy 
issues we have. We have real policy dif-
ferences, but we should not have proc-
ess differences at moments like this. It 
is not good for the American people. It 
is not good for the U.S. Senate or the 
U.S. Congress to stand at the precipice 
of a shutdown and to say: Maybe we go 
over; maybe we don’t. Maybe we have a 
short-term 
continuing 
resolution; 
maybe we pass the 12 appropriations 
bills. We shouldn’t ever get to that mo-
ment. 
Our simple idea is not a partisan 
idea. Senator HASSAN and I released a 
simple, straightforward idea. You get 
to the end of the fiscal year, whenever 
that may be, and if we have not fin-
ished all the appropriations work, we 
continue working until it gets done. An 
automatic continuing resolution kicks 
in so that no Federal worker is worried 
that they are going to have furloughs 
right before Christmas; no agency is 
panicked about what happens next and 
who do I have to furlough and who do 
I have to keep and who is essential and 
who is nonessential. None of that hap-
pens. None of that waste occurs. We 
continue debating until we resolve the 
issue. That is all that it is. 
We have 12 appropriations bills that 
are not done. Painfully, in this year of 
COVID, there have been only 22 total 
appropriations hearings in 12 months— 
22. That is 12 appropriations commit-
tees, 12 months, only 22 hearings total 
for all of them. 
We have not completed the appro-
priations work on time, so now we are 
struggling with the what-ifs. Senator 
HASSAN and I have a straightforward 
idea. Let’s pass the end government 
shutdowns bill. Let’s continue our ne-
gotiations so we don’t have to be in the 
shadow of a shutdown again next year. 
It is doable. It shouldn’t be con-
troversial. It should be obvious. When 
we get to a time period like this, if we 
are not complete, we keep working 
until it is done. In the meantime, we 
don’t leave. It is the exact statement I 
have heard from everybody in the 
Chamber so far today. We need to stay 
until it is done. I agree. That should be 
the process every time we get to this 
moment. We stay until the work gets 
done. Our bill just mandates that, and 
it keeps us from ever having to say the 
word ‘‘shutdown’’ again. 
So I would encourage this body 
again, as I did all of last year, as I did 
all of this year: Let’s end government 
shutdowns. Let’s keep debating the 
policy. We have differences. We know 
that. But let’s end the thought of gov-
ernment shutdowns. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, 2020 has 
been a year of immense challenges. We 
are in the middle of an unprecedented 
economic and public health crisis. 
Small businesses have been forced to 
shutter or are barely staying afloat. 
Workers are out of jobs through no 
fault of their own, and folks are 
stressed about feeding their families 
and keeping a roof over their heads. 
Healthcare workers are exhausted— 
pressed to their breaking points from 
treating patients with COVID. 
But, thankfully, there is light at the 
end of the tunnel. With the recent FDA 
vaccine emergency use authorization, 
Michiganians and Americans are fi-
nally starting to receive much needed 
reinforcements to combat and to con-
trol this virus. 
Although there is light at the end of 
the tunnel, we know the next 2 or 3 
months or more are going to be dif-
ficult. We cannot let our guard down. 
We must continue to wear a mask, 
practice social distancing, and wash 
our hands. We all can—and we must— 
play an important role in defeating 
this virus, and we can do that if we 
work together. 
Working together is the key to get 
through this pandemic. We know what 
happens when we work together here in 
this Chamber. Early on in this pan-
demic, we worked together to pass the 
CARES Act, which provided vital re-
sources and support to keep families 
and workers afloat. 
We worked together to pass addi-
tional aid for small businesses, for test-
ing, for healthcare providers, and for 
hospitals. And, right now, we need to

once again come together and work to-
gether to pass another round of help. 
We have done it before, and we did it 
when case counts were far lower than 
they are now. 
We need to summon the same sense 
of urgency, and we must come together 
at the end of this week and pass mean-
ingful bipartisan and comprehensive 
COVID relief. We must prove to the 
American people that bipartisan nego-
tiation is not a relic of the past. 
As I talk to Michiganians each and 
every day, the message is very clear. 
They want us to put partisan politics 
aside and solve the very real challenges 
confronting our country. 
Finding common ground and bringing 
people together has always been my ap-
proach to serving Michigan and the 
people of this Nation. This past year, I 
am proud to say, we worked together 
to advance legislation on priorities 
that not only addressed the pandemic 
but 
also 
tackled 
issues 
facing 
Michiganians and people across this 
country each and every day. 
On a bipartisan basis, we have been 
able to pass legislation out of Congress 
on a number of topics, whether it has 
been expanding apprenticeship oppor-
tunities for veterans, closing loopholes 
that pose a threat to our national secu-
rity, saving taxpayer dollars, pro-
tecting the Great Lakes, which is one 
of our Nation’s most precious natural 
resources, hiring more agricultural in-
spectors at our Nation’s ports of entry, 
or improving the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs caregiver program. 
I want to take this opportunity to 
thank my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle for their partnership with me 
in advancing these priorities. I know 
there is no shortage of differences 
among us, but when we put personal 
politics aside and focus on addressing 
the problem at hand, I know we can get 
results. 
As we enter this next session of Con-
gress, I am hopeful that we can build 
on some of the progress we have made. 
Whether it is supporting small busi-
nesses, 
lowering 
prescription 
drug 
costs, ensuring our Nation remains a 
global leader in innovation, or getting 
through this public health and eco-
nomic crisis, there is much more that 
can be done in the next Congress when 
we are all willing to reach across the 
aisle to find lasting solutions. 
Two years ago, I delivered George 
Washington’s Farewell Address on the 
Senate floor. It is an annual tradition 
here in the Senate. In that address, 
President Washington warned of the 
dangers of tribalism and political po-
larization in our country. We cannot 
forget President Washington’s mes-
sage, particularly during these uncer-
tain and daunting times. We cannot let 
polarization prevent us from doing the 
people’s work. Let us build on that 
spirit of bipartisanship. Let us work 
together to get things done. Our con-
stituents demand it. 
This week, we can again work in a bi-
partisan way to pass a COVID relief 
bill that makes a difference to every-
one suffering from this pandemic.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk again 
about the need for us to pass a legisla-
tive package, which I would call an 
emergency package, to deal with our 
COVID–19 crisis we have in this coun-
try. 
As we talk today on the floor of the 
Senate, there are negotiators working 
busily in a room nearby to try to come 
up with that package, and that is a 
good thing. I know they have run into 
some roadblocks, at least so I have 
been told. We need to work through 
those roadblocks. They are relatively 
small compared to the importance of 
the overall mission of helping the peo-
ple we represent, helping those small 
businesses, helping those hospitals, 
helping those families who find them-
selves without a paycheck through no 
fault of their own. And my hope is that 
we can get there. 
The legislation that is being looked 
at today, which may be part of a larger 
package that we will vote on either to-
morrow or the next day, is, as I under-
stand it, informed by work that a bi-
partisan group of us did over the past 
several weeks. I appreciate my col-
leagues so much. I see Senator MUR-
KOWSKI is here on the floor today. She 
was one of those people. Senator 
MANCHIN was one of the people to help 
organize it. In fact, I think the first 
meeting was because LISA MURKOWSKI 
invited people to have pizza at her 
place. And that resulted in a very posi-
tive interaction between Democrats 
and Republicans on a lot of detail, a lot 
of specific issues, to be able to put to-
gether a package that will help our 
country right now to work through 
this crisis. 
I wish I could say that things are bet-
ter. But when I look at my own home 
State of Ohio, I see just the opposite. 
In fact, over the past few weeks, we 
have had weekly cases that have in-
creased, not decreased. Our number of 
daily new cases is averaging around 
10,000 a day now every day. That is dou-
ble what it was just a month ago. At 
least in my State, the coronavirus cri-
sis has increased, not decreased. 
By the same token, the economic cri-
sis that is a result of the COVID–19 cri-
sis has continued to grow. We have 
seen people who have lost their jobs be-
cause their restaurant doesn’t have 
any business, not because there is a 
government edict; although, there are 
in some States. Some States have said 
you have to shut down. Some States 
have gone so far as to say you have to 
shut down outdoor dining, not just in-
door dining. Of course, those people 
have lost their jobs. 
In many cases, it is just because the 
virus is so prevalent, people aren’t

going out; they aren’t going shopping; 
they aren’t going to the movie theater; 
they aren’t going to the bowling alley; 
they aren’t going to the restaurant; 
and they aren’t going to the hotels. 
Folks are losing their jobs. Again, not 
because of something they did or some-
thing they could control. It is almost 
like a natural disaster, and, therefore, 
they need some help and need it now. 
We really have kind of a K-shaped re-
covery here. People talk about a V- 
shaped recovery, where you have a re-
cession and you come right back out 
the same way you went in. I wish that 
were the case here. Instead, it is kind 
of K-shaped. We do have some indus-
tries that are doing quite well, actu-
ally. In some areas of the country, they 
are doing OK. That is the top of the K. 
But the bottom of the K is those who 
are not. If you are in the hospitality 
business, the travel business, if you are 
someone who has a job that is no 
longer there because of this crisis, then 
you are in trouble. You are in trouble. 
I am told that I have now given 20 
floor speeches on the need for us to do 
something. I think it ought to be tar-
geted. I think it ought to be focused. 
What I have said is that we have this 
wonderful new vaccine coming out. 
Moderna is about to be approved, I be-
lieve. Pfizer was just approved. I am in 
a trial for the Janssen, J&J—Johnson 
& Johnson—vaccine, actually. I think 
that is coming along well. We will 
probably have AstraZeneca coming 
soon. 
This is something that is very posi-
tive about this crisis. We actually fi-
nally have something that can help us 
turn the corner. I think it is important 
that we wear our masks. I think it is 
important that we social distance. I 
think it is important that we use the 
hand sanitizer—all of that. We need to 
keep doing it. But the difference be-
tween that and the vaccine is that the 
vaccine gives you the immunity we are 
all seeking. People talk about herd im-
munity and that that could come— 
early on people said—by so many peo-
ple getting infected. We can’t have that 
happen. Why? Because that will lead to 
a lot of pain, a lot more deaths. Three 
hundred thousand people have already 
died in this country from this crisis. 
We don’t want to bring herd immunity 
in that way. We want to bring herd im-
munity from the vaccine. 
By the way, these vaccines are safe. 
They are effective. I mean, if you look 
at the numbers, 95 percent efficacy— 
unbelievable. Do your own research 
and look at it and make your own deci-
sion, but this is not a situation where, 
as with the flu, actually—when you 
take the flu shot, I am told, only about 
one-third of the time does it work and 
about two-thirds of the time it doesn’t. 
That has happened to my family mem-
bers, probably to you or your family 
members, where you take a flu shot, 
and it doesn’t really help. But here, 90, 
95 percent, 98 percent—the numbers are 
amazing. Take a look at them—‘‘effi-
cacy,’’ meaning that is how effective 
they are. Again, in the trial that I am 
in, the initial numbers are quite posi-
tive. 
Also, it was done in a way that I 
think makes a lot of sense for the fu-
ture in terms of public-private partner-
ship. The government basically said to 
these companies that we will provide a 
market for you if you get busy pro-
ducing this lifesaving vaccine. By the 
way, you can go ahead and start pro-
ducing the vaccine, even before it is ap-
proved so we don’t have to wait 4, 5 
months after an approval to then get 
the production up and going. If you 
don’t get the approval, we are going to 
throw away the vaccine. 
It was worth doing. It was probably 
the best expenditure of Federal money 
we had here in the last package, the 
CARES package, because it ensured 
that we not only would get these vac-
cines quickly, but we would get them 
distributed quickly. As an example, 
even while the vaccines were being ap-
proved recently—and these were the 
Pfizer vaccines—those vaccines were 
already on their way to my home State 
of Ohio. They were pre-positioned 
there. And when the approval came, we 
could move quickly. People are being 
vaccinated today in my State and in 
your State—primarily, people who are 
on the frontlines as healthcare pro-
viders. 
Next, we are helping with the nursing 
homes, people who come in and out of 
the nursing homes, which is where, ob-
viously, most of this disease happens, 
and then the people in the nursing 
homes, then our EMS and other first 
responders, people who have health 
problems, 
preconditions 
that 
make 
them more vulnerable to the virus, sen-
iors. This is really exciting. This is the 
answer. This is what is going to help us 
turn the tide, but that is going to be a 
ways off until that is widely available. 
What I think, in terms of this pack-
age, again—I think of it as a bridge. It 
is an emergency package to get us from 
where we are now to this period prob-
ably in the March, April, May time pe-
riod, when the vaccine will be widely 
available, and we will be able to have 
that kind of herd immunity we talked 
about earlier. We don’t want commu-
nity spread. We want community im-
munity. And that is the idea. 
The package that the bipartisan 
group put together was $908 billion. Six 
of the ten of us voted for that. All of us 
voted for a smaller package, which was 
$748 billion. It is important to note 
that of that $908 billion, or $748 billion, 
we also repurposed a lot of money that 
has already been spent. So, roughly, 
$600 billion was pulled back from the 
PPP program that had not been spent 
yet and also from a Trump program 
that the Treasury and the Fed had to 
provide loans that were not being used. 
That is the 13(3) Program you might 
have heard about. That program, fortu-
nately, was not tapped into because the 
commercial bank stepped in and pro-
vided a lot of that lending that was 
necessary. Rates are at historic lows 
right now for mortgages, as an exam-
ple, and other loans, so they didn’t 
need to step in. That money is being 
repurposed. So, instead of $748 billion, 
it is more like $148 billion; instead of 
$908 billion, if you went for the whole 
thing, it is more like $300 billion—not 
that that is not a lot of money. It is. 
But compare that to what was being 
talked about only a couple of weeks 
ago and for the previous 9 months, by 
the way, which was a package in the 
House of Representatives, called the 
Heroes Act, which was trillions of dol-
lars—$3.5 trillion, initially, and then 
they agreed, maybe, $2.4 trillion. I 
think the last offer that was on the 
table that they didn’t take was $1.8 
trillion. We are not talking about those 
kind of numbers now. We are talking 
about a bridge, on an emergency basis. 
It is targeted and focused. I will give 
you an example of that. 
In this package—the bipartisan pack-
age, which I hope is picked up, and I 
think it will be by the package that 
the final negotiators are working on. 
That would be Secretary Mnuchin, who 
has been very eager to get an agree-
ment that helps the American people, 
working for the President, but also the 
leadership here—the Democratic lead-
er, the Republican leader, and in the 
House, the Democratic leader, the 
Speaker, and the Republican leader. 
That is the group right now. What they 
are saying is, we want to get a package 
done. I think, as an example, with the 
PPP program, they will end up picking 
up what this bipartisan group agreed 
to, which is to have a more narrow 
Paycheck Protection Program, PPP, to 
help small businesses but to particu-
larly focus on those businesses that are 
small businesses, instead of under 500 
as an example, maybe 300 people, and 
those that are really hurting; in other 
words, those that are losing money rel-
ative to where they were last year. 
When you do a quarter-to-quarter com-
parison—fourth 
quarter 
this 
year, 
fourth quarter back in 2019—if you 
have a loss, let’s say, of 25 percent or 30 
percent, that is significant. With the 
funding that we have, isn’t it better to 
target that funding toward those small 
businesses that are really hurting? 
That, I think, will be in the final pack-
age. 
Again, I commend my bipartisan col-
leagues for coming up with some of 
these ideas and working out some of 
this stuff because there are some dif-
ferences. By the way, no one of the 10 
of us involved in this thing, agreed 
with every part of this package, trust 
me. 
I would have written a different 
package, as any of my colleagues would 
have, but it was necessary to get to 
yes, to get to a result. We have done 
that and, I think, again, it will inform 
where we end up in terms of the pack-
age coming to the floor. 
The Paycheck Protection Program is 
a good example of that. We also pro-
vided in that program loan forgiveness 
for small loans—$150,000 or less—in a

very 
simplified 
manner, 
so 
you 
wouldn’t have to go through all the bu-
reaucracy and the costs and the loops 
and the hoops, which small businesses 
just can’t afford to do. So I am proud of 
our work there as well. 
We also provided help to some of the 
hardest hit industries, including the 
airline industry. We want to keep a 
viable airline industry in this country. 
We don’t want them to go bankrupt 
and planes to stop flying. We actually 
want, over this bridge period—between 
now and, as I mentioned, March, April, 
May—to be sure that the economy can 
get back on its feet as quickly as pos-
sible. That is why we don’t want these 
small businesses to go out of business 
and their employees to be put on the 
unemployment lines. That is why we 
want to be sure our airlines can con-
tinue. They are having a tough time. 
But 90,000 jobs alone in this industry 
will be lost, we are told, unless we do 
something along the lines we did in the 
bipartisan package—90,000 additional 
jobs lost. We don’t want that. We want 
to be sure we are positioned for growth. 
By the way, in my view—for what-
ever it is worth—I think this economy 
is incredibly resilient. I know it is not 
going great right now. We still have 10 
million people out of work who were 
working as of February of this year. 
We have 10 million people who haven’t 
found their way back to work yet. We 
still have relatively high unemploy-
ment compared to where we were. In 
my State, it is about double where it 
was. But we have been resilient, given 
what we have been hit with. I believe 
that if we can get to this period of time 
where we have the vaccine readily 
available, we are poised for a takeoff. 
I think there is pent-up demand. 
Among 
my 
constituents, 
they 
are 
going to be happy to get out and shop 
again—to go to the restaurants and go 
to the hotels, to travel, to go to the 
movie theaters and go to the stages, 
the places where there is a performance 
that has to be canceled now and where 
people are struggling to keep these 
venues open. Those will not just be re-
opened. People, I think, will flock 
there. We have to get through to that 
period. 
In my view, it is worth helping to en-
sure that in the interim period, we 
don’t have even more pain and more 
loss in jobs and are prepared to move 
forward. 
On unemployment insurance, again, 
if you lost your job, not because of 
what you did but because of what I said 
earlier—almost like a natural disaster 
of the virus—we should provide addi-
tional help. We do that in the legisla-
tion. 
The day after Christmas, the current 
relief ends in terms of the Federal help 
and unemployment insurance. That is 
not something that any of us should 
want to see. If you are self-employed, if 
you are a so-called gig economy work-
er, then, you are able to get unemploy-
ment insurance right now if you don’t 
have a job. If you can’t work because of 
this virus, you can get unemployment 
insurance. That is not typical in my 
State, and it is not typical in most 
States. 
But because of the Federal law we 
passed, 
the 
CARES 
Act—again, 
9 
months ago—that is permitted, but it 
ends the day after Christmas. I have 
people self-employed coming up to me 
back home saying: I have to know. I 
don’t know if I can pay the rent. I don’t 
know if I can make a car payment. I 
need to know. I don’t know if I can 
make my mortgage. 
We are going to tell them, I hope, in 
this legislation that passes that, in-
deed, they are going to get the cov-
erage. And the 13 weeks of the Federal 
extension on the State unemployment 
will also be extended so that the day 
after Christmas, again, people aren’t 
falling off the cliff. 
Again, the Federal supplement per 
week originally was $600 per week, as 
you know. That $600 per week, I 
thought, was relatively high, meaning 
that many people were getting more on 
unemployment than they were in their 
jobs. That was a problem for many em-
ployers, typically small employers that 
had a tough time getting people to 
come back to work. As the economy 
started to improve after the March, 
April, May time period, when things 
started to pick up a little bit, it was 
tough. 
This compromise, I think, will be 
$300. Maybe it will be $200. I don’t know 
what exactly they are working out. 
Our proposal was $300, which is a bipar-
tisan compromise. Many Democrats 
would like to go back to the $600. Some 
Republicans think it should be less 
than $300. But this is a compromise, 
and it is a way for us to ensure that 
during this time period—and this is for 
16 weeks only, so between now and the 
end of March—on this bridge that we 
talked about, if people are unemployed 
through no fault of their own, they 
should be able to get a little bit to be 
able to put food on the table, make the 
car payment, make the rent. That is in 
this package, too. 
There is also funding in here for rent-
al assistance. As you know, some peo-
ple have been hanging on wondering if 
they are going to be evicted or not. 
Evictions make no sense right now for 
the tenants or the landlords or the 
economy. We don’t want people out on 
the street. Landlords don’t want to go 
through the pain of having to go 
through an eviction and trying to find 
somebody else. They can get some help 
just to hold on during this period. 
There is funding in rental assistance to 
help keep people in their homes with a 
roof over their head as we go through 
this period. 
The final one I want to talk about— 
and there are a lot of other provisions 
here that I don’t have time to go into. 
What I want to talk about is one that 
is a heartbreaker for me. For many 
years now, we have been challenged 
with this drug addiction issue, particu-
larly opioids. It is prescription drugs 
and heroin and fentanyl, the deadly 
synthetic opioid—to the point that 
only 4 years ago, we had the highest 
rates of overdose deaths in the history 
of our country. Seventy-two thousand 
people were dying a year. A lot of us fo-
cused on that year. 
For the past 4 or 5 years, this Con-
gress spent money and changed policies 
to help people get treatment and get 
into longer term recovery. More money 
went into prevention activities to keep 
people from getting into the funnel of 
addiction, in the first place. This was 
at epidemic levels. 
In 2018 and 2019, we started to see a 
reversal of that for the first time in 
really 3 decades. Every year—for some-
thing like 30 years—in my home State 
of Ohio, we would see more overdose 
deaths every year—every year. In 2018, 
we had a 20-plus percent reduction in 
overdose deaths. It was about a 22-per-
cent reduction in Ohio—a 22-percent re-
duction of deaths. That is because we 
all focused at the Federal level, State 
level, and local level, and we made a 
difference. 
We began to change this dynamic of 
young people and middle-aged people 
and across the spectrum. Regardless of 
the ZIP Code you lived in, you were 
being affected by this. We changed it so 
that people were actually getting the 
help they needed, getting out from 
under their addiction, getting back to 
work and back to their families. It was 
good news. The heartbreaking part of 
this for me is that, having made that 
progress, finally, we now see, during 
this coronavirus pandemic, an epi-
demic underneath it. It is the epidemic 
of drug addiction. 
There are new numbers out today 
that I saw that don’t surprise me as 
much as they discourage me, which is 
that, this year, instead of 72,000 people 
dying of overdose deaths in America 
from drug abuse—this is not just 
opioids 
but 
all 
drugs, 
including 
psychostimulants, like methamphet-
amine; crystal meth from Mexico that 
is cheap, powerful, deadly—this year, it 
is expected that our overdose death 
rate will be the highest ever. We are 
getting back to where we were. Plus- 
83,000 is the number I saw today. Re-
member, I mentioned 72,000 people 
dying only 4 years ago. Now we are 
back to 83,000. This is a crisis within a 
pandemic, and we need to deal with it. 
There are lots of different opinions 
out there as to why this is happening. 
I believe strongly a lot of this is just 
from the isolation that comes from 
this pandemic. People haven’t been 
able to go and meet with and talk to 
their recovery coaches, which is one of 
the ways that we were changing this 
dynamic. People were able to meet 
with people who were recovering ad-
dicts themselves to help them get 
through it. It was working for a lot of 
people. 
Yet at some of these longer term re-
covery places where people can be—say 
a home, a sober home—they had issues 
with the pandemic and have not been

able to have the group homes provide 
that care. 
Also, people have not been able just 
to go see their doctors or their treat-
ment 
providers. 
Telemedicine 
has 
helped. That is one reason in our pack-
age that we put more funding into tele-
medicine, because that is a way you 
can get to people. Both in regard to be-
havioral health, mental health issues, 
and with regard to addiction, it hasn’t 
filled the gap. 
Also, a lot of people are feeling a 
great deal of stress and even despair 
and joblessness. And, obviously, if you 
go to the food banks in Ohio, you see 
people who are in their cars waiting for 
3, 4, 5, 6 hours at times. There is some-
thing going on here, folks. These are 
people who are feeling desperation. To 
wait in line for 6 hours to get a box of 
food means that you have a real prob-
lem in your family. 
By the way, some of these people— 
because I talked to people who have 
gone to these food banks—have never 
been in a food bank in their lives. They 
found themselves in a tough situation. 
Again, it is not everybody. Remem-
ber the K-shaped recovery? For some 
people, it has been fine. If you are a 
white collar worker and you can 
telework from home virtually—maybe 
you are in the finance industry or 
maybe you are in the tech industry— 
you might be doing great. But your 
neighbor who has a job at that res-
taurant or perhaps in another business 
like the travel business or the motor-
coach business, they don’t have the op-
portunities to get that job. They are 
the ones in the food bank line. 
By the way, putting more funding 
into the food banks, as well as into 
helping people to be able to afford food, 
is, obviously, a big issue right now. 
The notion here is that, with this 
legislation, we are going to provide 
more help for people who are suffering 
from addiction, with the thought of 
trying all we can to try to reverse this 
trend. 
Ultimately, again, the best way to 
reverse it is to have this coronavirus 
pandemic behind us so that people can 
socialize again and gather again and 
aren’t feeling the despair, aren’t iso-
lated. And that is coming. 
But the bridge to there is important 
so we save as many lives as we can. 
There is $5 billion in our legislation— 
the bipartisan bill—to do just that. My 
hope is, again, that that will be in the 
final package, and I believe it will be. 
I believe that what the negotiators are 
working on is very similar to what is 
in the legislation that we came to-
gether with as a bipartisan group. 
My only disappointment in the group 
is that we couldn’t end up with this 
combination of State and local fund-
ing—targeted toward need, by the way, 
not the way it was done last time, per 
capita, but targeted for need—and li-
ability protection for these small busi-
nesses, 
for 
these 
private 
nursing 
homes, for these EMS personnel, for 
emergency medical people who are con-
cerned. They are concerned about it. 
What we tried to put together was a 
package that said: OK, if you are a bad 
actor, if you didn’t follow the rules— 
and the rules were pretty clear—you 
aren’t protected. You are accountable. 
But if you followed the rules, and you 
were trying your best to deal with 
ever-changing 
standards—and, 
let’s 
face it; they have been quite different. 
Remember back in March and April, 
people were saying: Don’t wear a mask. 
Now, of course, we know that was a 
mistake. At the time, we didn’t. The 
notion is to protect people from frivo-
lous lawsuits who were doing their 
best. 
By the way, there was a survey done 
of people saying: Do you think there 
should be protection for people who are 
doing their best, whereas people who 
are grossly negligent—that was the 
word used, ‘‘gross negligence’’—would 
not be protected; they would be ac-
countable? And 79 percent of the Amer-
ican people agreed with that. 
There has also been polling out there 
with regard to small businesses, from 
the NFIB, saying that 70 percent of 
small businesses are very concerned 
and worried about this. Again, think of 
the business. Revenue has crashed. 
Profits have crashed. They are hanging 
on. The PPP is going to help them be-
cause we are getting more PPP. The 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
we talked about earlier, will help to 
get them through this. 
If they are facing a lawsuit—whether 
they win it or not, whether they can 
prove that they were doing the right 
thing—just the cost of that lawsuit 
could well be the difference of that 
small business continuing operations 
or not. 
Nonprofits. The nonprofits in Ohio 
are very interested in the liability re-
forms, as are the education commu-
nity—the higher ed people, the school 
teachers—as 
are 
people 
in 
the 
healthcare industry across the board— 
nursing homes and hospitals. My hope 
is that we can get back to work on 
that. Perhaps after this legislation has 
passed, as we look at what we do next, 
let’s be sure that we are providing that 
protection in combination with pro-
viding that help to our State and local 
governments that need it, where they 
can demonstrate they need it. I don’t 
think it will be in this package, but it 
should be in the next package. 
I will say, this legislation on COVID 
is needed and we ought to move it now. 
We cannot go home for the holidays 
without passing COVID–19 rescue legis-
lation. 
Again, to me, it is a rescue package. 
It is not a stimulus package as much as 
it is getting us through this period, 
providing that bridge between now and 
when the vaccine is readily available. 
This legislation is likely to be part of 
a broader bill that will include a num-
ber of things, including spending for 
the year so we don’t have a govern-
ment shutdown. It is a good thing not 
to have a government shutdown. 
It is also likely that it will include 
some tax provisions which are so-called 
tax extenders. 
I would say one thing, that I hope it 
includes is the permanent extension of 
tax relief for our craft beverage indus-
try. This would be craft breweries, 
craft vintners, craft distillers. We 
passed legislation a few years ago that 
was very important to them, that al-
lowed them to have a reduction in the 
excise tax they pay on certain vol-
umes—relatively low volumes of their 
product. 
As a result, many of these businesses 
have been able to expand, hire people, 
and now they have the possibility of 
this expiring at the end of the year and 
having a big bill due that they cannot 
afford. 
We are proud in Ohio to be the home 
of an industry, the craft beer produc-
tion industry. It is now No. 6 in the 
country. It supports 81,000 jobs. It is a 
business that has been hurt for two 
reasons: One, if you think about it, the 
restaurants aren’t doing the business 
they used to do, so if you are providing 
your product to a restaurant, you are 
hurt. But also, a lot of these craft dis-
tillers or craft brewers or craft vint-
ners have their own tasting rooms or 
their own brew pubs, and those, in 
some cases, have been shut down alto-
gether. In other cases, their revenues 
have crashed, so it would not be the 
time for them to be facing a big tax 
bill, and that is what the excise tax 
would be. Income tax you pay later in 
the year; excise tax you would have to 
pay right away. 
So my hope is that that will be ex-
tended permanently. More than half 
the Members of this body joined me 
and Senator WYDEN on a letter to our 
leadership about this, urging that this 
extender, which has worked so well to 
increase jobs and opportunity in Amer-
ica, can continue on a permanent basis 
going forward. 
My hope is that that is part of the 
package as well. That will help in 
terms of the economic stimulus part of 
this, which is also important. 
I thank you for what you are doing if 
you are one of those people out there 
who is promoting the vaccines and 
talking about the importance of our 
getting the vaccines. If you are not, I 
hope you will look at the research. I 
hope you will look at the fact that we 
should be encouraging everyone to get 
vaccinated unless someone has a health 
problem that makes it difficult for 
them. 
The polling data is not encouraging 
on this. The last Gallup poll shows that 
only 58 percent of Americans are com-
fortable being vaccinated. That needs 
to change. 
I have heard some people say: Well, 
when you look at the polling, it shows 
that Democrats are concerned because 
this happened in the Trump adminis-
tration, this vaccine development. 
This is not political. Take the poli-
tics out of it. 
These are scientists. They have been 
working around the clock over the past

9 months, 10 months, to get us to this 
point. These are scientists who are now 
working around the clock to look care-
fully at these vaccines to determine 
whether they are approved or not. 
These are the scientists who are mak-
ing decisions, not the politicians. It is 
the people in the white coats. We need 
to trust them, for the sake of our coun-
try, because we need to reverse this 
terrible virus and the pandemic that is 
causing all of the issues that we talked 
about earlier today, to our commu-
nities, to our families. So the way to 
do that is to ensure that we do, in fact, 
not just have this vaccine available but 
that people take advantage of it and 
are willing to be vaccinated. 
I hope, if you are listening this 
evening, that you will pass that word 
along and that you, again, will do your 
own research. Look at it. But my hope 
is that the conclusion will be to get to 
the period we want to get, which is to 
have people feel like they can reengage 
in the economy and feel like they can 
be back with their loved ones and con-
gregate and feel like they can go back 
to church or their other place of wor-
ship; they feel like they can send their 
kids back to school; they feel like they 
can get back to a more normal life. 
That will happen through the accessi-
bility and the ability to actually get 
that vaccine. 
So my hope is that those listening 
tonight will do that and do their part 
in spreading that message instead of 
spreading the virus. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
had an opportunity to listen to my 
friend and colleague from the State of 
Ohio outline in great detail the efforts 
that a bipartisan group has been work-
ing on for just a month now. 
It was just a month ago, I was re-
minded—November 
17, 
apparently— 
that I had an opportunity to invite 
some colleagues over to my house for 
dinner and conversation. And while it 
wasn’t pizza, it didn’t make any dif-
ference what we were eating. It was all 
about the conversation and what we 
could do to be responsive to the ur-
gency of the need. 
As my friend from Ohio has said, peo-
ple in Ohio are suffering. People in 
Alaska are suffering. People around the 
country are suffering. And they are 
looking to us for answers and for hope. 
I felt on Monday that there was that 
sense of hope that we could offer. It is 
not the end-all and be-all in terms of a 
legislative proposal, but it was a dozen 
Members, bipartisan—Republicans and 
Democrats from this body, as well as 
Republicans and Democrats from the 
House—coming 
together 
over 
the 
course of a month, hours on Zoom, 
digging into the details and the issues 
in a way that, as someone who has been 
part of this body now for 18 years, I 
have not had the opportunity to be as 
engaged in every level of the debate 
and aspect as we were in these con-
versations. 
The Senator from Ohio, while he 
might not have been at that dinner, 
was with us every step of the way and 
was truly leading on the negotiations 
when it came to the liability provisions 
and the input in so many other areas. 
But what we were able to outline, 
given a framework of how we can be re-
sponsive to the pandemic and the eco-
nomic crisis at hand, focusing on the 
most vulnerable—those who have lost 
their jobs, those who have a small busi-
ness that is open but just barely open 
because there are no customers or be-
cause the limitations on your res-
taurant are so small you can barely 
even afford to keep your doors open—to 
be responsive to those who have lost 
their jobs, to those who are looking at 
the first of January and wondering if 
they are going to be able to stay in 
their home or in their apartment, to 
those families who have children at 
home who haven’t been in a classroom 
since March of this year, for those 
rural healthcare providers that have 
been struggling as they have tried to 
meet the crush of demand and need 
within their small hospitals. 
What we tried to do was build a pack-
age that was responsive to the emer-
gency 
at 
hand. 
And 
as 
Senator 
PORTMAN has noted, this was not de-
signed to be a stimulus bill. This is not 
designed to be the end-all, be-all for 
how we move forward. It is targeted 
emergency relief. 
What we were able to present on 
Monday, which I felt was so hopeful, 
were not only the debate and the con-
tours of the framework but then to ac-
tually put that into legislative text—5 
or 6 inches of legislative language, a 
bill—a bill for this body to consider, a 
path to move us forward at a time 
when it is so incredibly critical. 
Also on Monday, we were met with 
hope because the vaccine—the long- 
promised vaccine—has come about in 
extraordinarily short order, historic ef-
forts by so many to get the develop-
ment to this point, to get the approval, 
the safe approval, and now moving for-
ward to distribution. 
The headline in our largest news-
paper yesterday was ‘‘Morale gets a 
boost’’ as vaccine arrives. And, boy, do 
we need a morale boost. 
This is a dark time in Alaska right 
now. The sun sets about, I don’t know, 
maybe about 3:45 in the afternoon right 
now, so it makes for a short day. But 
we are used to short days because we 
know that in the darkest times of win-
ter, there is going to come that time 
when things start to change and the 
days actually begin to get longer; the 
sunlight is with us more and more. 
And as Alaskans are considering the 
very deep, deep economic strife that we 
are in right now, we know that there is 
light at the end because the vaccine is 
arriving; that is coming. 
But in the meantime, they need to 
get from here to there. So what we 
have outlined in this proposal—this bi-
partisan, bicameral proposal—is just 
exactly that. It is that lifeline that can 
get them from December to March, to 
April, when hope really starts to re-
turn. 
So I know that there is a great deal 
that is being considered right now. As 
I have shared with folks, I say: Well, 
we were able to advance the ball sig-
nificantly with this effort that we have 
made. But when we presented that 
multihundred-page package to the pub-
lic, to the administration, to leader-
ship, we basically said: Here is a gift. 
Take it. 
So we have kind of lost ball control, 
if you will. That is good. That is fine. 
That is what this process is all about. 
But I am just urging that we commit 
with every sense of expediency and ur-
gency to do our business quickly and 
fairly, with the politics aside, because 
the last thing that folks back home 
need, whether it is in Ohio or Alaska, 
is to know that we might have wrapped 
up our business here, and we didn’t 
hear them. We didn’t respond to their 
need. We left them hanging. That is 
not an option for us, and that will not 
happen. 
We are all pledging to make sure that 
we resolve this before Christmas or we 
are not going home. But we can do bet-
ter than that. We don’t need to draw 
this out. We have an opportunity, 
working together, so I encourage those 
who are negotiating. We have provided 
not only a template and a framework, 
but we have really given you consider-
able meat in terms of this legislation. 
My hope is that we are going to have 
good news very, very shortly that will 
allow us to not only address the ur-
gency in response to this COVID pan-
demic but also be able to resolve our 
end-of-year appropriations and other 
matters that we have had working be-
fore this body. 
But as they say, we are running out 
of daylight, so let’s get moving with it. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BRIAN HUGHES 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
speaking of moving, I wanted to take a 
few minutes on the floor this afternoon 
to recognize a couple of individuals 
who are moving on. 
We have heard some floor speeches in 
these past several weeks from col-
leagues who have been with us, some 
for decades, like Senator ALEXANDER, 
Senator ENZI, and some who were with 
us for not quite as long, Senator JONES. 
We have had an opportunity to hear 
from them and to share our thanks, but 
I think we all know that as Members of 
Congress, Members here in the Senate, 
we are as good as our staffs—the staff 
who help guide us, who help give us the 
information, who work with us as we 
not only help to build policy but just 
kind of probe and develop and encour-
age us. The work that our teams do for 
us is considerable, and it is appre-
ciated, and we need to show that 
thanks and appreciation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7577 
December 17, 2020 
I want to talk about two gentlemen 
today, and I want to start first with a 
longtime friend and a longtime mem-
ber of the Senate, a gentleman who has 
provided absolutely outstanding serv-
ice to the Senate and to the State of 
Alaska, and that is Brian Hughes, an 
Alaskan who has worked tirelessly for 
our State. He has served as my staff di-
rector on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee for the past several 
years. 
Brian has been here a long time. In 
my view, he has been kind of a fixture 
on energy issues, and many of you 
know him. 
But Brian is going to be leaving on a 
well-deserved 
sabbatical 
when 
this 
Congress adjourns. He says he is going 
to spend some time with his sister and 
brother-in-law. They have 4-year-old 
twins out in California, and I know he 
dotes on them. 
I am excited for his next steps. He is 
going to figure out where he is going to 
be going next, taking a breather right 
now, which is important. But Brian is 
one of those types of individuals who 
are very humble. He is always giving 
the credit to others. I did not want 
Brian’s Senate service to conclude 
without giving it and Brian himself the 
recognition that he has assiduously 
avoided for years. 
Brian first came to the Senate during 
his college years at Washington State. 
His previous summer jobs were work-
ing up on Alaska’s North Slope and on 
commercial fishing boats. 
In 2004, he qualified for Senator Ted 
Stevens’ intern program. I am very fa-
miliar with Senator Ted’s intern pro-
gram because I, too, was an intern for 
Ted Stevens. Brian was pretty much a 
standout, though. He was there not 
only once, but he participated in two 
successful intern summers. Even before 
he finished his studies in finance, Sen-
ator Stevens said: Why don’t you just 
come back? And Brian, in his char-
acteristic generosity, skipped the fun 
of his final semester and returned in-
stead to Washington, DC, to work full 
time here in the Senate while finishing 
his degree remotely. It was true to 
form for Brian because he is an ex-
traordinarily hard worker. 
It wasn’t only the Alaskans, though, 
who recognized Brian’s talent. Less 
than a year and a half after he had 
come back and with the blessing of 
Senator Stevens, Senator Domenici 
‘‘poached’’ Brian to work on the En-
ergy Committee staff. I had the oppor-
tunity to work with Senator Domenici 
when I first came to the Senate, and so 
I first met Brian at that time. Brian 
came over to the Energy Committee 
with Senator Domenici. He pretty 
much has gone through just about 
every job on the committee. He took a 
brief timeout in 2012 to serve as a 
speechwriter 
for 
Senator 
ROMNEY’s 
Presidential campaign, but other than 
that, he has been there throughout. 
Every step of the way, Brian has dis-
tinguished 
himself 
as 
an 
original 
thinker and a voracious reader. I don’t 
know where he finds the time to do all 
of the reading that he does on top of all 
the work he does. I think he doesn’t 
sleep. He is an eloquent writer and a 
versatile high-achiever. So when I had 
the opportunity in 2017, it was pretty 
much a natural and obvious pick to ap-
point Brian as staff director for the En-
ergy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Com-
mittee. 
During Brian’s tenure, we have had 
some pretty considerable and notable 
successes and victories that I will look 
back on for a long, long time, the ef-
forts that he led relating to develop-
ment and conservation of our natural 
resources and modernizing America’s 
energy laws. Brian oversaw the staff 
work leading to enactment of the Din-
gell Act. He helped ensure that a tal-
ented group of nominees were con-
firmed to their posts in the executive 
branch. He was also very key, very cen-
tral to the small ENR team that draft-
ed the legislation to open up Alaska’s 
1002 Area to responsible oil and gas de-
velopment. 
As we are working to conclude the 
business here in the Congress—knock 
on wood—Brian will be able to add the 
Energy bill to his list of accomplish-
ments as we seek to close that out. 
This is something we have been work-
ing on in the committee now for over a 
dozen years to update and to modernize 
our Nation’s energy policies, and I am 
pleased to be at this point and to know 
that it will be Brian who will be bring-
ing it home for this Energy bill. 
Although Brian has a list of legisla-
tive and administrative wins that 
speak for itself, his true gift, his talent 
is writing and storytelling. For years 
now, when anybody on the Energy staff 
is writing a particular document, they 
take their best work, but they won’t 
just end it there; they go to Brian. 
Every time, without fail, he will take 
their work, and he will move it to the 
next level by adding what they call 
‘‘the Brian gloss,’’ usually driving 
home the point more effectively when 
he throws in an anecdote, a funny 
story, or a joke or whatever, but it is 
just ‘‘the Brian gloss.’’ 
Brian has a little bit of a sense of 
humor. As I say, he works very hard, 
but he doesn’t let the seriousness of 
the work take over. We were working 
on an energy bill back in 2016, and we 
had been on the floor for a couple of 
weeks. There was an amendment that 
was pending for a voice vote, and it had 
to do with wild horses. Just prior to 
the vote, Brian and I were talking in 
the cloakroom, and he jokingly said to 
me: You know, when the ayes and the 
nays are called, you should say ‘‘nay’’ 
like a horse. Of course, I am not going 
to say that on the floor of the Senate. 
So then it came down, and the yeas 
and nays were requested, and I don’t 
know where it came from, but I lit-
erally blurted out ‘‘neighhh’’ without 
realizing that my microphone was on. I 
was leading the bill there. The whole 
Chamber heard it. I turned beet red. I 
looked straight back at Brian, who was 
sitting on the bench with several of his 
staff, just laughing. 
Yeah, Brian, thank you for that one. 
I know that I am going to be looking 
back very fondly on the time Brian 
spent on my team. In part, that will be 
because Brian exemplifies three prin-
ciples to which congressional staff who 
excel consistently adhere. 
The first is that staff must be well 
prepared, honest, and straightforward. 
I have always, always been able to 
count on Brian to just be straight with 
me, ‘‘shoot me straight.’’ He knows the 
facts, good and bad, and he shares them 
no matter what. 
Second is that you have to work hard 
and treat everyone on both sides of the 
aisle with respect and fairness. I think 
Brian’s successes are the direct result 
of the many strong relationships that 
he has forged even as he has relent-
lessly pursued his long list of to-do’s. 
Everyone recognizes that Brian is one 
of those guys who is a workhorse. He is 
not a show horse. 
Finally, the best staff discharge their 
delegated authority wisely and to good 
effect, and Brian really takes that to 
heart. He constantly reminds those 
around him that only Senators are 
Senators, even if sometimes people 
would have it otherwise. 
I have been fortunate enough to have 
been on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee since I came to the 
Senate 18 years ago. It is the best com-
mittee out there. I have been privi-
leged now to chair the committee for 6 
years, and prior to that, I was privi-
leged to be the ranking member on 
that committee for 6 years. Every-
body—everybody—on the ENR Com-
mittee works their tail off. They are 
hard workers. They are an extraor-
dinary team. But I think that work 
ethic is set by our staff directors. I 
have been so blessed to have staff di-
rectors who show and model that work 
ethic, and Brian has done that over the 
years. 
Whether on a late night or an early 
morning call on pending legislation or 
a trip to check up on our volcano moni-
toring systems, Brian has been there at 
my side as an indispensable aide and an 
inspiration to all of my colleagues. He 
really is one of those extraordinary 
staff who helped me refine my think-
ing, hone my voice, multiply my 
strengths, overcome my weaknesses, 
and really helped serve the people of 
Alaska and our country. 
So, Brian, I want to say a very gen-
uine and sincere thank-you for the 
years you have devoted, not just to me 
but the years you have devoted to the 
Senate and the years you have devoted 
to our home State of Alaska and to the 
Nation. I hope that rather than being 
up at 2 a.m. trying to resolve a scoring 
issue, the only things that will be 
keeping you up at night will be the 
Yellowstone supervolcano and your lit-
tle niece and nephew. I will miss your 
leadership, your wit, and your friend-
ship. Brian, I speak for so many here in 
the Senate when I wish you a well-

earned break and a confident and 
bright future. 
I have been blessed to have extraor-
dinary leadership on the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, and I 
am going to miss Brian and so many of 
the team. 
I am not leaving the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee, but I have 
maxed out, termed-out in terms of 
chairmanship or ranking member. So it 
is a different place for me, but I am 
still going to be involved with so many 
who continue to do good, strong things 
on the energy front.

TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL PAWLOWSKI 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, an-
other individual who came to me 
through the energy front, if you will, is 
a gentleman by the name of Michael 
Pawlowski. Most of you who know me 
and know my chief of staff don’t know 
that my chief of staff’s name is actu-
ally Michael Pawlowski because no-
body refers to him as that. They refer 
to him simply as ‘‘Fish’’—no last 
name, just ‘‘Fish.’’ And I think that is 
actually somewhat appropriate for my 
office, where we celebrate a lot of good 
things with fish. I was fortunate to be 
able to share some filets of salmon 
with some colleagues as Christmas ap-
preciation, and I would say nothing 
says ‘‘thank you’’ more than fish. 
This is now my opportunity to say 
thank you to my Fish. 
Fish came to Washington, DC, back 
in 2015, when we brought him on to the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee. Again, all good things come 
through ENR. We brought him back to 
be senior policy adviser in 2015, and he 
served in that capacity until I brought 
him over to be my chief of staff in 2016. 
He has served me here in my personal 
office since that time. 
Fish is an Alaskan through and 
through. His family has lived in Alaska 
for five generations. He was raised in 
Anchorage. He has worked for multiple 
State legislators. He has worked in our 
State government. He has worked on 
budget and energy policies. He was dep-
uty commissioner of revenue. He has 
worked to help build up so many dif-
ferent 
energy 
projects—the 
Alaska 
LNG project. He served on the AIDEA 
board, on the Alaska Energy Author-
ity. 
He has been involved in so many dif-
ferent aspects of what is making our 
State move that when he first agreed 
to come back to Washington, DC, I fig-
ured I would be able to keep him back 
here for just a couple years. Somebody 
with this much potential, somebody 
with this much on the ball—how was I 
possibly going to be able to keep him 
here? I figured out how to do it—just 
make sure he could get back to Alaska 
for work throughout the summer so he 
could do the fishing that he really, 
really wants to do first and foremost. 
But that is just the human, personal 
side of him. What Fish has provided me 
is a view towards relationships and 
how we operate in business and profes-
sional relationships here in the Senate, 
working with different offices. He has 
worked to build relationships because 
he truly and genuinely cares about the 
people he is talking to. He is genuinely 
interested. 
He has taken upon himself the men-
toring of our youngest staff, more par-
ticularly. In the order that we have in 
many of the offices, you have levels of 
seniority, and oftentimes the younger 
staff, those who may have just grad-
uated from college, come to Wash-
ington, DC, and they may be answering 
phones and they may be answering let-
ters, but they don’t feel like they have 
a real say in what is going on in the de-
cisionmaking and are kind of out of the 
loop. And Fish—Fish decided that he 
was going to bring them into the loop 
with what he called ‘‘morning stand- 
ups.’’ They were designed for the young 
legislative correspondents to come on 
in, and we will just kind of tell you 
what is going on. You can ask ques-
tions. We will talk about process. We 
will talk about issues. And they were 
not required meetings but more infor-
mational. I think now everybody comes 
to the morning stand-ups just because 
the communication that goes back and 
forth is so uplifting to so many. 
Because of the relationships and how 
he conducts himself, his level of profes-
sionalism, Fish is respected within the 
business community, the Native com-
munity, and by the political types. He 
has become viewed as one of these 
guys—if you want to talk about pro-
posals where you are looking to bring 
Republicans and Democrats together, 
Fish is there. Fish is part of those dis-
cussions. 
He is engaged with the bipartisan 
chiefs. He works to build those rela-
tionships across the aisle—not because 
he is looking for something but be-
cause he knows that is how we are 
going to get something done. And when 
we can get something done that bene-
fits Alaska, it is ultimately going to 
benefit all. 
He is a brilliant thinker—I mean, 
just a brilliant thinker with a strategic 
mind. He is one of these guys who can 
come up with things that I swear no-
body else has thought about. 
I was reading an article—this is 
something that was published a few 
years ago by a former teacher and men-
tor of his from college, and this is from 
Lynn Paulson. It provides a quote from 
Fish talking about his educational 
background at Alaska Pacific Univer-
sity. He said: I have learned to think 
strategically in a way that is unique 
and invaluable and has allowed me to 
do anything, from developing financing 
for renewable energy programs to nego-
tiating multibillion-dollar deals. 
Lynn Paulson goes on to say that 
Fish ‘‘has the temperament to be in 
the middle of this highly charged and 
polarized arena and to emerge unruf-
fled . . . supremely well informed and 
his trenchant logic.’’ These are words 
that others have used to describe him. 
But when I think about how Fish will 
take an idea—whether it was from a 
constituent when we were working on 
the 2017 tax bill—and provide assist-
ance to our Native corporations to be 
able to better utilize their resources, 
really brainstorming to come up with 
what we now have in law that we refer 
to as settlement trusts—Fish is one of 
those individuals who—you know his 
mind is just on fire all the time. But he 
doesn’t present as ‘‘I have the best 
idea, and you need to listen to me.’’ He 
takes the good from so many. He builds 
and uplifts and empowers, and that is 
good leadership. That is management. 
Fish gets frustrated every now and 
again because not everybody commu-
nicates the way he does. Not everybody 
is a relationship builder. And he will 
say: Pick up the phone. Just go talk to 
the person. This building isn’t that big. 
Put your device aside. Don’t send a 
text. Get up from your desk, and go 
across and talk. 
That may be old school, but let me 
tell you, it has worked extraordinarily 
well for this man. 
I mentioned that Fish’s passion is 
fishing; thus the name. He likes to 
spend a lot of quiet time on the river 
just out where it is cold and it is clear, 
or it is wet and you are with the water 
and you are with the fish, and I think 
it gives him a lot of time to do some 
just deep, deep thinking. He collects 
his thoughts. He is able to process and 
to really dream. So when he comes 
back to the real world where it is busy 
and loud, he has this reserve within 
him that he draws on, and it helps. It 
helps him present these ideas and the 
vision that he is able to articulate. 
But like all good Alaskans, we seem 
to find our way back home, like a 
salmon returning to its stream. And 
Fish is going to be returning. I have no 
doubt he will continue to do great 
things for the people he loves, and I 
think he knows that we love him and 
will miss him, as we will miss Brian 
Hughes and as we will miss so many 
great colleagues who will be leaving us 
at the end of this year. I have taken 
time on the floor today to recognize 
some of those individuals who make us 
as Members stronger and better able to 
do the jobs we do. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7579 
December 17, 2020 
As I have been saying, families across 
the Nation have waited far too long al-
ready for another significant dose of 
assistance. We must not slide into 
treating these talks like routine nego-
tiations to be conducted at Congress’s 
routine pace. 
So we need to complete this work, 
and we need to complete it right away. 
That is what I have said. The Senate is 
not going anywhere until we have 
COVID relief out the door. We are stay-
ing right here until COVID relief is out 
the door. 
In the meantime, we are going to 
stay productive while these negotia-
tions are going on. So for the informa-
tion of all of my colleagues, we should 
expect continued votes on nominations 
throughout the weekend. We will con-
tinue accomplishing other aspects of 
the people’s business—confirming well- 
qualified 
nominees 
to 
important 
posts—until we can act on the major 
rescue package the American people 
deserve.

f 
IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH 
ACCESS FOR STUDENTS ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, sui-
cide is the second leading cause of 
death for youth and for young adults 
aged 10 to 34. It is also the second lead-
ing cause of death among college stu-
dents. Thirty-nine percent, in fact, of 
college students experience a signifi-
cant mental health issue, and 50 per-
cent of mental health issues begin by 
age 14. Seventy-five percent of them 
begin by age 24. 
Senators CORNYN, JONES, WARREN, 
GILLIBRAND, ROSEN, and I have intro-
duced the Improving Mental Health Ac-
cess for Students Act. There is com-
panion legislation in the House that is 
also bipartisan that has 51 cosponsors. 
Our legislation is pretty simple. It 
would require colleges that participate 
in Federal student aid programs to 
share contact information for suicide 
prevention resources with their stu-
dents, and this is how it works: 
If a university distributes student ID 
cards—most do; not all of them do but 
most do—then the universities would 
be directed to include the phone num-
bers for the National Suicide Preven-
tion Lifeline, for the Crisis Text Line, 
and for a campus mental health center 
or program on the student ID card. If a 
university doesn’t have a student ID 
card, they don’t have to publish a stu-
dent ID card just for that purpose. 
They can put the information on their 
websites. 
The 
National 
Suicide 
Prevention 
Lifeline is well known. It is a national 
network of over, I think, 180 local cri-
sis centers. Those centers provide con-
fidential emotional support to anybody 
in a suicidal crisis or emotional dis-
tress. They offer 24/7 services, and 
those services are free. 
I would also point out that our legis-
lation is also supported by the Amer-
ican Foundation for Suicide Preven-
tion, the National Alliance on Mental 
Illness, the National Association of 
School Psychologists, and 14 other 
mental health-related organizations. 
Our legislation, finally, would not 
take effect until 1 year. So I don’t want 
anyone to think that we are requiring 
our colleges to go out and immediately 
publish new student IDs. As they pub-
lish new student IDs when the current 
year runs out, we are just asking them 
to include this information on those 
IDs. 
Toward that end, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions be discharged 
from further consideration of our legis-
lation, S. 1782, and that the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1782) to add suicide prevention re-
sources to school identification cards. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
know of no further debate on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate on the bill, the bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass? 
The bill (S. 1782) was passed, as fol-
lows: 
S. 1782 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving 
Mental Health Access for Students Act’’.

call the roll. 
(Mr. KENNEDY assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). Without objection, 
it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO THE TEXAS 
DELEGATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at the 
end of each Congress, we have the bit-
tersweet task of saying good-bye to 
some of our retiring colleagues, and 
today I want to talk a little bit about 
our departing Members of Team Texas. 
When I came to the Senate, suc-
ceeding Senator Phil Gramm, Senator 
Kay Bailey Hutchison, now our Ambas-
sador to NATO, always schooled us on 
Team Texas and said: We may be 
Democrats, we may be House Members, 
we may be Republicans, we may be 
Members of the Senate, but when it 
comes to Texas, we are all part of 
Team Texas. 
And I tried to carry that tradition on 
as well. 
Our delegation is losing six incred-
ible statesmen, including three ranking 
Members in the House, whose contribu-
tions have notched countless wins for 
our State during their time in Con-
gress. 
TRIBUTE TO MAC THORNBERRY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the first 
name I want to mention is MAC THORN-
BERRY. MAC is the dean of the Texas 
delegation. His district is the second 
largest in Texas, and comprises parts 
of 41 different counties. It stretches 
from the suburbs of Dallas, across 
Wichita Falls, Amarillo, and most of 
the Texas Panhandle. 
The 
folks 
throughout 
Texas 
13 
couldn’t have asked for a stronger ad-
vocate over these last 26 years than 
MAC. His background as a rancher, a 
former Capitol Hill staffer, and a State 
Department official under the Reagan 
administration, then brought him to 
Congress with a well-rounded view of 
the problems facing our country. He 
possessed the leadership characteris-
tics needed to address each of those. 
He spent his time here consistently 
fighting to rein in government spend-
ing—something that, as the Presiding 
Officer knows, sometimes seems like a 
futile task but necessary. 
He has consistently fought to protect 
our freedoms and liberties and ensure 
that all Texans have a shot at the 
American dream. 
We have worked together many times 
over the years on everything from pro-
tecting the property rights of folks 
along the Red River to renaming the 
Amarillo courthouse after a trail-
blazing Texan, Mary Lou Robinson. 
There is no question that some of his 
greatest accomplishments are related 
to our national defense. MAC has served 
on the House Armed Services Com-
mittee throughout his time in Con-
gress, and he became the first Texan of 
either party to chair that committee. 
He has used this important and power-
ful post to ensure that our servicemem-
bers have what they need to defend our 
freedoms abroad and the training and 
the equipment to make it home safely. 
He has done a lot—more than most— 
to improve military readiness, includ-
ing through needed improvements at 
our Texas military installations. I re-
member visiting Sheppard Air Force 
Base in MAC’s district with him a cou-
ple of years ago and being taken aback 
by the look of admiration and appre-
ciation on the faces of those airmen we 
encountered who knew of MAC’s incred-
ible advocacy on their behalf. 
It is appropriate that the National 
Defense Authorization Act that just 
passed both Chambers of Congress car-
ries his name—the MAC THORNBERRY 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
There could not be a more fitting trib-
ute to the countless ways our friend 
from Clarendon has improved our great 
country. 
I want to thank MAC for his incred-
ible leadership, as well as his service 
and his friendship over the years. The 
halls of Congress won’t be the same 
without him, but I know he is eager to 
spend more time with his wonderful 
wife Sally and the rest of their ex-
tended family. 
MAC has done what we all aspire to 
do, and that is to leave Congress better 
than he found it, and I thank him on 
behalf of all Texans for the true patriot 
that he is. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO WILL HURD 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we 
like to say, everything is a little bit 
bigger in Texas than the rest of the 
country, and that is true not only of 
MAC’s district but also the largest con-
gressional district represented by an-
other one of our departing colleagues, 
WILL HURD. WILL was a former CIA of-
ficer when he was elected to the House 
of Representatives in 2014. One Texan 
aptly observed: ‘‘He has been running a 
marathon like a sprint for seven 
years.’’ 
I think WILL’s last congressional race 
he won by 900 votes in this sprawling 
border district. 
His expertise is in cyber security, as 
well as intelligence matters. He has 
helped steer our efforts to bolster our 
national 
security, 
counterterrorism, 
and strengthen our intelligence com-
munity and capacity. 
Considering his district includes 800 
miles of our southern border, you can 
imagine that he has been a strong ad-
vocate for our border communities. We 
have worked together on cross-border 
trade, modernizing our ports of entry, 
and ensuring communities along the 
border are safe and prosperous. 
We have also been working together 
on establishing a national museum of 
the American Latino here in Wash-
ington, and I hope we will be able to 
push this authorization bill over the 
line here in the coming days. 
Unlike some folks whom we meet in 
Washington who seem to be all talk 
and who never seem to listen, WILL un-
derstands the importance of sitting 
down for a conversation with his con-
stituents and actually listening to 
what they have to say. He launched the 
highly popular ‘‘DC to DQ tour,’’ where 
he met with constituents at local 
Dairy Queens in all 29 counties in his 
district in only 5 days. 
For everything from healthcare to 
education, to veterans affairs, Texans 
can sit down with their Congressman 
and have a real conversation about the 
things that counted for the most in 
their lives and the things they would 
like to see him pursue on their behalf 
here in Washington, DC. 
I would hate to know how many Bliz-
zards WILL ate during that time, but 
these conversations certainly drove his 
policymaking and ensured the people 
of the Texas 23rd were truly heard here 
in Congress. 
Last year, WILL and I both took part 
in San Antonio’s annual Martin Luther 
King, Jr., March, which is one of the 
largest in the country. WILL happens to 
be the only Black Republican in the 
House of Representatives and has be-
come a trusted voice for those whose 
experience and ideas are too often 
overlooked or underrepresented. 
That has been especially true over 
the last several months, when we have

had an honest national conversation 
about racial reconciliation and injus-
tice in this country, and I know that he 
will continue to use his voice as a force 
for good long after leaving Congress. 
WILL has been a steady hand in re-
minding our colleagues alike that good 
policies should always come before par-
tisan politics, and it is fair to say we 
need more leaders like that in Congress 
these days, not fewer. 
I am grateful for his friendship and 
service to our country, and I know this 
isn’t the end of the road for WILL HURD. 
I am eager to see where his next career 
takes him, and I will be happy to cheer 
him along the way. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE CONAWAY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, much of 
the area that is sandwiched between 
MAC and WILL’s two districts is rep-
resented by another retired Member of 
our delegation, MIKE CONAWAY. Before 
finding his way into public service, 
MIKE served our country in the Army 
and was stationed at Fort Hood. But he 
quickly made his way to the Permian 
Basin and built a successful career in 
the private sector before getting in-
volved with politics. 
During his 16 years in Congress, he 
has represented the folks of Texas 11 
and burned the candle at both ends in 
the process of doing so. 
MIKE is a man of faith, believes in 
the right to life, and is an advocate for 
a strong defense and has been a cham-
pion for our Nation’s veterans. 
His background as a CPA—we could 
use a few more of those, maybe less 
lawyers. But his background as a CPA 
has helped drive debates on our Na-
tion’s spending habits, and I know his 
expertise in this area will be deeply 
missed. 
I believe MIKE would agree that at 
the top of his mountain of achieve-
ments are those for our farmers and 
ranchers. He authored the 2018 farm 
bill, which provides the support, cer-
tainty, and stability for our farmers 
that they need in order to operate in a 
modern 
economy. 
This 
legislation 
strengthened crop insurance, created 
seed cotton eligibility for the farm bill 
safety net, and helped counter cattle 
tick fever and other animal risks. 
It would have been tough for Texas 
farmers and ranchers and producers to 
make it through these times but for 
MIKE as the lead agriculture policy-
maker in Congress. The halls of Con-
gress will not be the same without him, 
but MIKE’s contributions, his leader-
ship, and devoted service will never be 
forgotten. 
I know he and his wife Suzanne are 
eager to spend more time at home with 
their extended family, and I wish them 
a happy and well-deserved retirement. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO KENNY MARCHANT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it seems 
like we have a lot of Texans leaving 
Congress, and one of those is KENNY 
MARCHANT. 
KENNY is a genuine statesman, quiet 
but serious and effective, and he has 
devoted almost his entire career to 
public service. He started out on the 
Carrolton City Council and then be-
came mayor and then spent nine terms 
as a State representative, and, finally, 
eight terms in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. 
And 
he 
proudly 
rep-
resents North Texans and has for the 
last four decades. 
As a Member of the Ways and Means 
Committee, he has played an integral 
role in the effort to keep taxes down, 
including passage of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act in 2018, which was part of the 
spur of our great economic growth 
leading up to the pandemic. 
He has been a staunch supporter of 
efforts to reduce government waste and 
ensure that Congress is a responsible 
steward of taxpayer dollars. He has 
fought for our servicemembers, vet-
erans, and for strong national defense. 
As the top Republican on the House 
Ethics Committee, KENNY
helped to 
strengthen transparency and public 
confidence in our government, and 
there couldn’t be a more important 
time for such a lofty goal. 
I know KENNY is eager to spend more 
time at home with his wife Donna, 
their kids, and a growing gaggle of 
grandkids. Most of their children are 
grown 
now, 
but 
the 
number 
of 
grandkids seems to be increasing in 
pace. 
I want to thank him for his incred-
ible contributions to our State and 
wish him the best in the next chapter. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BILL FLORES 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
House will lose a true class act and the 
epitome of a self-made success with the 
retirement of Congressman BILL FLO-
RES. At just 9 years old, Congressman 
FLORES began tending to cattle with 
his dad in the Texas Panhandle, and he 
hasn’t quit working since. 
He is a ninth generation Texan, rep-
resenting Waco, College Station, and 
parts of North Austin and Pflugerville. 
You would be hard-pressed to find a 
more 
deeply 
divided 
district 
than 
Texas 17, and I don’t mean divided in 
terms of politics or geography. You 
have the Aggies, the Bears, and the 
Longhorns—three of Texas’s proudest 
fan bases—squeezed into one congres-
sional district. Ever the diplomat, BILL 
considers himself tripartisan. Although 
he is an Aggie himself, he would gladly 
throw up the ‘‘Hook ‘em Horns’’ or the 
‘‘Sic ‘em Bears.’’ 
Throughout his time in Congress, I 
have been proud to work with BILL on 
a number of shared priorities. We 
teamed up on legislation to designate 
the Waco Mammoth site as a national 
monument. We worked together to re-
name the Waco Veterans Affairs Med-
ical Center after World War II Hero 
Petty Officer Doris Miller. 
We both had the pleasure of attend-
ing the long overdue Purple Heart cere-
mony honoring the victims of the Fort 
Hood attack after a long fight here in 
Congress to give these heroes the rec-
ognition and the benefits they deserve. 
BILL has been a reliable advocate for 
our veterans and servicemembers, as 
well as our energy industry and our 
free enterprise system, in general. 
I want to thank him for his service to 
our State and to our Nation and wish 
him and Gina the best in the next 
chapter of their lives. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PETE OLSON 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, finally, 
I would say last, but certainly not 
least, is my friend, my former chief of 
staff, and proud Representative of 
Texas 22, PETE OLSON. As the old say-
ing goes, Pete wasn’t born in Texas, 
but he got there as fast as he could. 
His family moved from Washington 
State to Texas when PETE was only 10 
years old. He grew up in Seabrook. He 
went to Rice for his undergraduate de-
gree and UT for law school and hardly 
left the Lone Star State until he en-
listed in the Navy. 
As a Navy pilot, he flew missions all 
over the world, and he was eventually 
brought to the U.S. Senate as a naval 
liaison. 
I had the good fortune of meeting 
PETE
because he worked for Phil 
Gramm, my predecessor, and he had a 
stellar reputation, likely due to his 
Navy days of making the ships run on 
time. 
PETE served as my first chief of staff 
for several years and made it back 
home to Texas before making his own 
run for congressional office. 
His district is literally one of the 
most ethnically diverse in the State 
and one of the most diverse in the 
country. 
PETE
has 
consistently 
prioritized connecting with folks of dif-
ferent backgrounds and cultures to 
learn about the challenges they are 
facing and to figure out how to lead 
positive changes in Congress. 
PETE has been a reliable helping hand 
during some of our toughest times. 
Following the Deepwater Horizon acci-
dent, PETE and I flew several hours 
into the Gulf of Mexico to a drilling rig 
rooted in 9,000 feet of water to learn 
more about the rigors of working on 
offshore rigs. 
After Hurricane Harvey, PETE and I 
joined Team Rubicon’s veteran volun-
teers to muck out some of the flooded 
homes in the Houston area. We fought 
alongside one another to secure the 
funding from Congress to recover and 
rebuild after Hurricane Harvey. 
It was common then to see PETE 
around Capitol Hill with a Houston 
Astros jersey over his dress shirt to 
draw attention—by any means, whatso-
ever—to the need for additional fund-
ing for the folks in his district and 
folks in that region. 
It is safe to say that PETE OLSON’s 
presence has been a constant through-
out my time here in the Senate, and I 
will miss having him just across the 
dome.

December 17, 2020 
Like the others I have mentioned, I 
know PETE is eager to spend more time 
at home in Sugar Land with his wife 
Nancy and his extended family, but I 
hope he knows how much we will miss 
him in Congress. 
If it isn’t already obvious, the Texas 
delegation is losing some truly out-
standing Members, and our new addi-
tions will have some big boots to fill. 
But I just want to tell you how much I 
appreciate the opportunity to express 
my gratitude to each of these six out-
standing Congressmen for their friend-
ship and service to our State and wish 
them and their families well as they 
take on new challenges ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

SAFEGUARD TRIBAL OBJECTS OF 
PATRIMONY ACT OF 2019 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as if 
in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2165) to enhance protections of 
Native American tangible cultural heritage,

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Indian Affairs, with an amendment 
to strike all after the enacting clause 
and insert in lieu thereof the following:

tion 1170 of title 18, United States Code, as 
added by that Act), the Archaeological Re-
sources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470aa 
et seq.), and other relevant Federal laws; 
(7) to exempt from disclosure under section 552 
of title 5, United States Code (commonly known 
as the ‘‘Freedom of Information Act’’)— 
(A) information submitted by Indian Tribes or 
Native Hawaiian organizations pursuant to this

(B) PUBLICATION.—The Secretary, in con-
sultation with Indian Tribes and Native Hawai-
ian organizations, shall publish in the Federal

shall— 
(I) include the definitions of the terms— 
(aa) ‘‘cultural items’’ in section 2 of the Na-
tive American Graves Protection and Repatri-
ation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001); and 
(bb) ‘‘archaeological resource’’ in section 3 of 
the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 
1979 (16 U.S.C. 470bb); 
(II) describe the provenance requirements as-
sociated with the trafficking prohibition appli-
cable to— 
(aa) cultural items under section 1170(b) of 
title 18, United States Code; and 
(bb) archaeological resources under sub-
sections (b) and (c) of section 6 of Archae-

items that do not qualify as Items Requiring Ex-
port Certification and therefore do not require 
an export certification under this subsection, 
which shall clarify that— 
(I) an item made solely for commercial pur-
poses is presumed to not qualify as an Item Re-
quiring Export Certification, unless an Indian 
Tribe or Native Hawaiian organization chal-
lenges that presumption; and 
(II) in some circumstances, receipts or certifi-
cations issued by Indian Tribes or Native Ha-
waiian organizations with a cultural affiliation 
with an item may be used as evidence to dem-
onstrate a particular item does not qualify as an 
Item Requiring Export Certification.

ble for an export certification under this sub-

Certification would not otherwise violate any 
other provision of law; and

permit for excavation or removal authorizes ex-
port; or 
(iii) is accompanied by written confirmation 
from the Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian orga-
nization with authority to alienate the Item Re-
quiring Export Certification that— 
(I) the exporter has a right of possession (as 
defined in section 2 of the Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 
U.S.C. 3001)) of the Item Requiring Export Cer-
tification; or 
(II) the Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian or-

BICENTENNIAL OF LYNNVILLE, 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
over the course of this year, dedicated 
citizens in a small Jackson Purchase 
community have poured through their 
hometown’s historical record. The bi-
centennial of Lynnville, KY, was com-
ing, and they wanted to celebrate every 
detail. Today, it is my privilege to join 
these passionate Kentuckians in mark-
ing 200 years of Bluegrass history and 
heritage. 
Lynnville is no ordinary town. Near 
the Tennessee border in Graves Coun-
ty, this agricultural community has 
survived 
all-consuming 
fires, 
dev-
astating tornadoes, and even the Black 
Patch Tobacco War. Through persever-
ance and grit, Lynnville has certainly 
earned its nickname ‘‘The Little Town 
That Won’t Die. 
For 200 years, stalwart Kentuckians 
have overcome challenges, come to-
gether to rebuild, and made Lynnville 
a wonderful place to live. I am proud of 
their resilient spirit, and I look for-
ward to this community’s bright fu-
ture. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic canceled some 
aspects 
of 
Lynnville’s 
bicentennial 
celebrations, but the Kentucky Histor-
ical Society joined the festivities with 
a special commemoration. They deliv-
ered 
a 
new 
historical 
marker 
to 
Lynnville to detail this community’s 
rich heritage. It is a well-deserved trib-
ute. I am grateful to everyone who 
made the historical marker and this

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ACT OF 
2020 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, before 
joining with my colleagues in an im-
portant colloquy, concerning the Anti- 
Money Laundering Act of 2020, I want 
to applaud Senator GRASSLEY’s tireless 
efforts that spanned years of bipartisan 
work to establish the first whistle-
blower reward program at the Depart-
ment 
of 
the 
Treasury’s 
Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank Chairman CRAPO
and 
Ranking Member BROWN for their work 
on the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 
2020 division contained in this year’s 
NDAA conference report, including the 
important new whistleblower protec-
tions provided in the measure. These 
whistleblower 
protections 
that 
all 
three of us agreed upon, were modelled 
after successful programs that were 
created through the Dodd Frank Act 
for the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission and the Commodity’s and Ex-
change Commission. One key feature 
that makes these programs successful 
is that whistleblowers are guaranteed a 
minimum of 10 percent in awards for 
qualifying disclosures. These rewards 
cost taxpayers nothing because they 
are paid from fines and other monies 
collected as a result of the whistle-
blower’s disclosures. To ensure whistle-
blowers always receive the money 
owed, both the SEC and CFTC, as well 
our original amendment to the NDAA, 
created a special fund that would be 
filled by the fines collected and then 
used to pay whistleblower awards. With 
that, I will be happy to begin the col-
loquy. 
Chairman CRAPO, can you please de-
scribe your intent with respect to 
changes made in the whistleblower pro-
visions in the conference agreement? 
Mr. CRAPO. Certainly. The NDAA 
conference 
agreement 
provides 
for 
whistleblower rewards with a 30 per-
cent maximum of certain monies col-
lected in cases involving Bank Secrecy 
Act violations, but provides for no ex-
plicit minimum award requirement. 
The conferees agreed that updating 
the Bank Secrecy Act’s whistleblower 
incentives and protections was nec-
essary to protect individuals who pro-
vide original information which leads 
to any successful judicial or adminis-
trative 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act 
action 
brought by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury or Attorney General and results in 
monetary 
sanctions 
exceeding 
$1,000,000. 
To accomplish this and to avoid any 
direct spending complications, our in-
tention is to authorize necessary re-
sources and work with appropriators 
and the administration to ensure that 
necessary funding be made available on 
an ongoing basis, that is effectively 
offset by BSA penalties imposed in 
these cases. Such funding will enable 
the Secretary to provide, subject to 
available funds, substantial whistle-
blower awards based upon monetary 
penalties recovered in those whistle-
blower cases. 
It was always the intent of the con-
ferees that these awards to individual 
whistleblowers are important and jus-
tified and that they be substantial, 
such that both a minimum and max-
imum percentage of such monetary 
sanction was contemplated. In this 
case, it is the intent of the conferees, 
in addition to the conference report 
providing for the stated maximum 30 
percent award, to provide for a 10 
prcent minimum award, as both rea-
sonable and sensible. 
Finally, it is the intent of the con-
ferees that no such award should be 
made available to either employees of 
the Treasury Department, the Depart-
ment of Justice, or covered law en-
forcement agencies, if the original in-
formation that led to the successful en-
forcement action is acquired acting in 
the normal course of their job duties. 
We will work with Senator GRASSLEY 
and with administration officials to 
provide for robust minimum awards 
which meet the 10 percent threshold 
wherever appropriate. We will work 
with the Senator in the next Congress 
to draft legislation that addresses the 
important concerns he has raised. 
Does Senator BROWN agree? 
Mr. BROWN. I agree and agree to 
work with Chairman CRAPO and with 
his successor as Banking Committee 
chairman, with Senator GRASSLEY, and 
with appropriate administration offi-
cials consistent with that intent. I 
share the desire to ensure that ade-
quate funds are provided and agree 
that the best way to do so is through 
the creation of a fund that is to be used 
exclusively for the payment of whistle-
blower awards. Such a fund should also 
provide for awards of at least 10 per-
cent of the funds in cases covered by 
the bill. I will work with Senator 
GRASSLEY to make clear that this is 
our intent to administration officials. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank both for 
these clarifications of their intent. I 
look forward to working with them to-
ward these ends.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CATHY HUGHES AND 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
40TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF URBAN ONE 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to ask the Senate to join me in 
recognizing my constituent and friend 
Cathy Hughes on the 40th anniversary 
of Urban One, Inc., formerly known as 
Radio One. Urban One, headquartered 
in Montgomery County, MD, is Amer-
ica’s largest broadcast company pri-
marily focused on African-American 
consumers. Over the last four decades, 
it has elevated and celebrated African- 
American voices while telling stories 
from their perspective. Today, Urban 
One employs more than 1,500 people 
and reaches an estimated 82 percent of 
African-Americans nationwide. 
This remarkable success is attrib-
utable to the skillful and passionate 
leadership of Cathy Hughes. Not long 
after Cathy started her radio career in 
her hometown of Omaha, NE, she found 
herself lecturing at Howard Univer-
sity’s school of communications and 
serving as general sales manager at the 
university’s 
iconic 
radio 
station, 
WHUR. Cathy started Radio One in 1980 
with the purchase of her flagship sta-
tion WOL–AM in Washington, DC, and 
served as its morning show host for 11 
years. As founder and chairwoman, 
Cathy has directed the successful ex-
pansion of Radio One into new radio 
markets nationwide while generating 
original content across the spectrum of 
radio, television, and digital media. I 
am proud to note that Baltimore was 
the first city into which Radio One ex-
panded. 
Urban One’s remarkable 40 years of 
growth are all the more impressive 
given the obstacles that Cathy has 
overcome, not least the racism and 
sexism she has encountered during her 
groundbreaking career. In her initial 
search for financing to buy the station 
that would become Radio One, 32 banks 
rejected Cathy’s bid. 
Cathy has steered her company suc-
cessfully through the changes and chal-
lenges in media markets over the 
years, most recently navigating the 
impact of COVID–19. While Radio One 
itself has been hurt by the pandemic, 
she chose to support her community by 
providing free advertising to Black- 
owned businesses. 
Cathy’s philanthropic work rivals her 
exceptional business achievements. Of 
note is her passion for education, dem-
onstrated by her strong support of the 
Piney Woods School in Piney Woods, 
MS. This school, which her grandfather 
established in 1909, currently serves as 
the largest of four African-American 
boarding schools in the county. Cathy 
has been recognized for extraordinary 
contributions many times over the 
years: National Association of Broad-
casters Hall of Fame in 2019, the 
Woman of the Year Award by 100 Black 
Men of America in 2018, the Ida B. 
Wells Living Legacy Award in 2011, and 
the Essence Women Shaping the World 
Award in 2018. In 2019, Howard Univer-
sity named its school of communica-
tions after her. 
I ask the Senate to join me in recog-
nizing the extraordinary career of an 
extraordinary woman, Cathy Hughes, 
on the 40th anniversary of Urban One.∑

December 17, 2020 
Troop 6, sponsored by St. Frances 
Cabrini Church, has been in existence 
since 1967. When Mr. O became. scout-
master, it had about 12 Scouts; today 
that number is between 60 and 70. Mr. 
O, the founding partner in the Alexan-
dria CPA firm Oestriecher & Company, 
CPAs, has received the Distinguished 
Public Service Award by the Louisiana 
CPA Society and the American Insti-
tute of Certified Public Accountants. 
He has been honored with many awards 
from the Scouting community as well 
as other local organizations. Mr. O has 
led trips to destinations like Philmont 
Scout Ranch and Canada Canoe trips, 
as well as taught other adult leaders 
across the Nation and represented the 
area at four national Scout jamborees. 
Now, his oldest scouts are in their 60s, 
but he is still there as scoutmaster. He 
has several ‘‘grandscouts,’’ whose fa-
thers were members of troop 6 under 
him, and one ‘‘great-grandscout,’’ who 
shared the same scoutmaster as his 
grandfather. Troop 6 has had over 160 
Eagle Scouts during his tenure scout-
master and six of his Scouts have been 
ordained as Catholic priests. He cer-
tainly lives the Scout Law every day 
and epitomizes the troop 6 motto 
‘‘Optimus Optimorum’’—Best of the 
Best. We thank Mr. O for his dedication 
to being scoutmaster and being a good 
influence on so many young men in his 
community.∑

RECOGNIZING AUNT CATFISH’S ON 
THE RIVER 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Committee on Small Busi-
ness and Entrepreneurship, each week I 
recognize a small business that exem-
plifies the American entrepreneurial 
spirit that drives our economy. It is 
my privilege to recognize a family- 
owned small business committed to in-
vesting in its community. This week, it 
is my pleasure to honor Aunt Catfish’s 
on the River, of Port Orange, FL, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
A long-time resident of Port Orange, 
Jim followed in the Galbreath family 
tradition 
of 
entrepreneurship. 
His 
mother, Ann Galbreath, founded and 
ran a restaurant called Marko’s Drive- 
In in the 1950s. After it closed briefly, 
Jim bought Marko’s and reopened it. 
Building on his experience, Jim used an 
old fishing dock to open a new res-
taurant in 1979, Aunt Catfish’s on the 
River. 
More than 40 years later, Aunt 
Catfish’s on the River is still family- 
owned 
and 
operated. 
Jim’s 
son, 
Brendan Galbreath, who started as a 
teenager, took the helm, keeping the 
business in the family. Under his lead-
ership, Aunt Catfish’s has stayed true 
to its reputation for outstanding serv-
ice and delicious cuisine. 
The Galbreath family’s focus on 
building 
strong 
relationships 
with 
their community is a key part of their 
success. During the coronavirus pan-
demic, Aunt Catfish’s opened a drive- 
through operation and expanded its 
carryout services. Brendan served on 
the Port Orange South Daytona Cham-
ber of Commerce/City of Port Orange 
Reopening Task Force, working with 
local business owners, civic leaders, 
and public health experts. Together, 
they designed and implemented the 
Port Orange Phase One Reopening 
Plan, enabling their community to re-
open 
safely. 
Additionally, 
Aunt 
Catfish’s on the River participated in 
the chamber’s ‘‘I Am, I Go, I Support 
Local’’ campaign to support local busi-
nesses. 
Like many Florida small businesses, 
Aunt Catfish’s on the River experi-
enced a sharp drop in revenue due to 
the coronavirus pandemic. In April 
2020, the U.S. Small Business Adminis-
tration launched the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, a small business relief 
program that I was proud to author. 
The PPP provides forgivable loans to 
impacted small businesses and non-
profits who maintain their payroll dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. Aunt 
Catfish’s on the River used their PPP 
loan to keep their employees paid, 
while maintaining the highest health 
and safety standards for their cus-
tomers. 
Aunt Catfish’s on the River is a nota-
ble example of the endurance and resil-
ience of family-owned small businesses. 
Through their advocacy and service, 
Aunt 
Catfish’s 
on 
the 
River 
has 
strengthened their local small business 
community. 
Congratulations 
to 
Brendan and the entire team at Aunt 
Catfish’s on the River. I look forward 
to watching your continued growth and 
success.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–266. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana congressional delegation to take 
such actions as are necessary to fully fund 
the Livestock Indemnity Program in re-
sponse to the negative impact created by 
losses to the Louisiana livestock industry as 
a result of Hurricane Laura and Hurricane 
Delta; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 24 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura made landfall 
along the coast of Louisiana on August 27, 
2020, as a category four storm, becoming the 
strongest storm in Louisiana history and 
causing an estimated ten billion dollars in 
damage from the southwestern to the north-
ern part of the state; and 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura created an esti-
mated one billion six hundred million dollar 
loss to the Louisiana agriculture industry, 
including a loss of one million eight hundred 
thousand dollars to the livestock sector 
alone; and 
Whereas, an estimated one hundred one 
thousand poultry, one hundred thirty cattle, 
and a dozen horses died as a direct result of 
the storm and the extreme health and insect 
conditions that followed; and 
Whereas, Louisiana was hit directly by 
Hurricane Delta on October 9, 2020, causing 
more catastrophic damage to many of the 
same areas of the state as Hurricane Laura; 
and 
Whereas, Hurricane Delta likely created 
numerous additional losses to the Louisiana 
agriculture industry, including livestock, 
the extent of which will only be known after 
surveys and research of the industry can be 
conducted; and 
Whereas, the 2014 Farm Bill authorized the 
Livestock Indemnity Program, within the 
United States Department of Agriculture, to 
provide benefits to eligible livestock owners 
or contract growers for livestock deaths in 
excess of normal mortality caused by eligi-
ble loss conditions, including adverse weath-
er, disease, and attacks; and 
Whereas, the United States Congress ne-
glected to fund the Livestock Indemnity 
Program 
properly, 
creating 
a 
situation 
where Louisiana livestock producers are un-
able to utilize the program at a time when it 
is needed most to offset losses created by 
Hurricane 
Laura 
and 
Hurricane 
Delta. 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress and the Louisiana congressional 
delegation to take such actions as are nec-
essary to fully fund the Livestock Indemnity 
Program in response to the negative impact 
created by losses to the Louisiana livestock 
industry as a result of Hurricane Laura and 
Hurricane Delta; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–267. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to take 
such actions as are necessary to pass a stim-
ulus plan that includes funds for unemploy-
ment, housing, local government, struggling 
businesses, education, and health care; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 30 
Whereas, since surging around the globe 
into a worldwide pandemic earlier this year, 
the COVID–19 virus has taken an enormous 
economic and human toll across countries 
and continents, crippling heretofore healthy 
citizens and industries; and 
Whereas, to help states with costs for 
COVID–19 mitigation and response measures, 
the United States Congress passed the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act; and 
Whereas, measures designed to protect the 
health and safety of Louisiana’s populace 
from the COVID–19 virus have also had a 
negative impact on the economic fortunes of 
many of those same citizens through lost or 
reduced income from closures, capacity re-
strictions, and other public health measures; 
and 
Whereas, the cost of this highly infectious 
pandemic to Louisiana businesses, citizens, 
and local and state government continues to 
rise; and 
Whereas, the unprecedented number of un-
employment insurance claims due to COVID– 
19 has drained the state’s previously robust 
unemployment insurance trust fund; and 
Whereas, local revenue collections have 
plummeted as economic activity has slowed, 
and as a result, local governments are strug-
gling to provide crucial services; and 
Whereas, already made vulnerable by lost 
jobs or decreased income from the COVID–19 
pandemic, many Louisiana citizens face the 
prospect of housing insecurity as they strug-
gle to provide a safe and secure place for 
themselves and their families to live while 
also maintaining basic services such as 
water, electricity, and food; and 
Whereas, the federal government provided 
unemployment and housing assistance in its 
last COVID stimulus package, but there is a 
great need for further economic relief. 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to pass a stimulus plan that includes 
funds for unemployment, housing, local gov-
ernment, struggling businesses, education, 
and health care; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Ms. CORTEZ MASTO): 
S. 5041. A bill to establish the Advi-
sory Committee on Climate Risk on 
the 
Financial 
Stability 
Oversight 
Council; to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Addressing 
Climate Financial Risk Act,’’ which I 
introduced today. 
BACKGROUND 
The average global temperature has 
increased by over 3 degrees Fahrenheit 
in parts of my home State of California 
over the last century, and 2020 is on 
track to be the hottest year on record. 
Climate change is driving the increas-
ing frequency and severity of wildfires, 
floods, droughts, and other natural dis-
asters and extreme weather events. 
In California, wildfires in particular 
have become a major annual concern. 
This year alone, wildfires have burned 
4.1 million acres of California forests 
and destroyed more than 10,000 struc-
tures, including more than 5,000 homes. 
The damage and risk generated by 
these 
events—in 
addition 
to 
the 
changes needed to transition to a 
lower-carbon economy—threaten to se-
verely disrupt real estate values in 
high-risk areas, make insuring against 
risk 
increasingly 
unaffordable, 
and 
dramatically change whole sectors of 
the economy. 
NEED FOR LEGISLATION 
Unfortunately, U.S. Federal financial 
regulators have not done enough to en-
sure that they fully understand and are 
appropriately acting on the risk that 
climate change poses to the stability of 
the U.S. financial system. 
Therefore, I believe there are a series 
of simple steps we should take to en-
sure that U.S. financial regulators are 
well-equipped to mitigate climate fi-
nancial risk. 
This bill would make five main im-
provements to the U.S. financial regu-
latory system. 
First, it would establish a permanent 
committee on the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council (FSOC)—which Con-
gress has charged with identifying 
risks to the U.S. financial system— 
made up of experts in climate science, 
climate economics, and climate finan-
cial risk. 
This committee would assist FSOC in 
publishing a report that assesses the 
ability of the U.S. financial regulatory 
system to mitigate climate financial 
risk and makes recommendations for 
improving its ability to do so. 
Second, the bill would require each 
Federal bank and credit union regu-
latory agency to update its supervisory 
guidance to include climate financial 
risk, and to develop a strategy to iden-
tify and mitigate climate financial 
risk. 
Third, the bill would require FSOC to 
specify how it will take climate finan-
cial risk into account when making de-
cisions on whether to subject nonbank 
financial firms to additional oversight 
by the Federal Reserve Board. 
Fourth, the bill would mandate a re-
port from the Federal Insurance Office 
on how to modernize and improve the 
regulation of climate financial risk in-
surance 
regulation 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Finally, the bill would express the 
sense of Congress that climate change 
is a global problem, and that U.S. fi-
nancial regulators should join inter-
national organizations focused on ad-
dressing climate financial risk and 
work with financial regulators in other 
countries to the extent possible and 
consistent with U.S. law. 
CONCLUSION 
Climate change is real. It’s hap-
pening now and it will have a profound 
effect on our financial system if we 
continue to do nothing. We must act to 
ensure that federal financial regulators 
have expertise in climate financial risk 
and develop approaches to mitigate 
that risk. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor. 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself 
and Mr. ALEXANDER): 
S. 5045. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 and the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 to reform the treatment of multi-
employer plans, to ensure the ability of 
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpora-
tion to provide guaranteed benefits of 
retirees, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 
late June, I came to the floor to speak 
about the need to fix the multiem-
ployer pension system and how that 
system is failing its employees and re-
tirees. I spoke about the need to secure 
retirement benefits for the millions of 
Americans who will start to see plans 
fail and benefits cut in the coming 
years if Congress doesn’t fix this prob-
lem. 
For the past 2 weeks, Chairman 
ALEXANDER
and I were negotiating 
with our Democratic colleagues to do 
just that—fix the system so future re-
tirees and retirees now would not lose 
out on what they were promised. Those 
negotiations were very constructive, 
and I believe that both sides worked in 
good faith. While both sides agreed to 
make significant changes, in the end, 
we weren’t able to find a compromise 
that satisfied our respective principles 
and objectives for resolving this situa-
tion. 
Here is the hang up—time. Now at 
the end of the session, with the end-of- 
the-year agenda and adjournment of 
the Congress, we just ran out of time. 
So in the midst of yearend appropria-
tions and COVID relief negotiations, 
there simply wasn’t enough time to 
reconcile our differences on how to fix 
this failing system. 
My hope had been to use the last 8 
months to negotiate a solution in a 
thoughtful and measured manner, in-
stead of like now, in the heat of a com-
plex yearend bill. But sadly, those 8 
months didn’t produce results. 
From the beginning, we have agreed 
that Federal funds will be needed to 
solve the crisis in the short term—yes, 
money from the Treasury for pension 
plans that are in trouble now. But we 
have been equally resolute that re-
forms are essential to ensure the sys-
tem can be self-sustaining in the long 
term. So we were trying to find a 
short-term solution that would involve 
the injection of Federal dollars, but we 
wanted 
a 
long-term 
solution 
that 
would make sure that private pension 
plans were self-sustaining and not rely-
ing upon the Federal Treasury. Other-
wise, taxpayers will be perpetually sub-
sidizing a private sector system of em-
ployee benefit promises. 
Last 
November, 
Chairman 
ALEX-
ANDER and I presented our comprehen-
sive approach to rescue and reform the 
multiemployer pension system, which 
we have been working on and improv-
ing ever since. The product was im-
proved with an amazing amount of 
input from workers, retirees, unions, 
employers, actuaries, academics, plan 
officials, and even members of the gen-
eral public. Something as big as this 
needed to involve all of those people 
being at the table. 
Today, Chairman ALEXANDER and I 
will introduce a revised version of that 
plan, the Chris Allen Multiemployer 
Pension Recapitalization and Reform 
Act. This legislation served as the 
basis for our recent negotiations and is 
the product of years of work with 
Chairman ALEXANDER to produce a se-
rious, responsible plan that can provide 
relief to failing plans and to protect re-
tirees’ benefits. 
It is also designed to ensure the long- 
term solvency of the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation’s multiemployer 
insurance fund, based on the many 
comments and proposals we received to 
the original Grassley-Alexander plan 
released last November. 
We believe this legislation would en-
sure that the PBGC’s multiemployer 
insurance fund remains solvent over 
the long term after the initial rescue of 
the currently failing plans. But, most 
importantly, this legislation would re-
form the system to prevent this from 
happening again. 
I would also like to note that the bill 
is named after Chris Allen, who was a

dedicated member of my Finance Com-
mittee staff, who passed away nearly 1 
year ago at too young of an age. Chris 
poured thousands of hours of work into 
developing, drafting, and perfecting the 
Grassley-Alexander plan. I am grateful 
for all the work that Chris did, and I 
am proud this legislation bears his 
name. 
I am also grateful to Andy Banducci, 
who helped us continue Chris’s work 
while on detail to the committee from 
the PBGC for several months earlier 
this year. His expertise and commit-
ment, especially during the pandemic, 
were essential to bringing this legisla-
tion to completion. 
Lastly, Mark Warren of the Finance 
Committee staff has led my team on 
this very important issue with the help 
of Jamie Cummins. 
This bill would not be possible with-
out their efforts. So I thank Mark, 
Jamie, Andy, and Chris for their dedi-
cated service. 
Let me close by stressing two points 
for my Democratic colleagues. I appre-
ciate the Democrats’ professional and 
good-faith effort to try to find an 
agreement to this important issue. Al-
though we were not able to reconcile 
our differences before the clock ran 
out, we need to carry that work for-
ward, and I remain ready to continue 
that discussion. I want to make clear 
that, while the last 2 years I have been 
chairman of the Finance Committee, I 
won’t be chairman the next 2 years, 
and we will be working under the lead-
ership of the next chairman, Senator 
CRAPO, if Republicans continue to be in 
the majority. 
These issues are not simple, and as I 
said in June, delaying the solution is 
only going to make the whole effort 
more costly. We should continue to 
work together to find a solution for the 
10 million workers and retirees in these 
multiemployer plans. America’s retir-
ees deserve it. 
Mr. President. I ask that the text of 
the bill be printed in the RECORD.

‘‘(2) ELIGIBLE PLANS REQUIRED TO FILE FOR 
PARTITION.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—An eligible multiem-
ployer plan (other than a plan eligible under 
paragraph (1)(B)(i)(II)) shall file with the cor-

application (or, as provided by the corpora-
tion in regulations, not submit such applica-
tion at all). 
‘‘(c) CONDITIONS FOR PARTITION.— 
‘‘(1) RATE OF ACCRUALS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—As a condition of any 
partition under this section, the rate of fu-
ture accruals, during the period beginning on 
the date of the partition order and ending 15 
years after the effective date of the parti-
tion, shall not exceed the lesser of— 
‘‘(i) a monthly benefit (payable as a single 
life annuity commencing at the participant’s 
normal retirement age) equal or equivalent 
to 1 percent of the annual contributions re-
quired to be made with respect to a partici-
pant as of the first day of the first plan year 
that begins after the date of enactment of 
this section; or 
‘‘(ii) the accrual rate under the plan on 
such first day. 
‘‘(B) 
DETERMINATION
OF
EQUIVALENT 
RATE.—The plan sponsor may determine the 
equivalent rate of future accruals based on 
the standard or average contribution base 
units which the plan sponsor determines to 
be representative for active participants and 
such other factors as the plan sponsor deter-
mines to be relevant. Such determinations 
by the plan sponsor may be made on the 
basis 
of 
individual 
active 
participants, 
groups of active participants, or all active 
participants in total. 
‘‘(C) SPECIAL RULE FOR FUTURE ACCRUALS.— 
To the extent that the rate of future accru-
als exceeds the limitation determined under 
this paragraph, the plan sponsor shall adjust 
the rate of future accruals in accordance 
with this paragraph effective as of the date 
of the partition order. 
‘‘(2) ELIMINATION
OF
ADJUSTABLE
BENE-
FITS.—As a condition of any partition under 
this section, the plan sponsor of an eligible 
multiemployer plan shall eliminate all ad-
justable benefits in the nature of an early re-
tirement subsidy (including a subsidized 
early retirement actuarial reduction factor) 
for all participants not in pay status as of 
the date of the partition application. Noth-
ing in this paragraph shall affect the right of 
a participant to receive an unsubsidized 
early retirement benefit. 
‘‘(d) 
SUCCESSOR
PLANS
AND
ORIGINAL 
PLANS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan created by the 
partition order is a successor plan to which 
section 4022A applies. 
‘‘(2) PLAN
SPONSOR
AND
PLAN
ADMINIS-
TRATOR.—The plan sponsor of an eligible 
multiemployer plan prior to partition and 
the administrator of such plan shall be the 
plan sponsor and the administrator, respec-
tively, of the original plan and the successor 
plan created by the partition order. 
‘‘(3) ORIGINAL
PLAN.—The remaining plan 
after benefits have been transferred to the 
successor plan pursuant to the partition 
order is the original plan. Benefit payments 
made by the successor plan shall not con-
stitute a reduction in benefits with respect 
to the original plan. 
‘‘(e) FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
TO SUCCESSOR 
PLANS FROM THE CORPORATION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Upon approval of an ap-
plication filed pursuant to subsection (i), the 
corporation shall provide financial assist-
ance to each successor plan of an eligible 
multiemployer plan. 
‘‘(2) 
NONAPPLICABILITY
OF
REPAYMENT 
RULE.—Financial assistance provided to a 
successor plan pursuant to this subsection 
shall not be subject to the requirements of 
section 4261(b)(2), except that the corpora-
tion may condition receipt of financial as-
sistance under this subsection on reasonable 
terms consistent with regulations prescribed 
by the corporation to prevent abuse of the 
multiemployer plan program or prevent un-
reasonable risk of loss to the corporation. 
‘‘(f) PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS OF ORIGINAL 
PLAN.—For each participant or beneficiary 
of the plan whose benefit or portion thereof 
was transferred to the successor plan, the 
original plan shall pay a monthly benefit to 
such participant or beneficiary for each 
month in which such benefit is in pay status 
following the effective date of such partition 
in an amount equal to the excess of— 
‘‘(1) the monthly benefit that would be 
paid to the participant or beneficiary under 
the terms of the original plan had the trans-
fer of benefits not occurred (taking into ac-
count any applicable benefit reductions or 
plan amendments following the effective 
date of the partition); over 
‘‘(2) the monthly benefit for such partici-
pant or beneficiary that is paid by the suc-
cessor plan. 
‘‘(g) TRANSFER OF BENEFITS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A partition order under 
subsection (a) shall provide for a transfer of 
benefits from the original plan to the suc-
cessor plan in the amount necessary for the 
original plan to be projected to remain sol-
vent indefinitely, as defined in section 
1.432(e)(9)–1(d)(5)(ii) of title 26, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (excluding subparagraph 
(A)(2)), as in effect on the date on which such 
regulations were issued, using actuarial and 
other assumptions to be promulgated by the 
corporation in the regulations described in 
subsection (h)(4). Such transfer amounts 
shall be determined without respect to the 
amount guaranteed under section 4022A. 
‘‘(2) CONSIDERATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—In determining the 
transfer amount under paragraph (1), the 
corporation shall take into account all obli-
gations of the original plan, including the 
payment of benefits required under sub-
section (f) in excess of the amount paid by 
the successor plan and all plan expenses and 
premium amounts. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTION
OF
ASSETS
AND
LIABIL-
ITIES.—The amount of the transfer of bene-
fits shall be based on a projection of plan as-
sets and liabilities to the projected partition 
date, as specified in the partition applica-
tion, and— 
‘‘(i) the projection of plan assets shall be 
based on the fair market value of plan assets 
as of the end of the last plan year preceding 
the date of the application, with appropriate 
adjustments for actual or anticipated plan 
experience through the projected partition 
date; and 
‘‘(ii) the projection of plan liabilities shall 
be based on the participant data used in the 
most recently completed actuarial valu-
ation. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL RULE FOR INSOLVENT PLANS.— 
With respect to an insolvent plan described 
in subsection (b)(1)(A), the corporation shall 
provide financial assistance to the original 
plan, as needed for the plan to pay to each 
participant and beneficiary in the successor 
plan the excess, if any, of— 
‘‘(A) the monthly benefit that would be 
paid to the participant or beneficiary under 
the terms of the original plan, prior to insol-
vency, had the transfer of benefits not oc-
curred (taking into account any applicable 
benefit reductions or plan amendments fol-
lowing the effective date of the partition); 
over 
‘‘(B) the monthly benefit for such partici-
pant or beneficiary that is paid by the suc-
cessor plan. 
‘‘(h) REGULATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The corporation shall 
issue regulations on the requirements for 
partition applications not later than 180 days 
after the date of enactment of this section. 
By regulation, the corporation may assign 
eligible multiemployer plans into groups, 
based on plan size (prioritizing larger plans), 
projected 
date 
of 
plan 
insolvency 
(prioritizing plans expected to become insol-
vent within 5 years), or such other factors as 
the corporation deems appropriate, for deter-
mining when an application for partition 
under this section may be filed. Any regula-
tions issued under this section shall be in-
terim final or final regulations. 
‘‘(2) EFFECT OF NO REGULATION.—If the cor-
poration does not issue regulations within 
180 days after the date of enactment of this 
section, any applications for partition under 
this section filed after the date that is 180 
days after such date of enactment (and prior 
to the date regulations are issued) shall be 
deemed to be approved. 
‘‘(3) RULES FOR DETERMINING PARTICIPANTS 
AND
BENEFICIARIES.—The regulations under 
this subsection shall include rules for deter-
mining which participants and beneficiaries 
are included in the transfer of benefits. 
‘‘(4) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.—The regula-
tions under this subsection shall prescribe 
acceptable actuarial assumptions, for pur-
poses of an application, relating to the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(A) Future investment returns which 
must be consistent with the applicable dis-
count rate under section 304, except that— 
‘‘(i) in no case shall the assumption for fu-
ture returns be less than 5.5 percent for pur-
poses of determining the initial partition 
amount; and 
‘‘(ii) in no case, while the partition amount 
is being determined or while the partition is 
in effect, shall the assumption used for de-
termining adjustments under subsection (j) 
be less than the lesser of— 
‘‘(I) the rate equal to the 24-month average 
of the third segment rate (as defined in sec-
tion 303(h)(2)(C)(iii)), as of the date the deter-
mination is made, without regard to section 
303(h)(2)(C)(iv), increased by 2 percent; or 
‘‘(II) 5.5 percent. 
‘‘(B) Future contribution base units. 
‘‘(C) Future contribution rate increases, 
taking into account the adopted rehabilita-
tion plan. 
‘‘(D) Future withdrawal liability pay-
ments. 
‘‘(E) Future administrative expenses. 
‘‘(F) Mortality. 
‘‘(G) Any other assumptions deemed by the 
corporation to be material.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7595 
December 17, 2020 
‘‘(5) RULES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS.— 
‘‘(A) INFORMATION REQUIRED.—For purposes 
of paragraph (4), when prescribing acceptable 
actuarial assumptions, the corporation shall 
not require a plan sponsor to obtain data or 
other information that a plan sponsor should 
not reasonably be expected to have in its 
possession, unless it can be obtained with 
reasonable effort and expense. 
‘‘(B) ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ASSUMPTION.—For 
purposes of paragraph (4)(B), an assumption 
related to future contribution base units 
shall be considered reasonable and appro-
priate for purposes of the application under 
this section, provided that— 
‘‘(i) if the recent experience of the plan has 
been declining contribution base units, the 
plan actuary may assume future contribu-
tion base units will continue to decline at 
the same annualized trend as over the 5 im-
mediately preceding plan years unless such 
assumption is unreasonable based on criteria 
which may be prescribed by the corporation 
by regulation, and 
‘‘(ii) if the recent experience of the plan 
has been increasing, or neither increasing 
nor decreasing, contribution base units, the 
plan actuary may assume future contribu-
tion base units will remain unchanged in-
definitely, unless such assumption is unrea-
sonable based on criteria the corporation 
may prescribe. 
‘‘(6) DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS GUARAN-
TEES.—The regulations under this subsection 
shall include rules for determining the 
amounts of benefits guaranteed under sec-
tion 4022A, including acceptable methods to 
approximate credited service for participants 
and beneficiaries in pay status where records 
cannot reasonably be obtained by the plan 
administrator. 
‘‘(i) PARTITION APPLICATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—An application for parti-
tion under this section submitted by a plan 
sponsor shall be filed electronically and con-
tain the required information set forth in 
regulations promulgated by the corporation. 
‘‘(2) APPROVAL
STANDARDS.—The corpora-
tion shall approve a partition application if 
the applying plan meets the requirements for 
a partition under this section. 
‘‘(3) EVALUATION OF INITIAL TRANSFER.—In 
reviewing an application under this section, 
the plan shall propose the initial amount of 
the transfer of benefits under the partition 
order that is required under subsection (g)(1) 
and the corporation shall review and modify 
the amount, if applicable, pursuant to its 
regulations. 
‘‘(4) DETERMINATIONS
BY
THE
CORPORA-
TION.— 
‘‘(A) DETERMINATION
OF
INELIGIBILITY.—If 
the corporation determines the plan to be in-
eligible under subsection (b) for a partition 
under this section, the corporation shall no-
tify the plan sponsor in writing of such de-
termination not later than 30 days after the 
application is filed. Such notice shall specify 
the reasons the plan is ineligible for a spe-
cial partition. The applicant plan will have a 
period of at least 60 days, or longer if speci-
fied by the Corporation through regulations, 
to modify its application, which shall be sub-
ject to expedited review by the corporation 
and, for purposes of satisfying the 1-year fil-
ing requirement for special partition, will re-
late back to the date the application was ini-
tially filed. 
‘‘(B) INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS.—If the cor-
poration determines the application by the 
plan sponsor lacks information necessary for 
the corporation to approve or deny the appli-
cation, the corporation shall notify the plan 
sponsor in writing, detailing which compo-
nents are missing, not later than 30 days 
after the application is filed. Nothing in the 
preceding sentence shall prevent the cor-
poration from asking the plan sponsor at a 
later date for additional information nec-
essary to determine the partition amount. 
‘‘(C) FACTUAL SUBMISSIONS BY PLAN SPON-
SOR.—The factual submissions made by a 
plan sponsor in a partition application, in-
cluding participant data and benefit calcula-
tions, shall be presumed to be correct, unless 
clearly erroneous. 
‘‘(j) POST–PARTITION ADJUSTMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) PROCESS FOR ADJUSTMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—After benefits have been 
transferred under the partition order, the 
corporation shall, at least every third year 
thereafter, adjust the transfer of benefits, as 
necessary to enable the original plan to be 
projected to remain solvent indefinitely, 
consistent with limitations on guaranteed 
benefits 
(if 
applicable 
under 
paragraph 
(3)(C)). The adjustments shall be made based 
on such procedures as the corporation shall 
prescribe by regulation. 
‘‘(B) PLANS PROJECTED TO BE INSOLVENT.—If 
the original plan is not projected to be sol-
vent 30 years after any adjustment review 
date (without regard to whether or not an 
adjustment takes place in connection with 
such date), taking into account the adjust-
ments permitted by this paragraph, such 
plan shall electronically file a report with 
the corporation, as the corporation shall re-
quire by regulation. If the plan subsequently 
reports for 3 consecutive years for which an 
adjustment review is conducted that the 
plan is not projected to be solvent 30 years 
after the date of each such adjustment re-
view, the plan shall be terminated. 
‘‘(2) BASIS
FOR
ADJUSTMENT.—The adjust-
ment shall be based solely on, as applicable, 
updated participant data, calculations of 
guaranteed benefits for participants and 
beneficiaries covered under the successor 
plan, contribution experience, current actu-
arial assumptions (if changed since the ini-
tial transfer of benefits), and changes in the 
market value of the original plan’s assets. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATIONS ON ADJUSTMENT.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The corporation shall 
not adjust under paragraph (1) the transfer 
of benefits to provide additional financial as-
sistance if the corporation determines that 
the original plan or the bargaining parties 
committed an abuse of the multiemployer 
program with respect to the original plan or 
otherwise unreasonably took actions (or 
avoided taking actions) with the result that 
there is an increased risk of loss to the cor-
poration with respect to the successor plan 
or the original plan. 
‘‘(B) END OF ADJUSTMENT AUTHORITY.— No 
adjustments under paragraph (1) to the 
transfer of benefits shall be allowed with re-
spect to any plan year beginning 30 or more 
years after the date of the partition. 
‘‘(C) AGGREGATE
LIMITS.—If the initial 
transfer of benefits from the plan under sub-
section (g)— 
‘‘(i) was less than 100 percent of the 
amount of benefits under the plan guaran-
teed under section 4022A for each partici-
pant, any adjustment under paragraph (1) 
shall not result in a benefit for any partici-
pant in the successor plan in excess of 100 
percent of the participant’s guaranteed ben-
efit, determined as of the date of the initial 
transfer; 
‘‘(ii) was equal to or greater than 100 per-
cent of the amount of benefits so guaranteed, 
any adjustment under paragraph (1) shall not 
result in a benefit for any participant in the 
successor plan in excess of the amount of the 
participant’s benefit subject to the initial 
transfer; and 
‘‘(iii) was less than 5 percent of the amount 
of benefits so guaranteed, there shall be no 
adjustment under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(4) TERMINATED
AND
INSOLVENT
PLANS.— 
With respect to an original plan partitioned 
under this section that subsequently is ter-
minated or becomes insolvent, the benefits 
transferred under the partition order shall 
revert to the original plan, the partition 
shall be reversed, and financial assistance 
provided pursuant to the partition order 
shall cease. 
‘‘(5) REGULATIONS.—The corporation shall 
promulgate regulations describing the proc-
ess and requirements for reporting and the 
circumstances under which plans will be ter-
minated in accordance with the provisions of 
section 4041A pursuant to this subsection. 
‘‘(k) PLANS THAT IMPLEMENTED SUSPENSION 
OF BENEFITS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—An eligible multiem-
ployer 
plan 
described 
in 
subsection 
(b)(1)(B)(i)(II) may be approved for a parti-
tion under this section only if it unwinds the 
suspension, and, if applicable, the previous 
partition described in such subsection in ac-
cordance with regulations to be issued by the 
corporation, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of the Treasury. The unwinding of a 
suspension or partition described in such 
subsection must be contingent upon the cor-
poration’s approval of the application for 
partition under this section. 
‘‘(2) TIMING OF UNWINDING OF SUSPENSION OF 
BENEFITS.—In the case of a partition de-
scribed in paragraph (1), the suspension of 
benefits shall be unwound retroactively. 
Benefits shall be restored to pre-suspension 
levels as of the effective date of the partition 
under this section and participants who are 
receiving benefits on the date of enactment 
of this section shall, beginning not later 
than 180 days after the approval of a parti-
tion order under this section, receive a spe-
cial payment, payable over a period not to 
exceed 2 years, equal to the amount of bene-
fits previously suspended as prescribed in 
regulations. Such plans are subject to the re-
quirements of subsection (c). 
‘‘(l) FIDUCIARY PROTECTION.—Plan partici-
pants and beneficiaries shall not have a 
claim under section 409 or section 502 of this 
Act against plan fiduciaries with respect to 
an application for partition assistance made 
in good faith or the allocation of benefit li-
abilities between the successor plan and the 
original plan. 
‘‘(m) EFFECT OF PARTITION ON WITHDRAWAL 
LIABILITY.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A partition order under 
this section is taken into account in deter-
mining withdrawal liability under section 
4201 of an employer that contributes to the 
original plan, provided that the employer re-
mains a contributing employer to the origi-
nal plan (and in compliance with any appli-
cable funding improvement or rehabilitation 
plan) for a period of 15 years following the ef-
fective date of the liability transfer. 
‘‘(2) WITHDRAWALS
AFTER
LESS
THAN
15 
YEARS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—If an employer com-
pletely withdraws or partially withdraws 
from a plan that was partitioned under this 
section at any time within the 15-year period 
described in paragraph (1), the transfer of 
benefits under subsection (g) shall not be 
taken into account in computing the em-
ployer’s complete or partial withdrawal li-
ability, and the amount of the annual with-
drawal liability payment amount otherwise 
determined shall be increased by 10 percent. 
‘‘(B) EXCEPTION.—Subparagraph (A) shall 
not apply— 
‘‘(i) if the complete or partial withdrawal 
is due to a decertification, a change in bar-
gaining representatives, disclaimer of inter-
est, or because of an event described in sec-
tion 4218; or 
‘‘(ii) in the case of a partial withdrawal due 
to a bargaining unit or facility take-out if 
the contribution base units for the plan year 
immediately following the year of the par-
tial withdrawal are at least 97 percent of the

contribution base units for the plan year im-
mediately preceding the year of the partial 
withdrawal. 
‘‘(3) EXCEPTION.— Paragraphs (1) and (2) 
shall not apply to an employer that first had 
an obligation to contribute to the plan parti-
tioned under this section after the date of 
enactment of this section. 
‘‘(n) RESTRICTIONS
ON
BENEFIT
IMPROVE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) INCREASE IN PLAN LIABILITIES.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—If the plan sponsor 
adopts a plan amendment that increases plan 
liabilities (due to any increase in benefits, 
any change in the accrual of benefits, or any 
change in the rate at which benefits become 
nonforfeitable) that takes effect after the ef-
fective date of the partition, the original 
plan shall make payments to the corporation 
for each year during the 20-year period fol-
lowing the effective date of the benefit in-
crease. For purposes of this paragraph, an in-
crease in benefits due to an increase in the 
contribution rate or compensation shall be 
considered a prohibited increase in benefits. 
‘‘(B) EXCEPTION
FOR
CERTAIN
ACCRUALS.— 
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any 
change in future accruals after the end of the 
15-year period during which such accruals 
are limited under subsection (c). 
‘‘(2) AMOUNT
PAYABLE
TO
CORPORATION.— 
The amount paid by the original plan to the 
corporation under paragraph (1) each year 
shall be equal to the lesser of— 
‘‘(A) the total value of the increase in ben-
efit payments for the year that is attrib-
utable to the benefit improvement; or 
‘‘(B) the total benefit payments from the 
successor plan for such year. 
‘‘(3) TIMING OF PAYMENT.—Payments under 
paragraph (2) shall be made by the original 
plan at the time of, and in addition to, any 
premium imposed by the corporation on the 
plan. 
‘‘(4) PBGC AUTHORITY.—The corporation is 
authorized to bring an action against the 
original plan to prevent or correct any and 
all actions by plan sponsors, a principal pur-
pose of which is to evade or avoid payments 
due to the corporation under paragraph (2), 
or that may have the effect of evading or 
avoiding such payments. Payments under 
paragraph (2) shall be determined without re-
gard to such actions by plan sponsors. 
‘‘(5) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN CHANGES.—The 
requirements of this subsection do not apply 
to an increase or change in benefits that is 
required by law or that is a de minimis 
change, as determined by the corporation. 
‘‘(o) 
POST-PARTITION
DISCLOSURES.—Not 
later than 90 days after the first day of each 
plan year beginning after the effective date 
of a partition under this section, the plan

cally file with the corporation a report in-
cluding the following information:

year preceding such plan year, and the rea-
son for such reduction. 
‘‘(9) A list of employers that withdrew 
from the plan in the plan year preceding 
such plan year, and the resulting reduction 
in contributions. 
‘‘(10) A list of employers that paid with-
drawal liability to the plan during the plan

in the payment schedule with respect to such 
withdrawal liability.

stricted 
status

to

305(b)(1)(B), the plan sponsor of an original 
plan may not accept a collective bargaining 
agreement with respect to such original plan 
that includes a reduction in employer con-
tribution rates. 
‘‘(2) EXCEPTION.—Under a process to be pro-
mulgated by regulation by the corporation, a 
plan sponsor of an original plan may petition 
the corporation for the authority to approve 
a collective bargaining agreement that con-
templates a reduction in employer contribu-
tion rates. Such regulation shall include a 
requirement that a plan petitioning for such 
authority demonstrate that its existing con-
tribution rates are higher than contribution 
rates paid on behalf of other workers covered 
by collective bargaining agreements in the 
same industry in nearby localities. The cor-
poration shall approve the petition if the 
plan sponsor demonstrates that the reduc-
tion in contribution rates improves the long- 
term funding or solvency of the plan, and 
does not increase the corporation’s expected 
loss with respect to the plan. 
‘‘(q) EFFECT ON ACCUMULATED FUNDING DE-
FICIENCY.—Any accumulated funding defi-
ciency (as defined in section 304(a)) of a plan 
shall be reduced to zero as of the first day of

gible multiemployer plan described in sec-
tion 4233A(b) that receives a special partition 
under that section.’’. 
(c) CLERICAL
AMENDMENT.—The table of 
contents in section 1 of the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C.

FUNDING METHOD.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—For purposes of this 
part, normal costs, accrued liability, and ex-
perience gains and losses used to determine 
the unfunded past service liability for the 
plan shall be determined under the funding 
method used to determine costs under the

the unit credit funding method or the entry- 
age normal funding method, the normal cost

gate) shall approve such request upon a de-
termination that the change is reasonably 
supported by changes in the financial mar-
kets or changes in the plan’s asset alloca-
tion, and is consistent with the manner in 
which prior changes in interest rate assump-
tions were determined since the date of the 
enactment of this Act.

TUS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which a 
multiemployer plan is in declining status for 
a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance 
with this subsection— 
‘‘(A) shall adopt a solvency plan not later 
than 240 days following the required date for 
the actuarial certification of declining sta-
tus under subsection (b)(5)(A), and 
‘‘(B) within 30 days after the adoption of 
the solvency plan shall provide to the bar-
gaining parties 1 or more schedules showing 
revised benefit structures, revised contribu-
tion structures, or both, which, if adopted, 
may reasonably be expected to enable the 
multiemployer plan to meet the require-
ments of paragraph (3), including— 
‘‘(i) one default proposal under which— 
‘‘(I) all adjustable benefits in the form of 
early retirement subsidies (including early 
reduction factors which are not provided on 
an actuarially equivalent basis) under the 
plan are eliminated, and 
‘‘(II) the future monthly benefit accrual 
rate under the plan is reduced to the equiva-
lent of 1 percent of annual contributions (or, 
if lower, the current accrual rate) based on 
the contribution rate in effect as of the later

partition under section 4233A of the Em-
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of

priate to provide as an alternative to the de-
fault proposal.

ly benefit accrual rate in excess of the rate 
described in subparagraph (B)(i)(II). 
‘‘(2) EXCEPTION FOR YEARS AFTER PROCESS 
BEGINS.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a 
plan year if such year is in a solvency plan 
adoption period or solvency attainment pe-
riod by reason of the plan being in declining 
status for a preceding plan year, except that 
the next update of the solvency plan shall 
fulfill the requirement of paragraph (1)(B)(i). 
For purposes of this section, such preceding 
plan year shall be the initial determination 
year with respect to the solvency plan to 
which it relates. 
‘‘(3) SOLVENCY PLAN.—For purposes of this 
section, a solvency plan is a plan which con-
sists of the actions, including options or a 
range of options to be proposed to the bar-
gaining parties, formulated, based on reason-
ably anticipated experience and reasonable 
actuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to 
delay or avoid the projected insolvency. 
‘‘(4) SOLVENCY
ATTAINMENT
PERIOD.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
subparagraph (B), the solvency attainment 
period for any solvency plan adopted pursu-
ant to this subsection is the period— 
‘‘(i) beginning on the first day of the first 
plan year of the multiemployer plan begin-
ning after the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the second anniversary of the date of 
the adoption of the solvency plan, or 
‘‘(II) the expiration of the collective bar-
gaining agreements in effect on the due date 
for the actuarial certification of declining 
status for the initial determination year 
under subsection (b)(5)(A) and covering, as of 
such due date, at least 75 percent of the ac-
tive participants in such plan, and 
‘‘(ii) ending on the date the plan either 
emerges from declining status or becomes in-
solvent.

LAR BENEFITS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Effective on the date 
the notice of certification of the plan’s de-

sonable and (with the exception of assump-
tions regarding future contributions) rep-
resent the actuary’s best estimate of future 
plan experience, within limitations pre-
scribed by the Secretary. A plan actuary 
shall avoid conservatism or optimism in in-
dividual assumptions to the extent that they 
would result in a set of assumptions that is 
unreasonable in the aggregate.

RETURNS.—The invest-
ment return assumption for projecting plan 
assets may differ from the actuarial valu-
ation interest rate. In selecting the invest-

assets, the plan actuary shall estimate the 
expected return of the plan’s investments as 
currently invested and as expected to be in-
vested in the future, consistent with the 
plan’s adopted investment policy, if applica-
ble. It is reasonable for an actuary to expect 
that the plan’s investment decisions will 
consider risk, expected returns over time, 
and expected future benefit payments. The 
investment return assumption shall not ex-
ceed the interest rate used to determine past 
service liability under section 431(b)(6). 
‘‘(C) CONTRIBUTIONS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The plan actuary shall 
develop assumptions for the projection of fu-
ture contributions, including assumptions 
regarding industry activity among contrib-
uting employers and contribution rates, 
based on information provided by the plan 
sponsor, which must act reasonably and in 
good faith. The plan actuary shall certify the 
reasonableness of all assumptions. 
‘‘(ii) PROJECTED
INDUSTRY
ACTIVITY.—Any 
projection of activity in the industry or in-
dustries covered by the plan, including fu-
ture covered employment and contribution 
levels, shall be based on information pro-
vided by the plan sponsor acting reasonably 
and in good faith. 
‘‘(iii) FUTURE CONTRIBUTION BASE UNITS.— 
‘‘(I) DECLINING CONTRIBUTION BASE UNITS.— 
If recent experience of the plan has been de-
clining contribution base units, the plan ac-
tuary may assume future contribution base 
units will continue to decline at the same 
annualized trend as over the 5 immediately 
preceding plan years, unless the actuary de-
termines that there have been significant 
changes that would make such assumption 
unreasonable. 
‘‘(II) FLAT
OR
INCREASING
CONTRIBUTION 
BASE UNITS.—If recent experience of the plan 
has been increasing, or neither increasing 
nor decreasing, contribution base units, the 
plan actuary may assume future contribu-
tion base units will remain unchanged in-
definitely, unless the actuary determines 
that there have been significant changes 
that would make such assumption unreason-
able. 
‘‘(iv) FUTURE CONTRIBUTION RATES.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—Projections of contribu-
tions shall be based on the contribution 
rates consistent with the terms of collective 
bargaining and participation agreements 
currently in effect. 
‘‘(II) FUTURE
INCREASES
IN
ACCORDANCE 
WITH
CORRECTION
PLANS.—If reasonable and 
applicable, the plan actuary may assume fu-
ture increases in contribution rates con-
sistent with the adopted funding improve-
ment plan, rehabilitation plan, or solvency 
plan. 
‘‘(III) ADDITIONAL
FACTORS.—Information 
provided by the plan sponsor to the plan ac-
tuary in setting the assumption regarding 
future increases in contribution rates shall 
take into account the ability of the partici-
pating employers to make contributions at 
the scheduled rates over time, considering 
relevant factors such as projected industry 
activity, the financial strength of partici-
pating employers, market competition, and 
the scheduled contribution rate to the plan 
relative to the overall wage package. 
‘‘(D) ASSUMPTIONS FOR DEVELOPING SCHED-
ULES.—All schedules under any funding im-
provement plan, rehabilitation plan, or sol-
vency plan must be developed based on the 
same set of actuarial assumptions unless it 
would be unreasonable to do so, taking into 
account the anticipated impact of the sched-
ules on participant behavior and employer 
participation.’’. 
(2) ADDITIONS TO FORM 5500 SCHEDULE MB.— 
Subparagraph (B) of section 432(b)(5) of such 
Code, as redesignated and amended by this 
section, is further amended by adding at the

actuary shall attach to the certification re-
quired under subparagraph (A)—

cation of status under subparagraph (A), in-
cluding projections of the funding standard 
account, funded percentage, and solvency of 
the plan, 
‘‘(II) a clear description of the key assump-
tions used in performing the projections, in-
cluding investment returns, contribution 
base units, and contribution rates, 
‘‘(III) a 5-year history of contributions, in-
cluding contribution base units, average con-
tribution rates, and withdrawal liability 
payments, and a comparison of such con-
tribution base units, rates, and payments to 
projections made by the plan, and 
‘‘(IV) an alternate projection of the fund-
ing standard account, funded percentage, and 
solvency, based on the following assump-
tions: 
‘‘(aa) Annual future investment returns on 
plan assets equal the actuarial interest rate 
assumption minus 1 percent. 
‘‘(bb) Future contribution base units pro-
jected using a trend equal to the lesser of— 
‘‘(AA) the annualized trend of actual con-
tribution base units over the 5 preceding 
plan years, and 
‘‘(BB) no change in future contribution 
base units. 
‘‘(cc) No increases in future contribution 
rates beyond those consistent with the col-
lective bargaining agreements and participa-
tion agreements in effect for the plan year. 
‘‘(dd) The withdrawal from the plan of the 
employer which has contributed the greatest 
total amount of contributions over the 5 pre-
ceding plan years, if such employer has con-
tributed at least 10 percent of the total con-
tributions to the plan over such 5 plan years 
and such employer has a below investment 
grade credit rating (but only if obtaining the 
credit rating of such employer is not an 
undue burden). 
‘‘(ee) If such credit rating cannot be ob-
tained without undue burden, the with-
drawal of the employer which has contrib-
uted the greatest total amount of contribu-
tions over the 5 preceding plan years, if such 
employer has contributed at least 10 percent 
of the total contributions to the plan over 
such 5 plan years without regard to collec-
tion of any withdrawal liability. 
‘‘(ff) If no employer has contributed at 
least 10 percent of the total contributions to 
the plan over the 5 preceding plan years, the

or participation agreement which reduces

any 
participants, 
suspends

spectively, and 
(ii) by inserting after subsection (g), as re-
designated by subsection (a)(2), the following 
new subsections: 
‘‘(h) SOLVENCY PLAN MUST BE ADOPTED FOR 
MULTIEMPLOYER
PLANS
IN
DECLINING
STA-
TUS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which a 
multiemployer plan is in declining status for 
a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance 
with this subsection— 
‘‘(A) shall adopt a solvency plan not later 
than 240 days following the required date for 
the actuarial certification of declining sta-
tus under subsection (b)(5)(A), and 
‘‘(B) within 30 days after the adoption of 
the solvency plan shall provide to the bar-
gaining parties 1 or more schedules showing 
revised benefit structures, revised contribu-
tion structures, or both, which, if adopted, 
may reasonably be expected to enable the 
multiemployer plan to meet the require-
ments of paragraph (3), including— 
‘‘(i) one default proposal under which— 
‘‘(I) all adjustable benefits in the form of 
early retirement subsidies (including early 
reduction factors which are not provided on 
an actuarially equivalent basis) under the 
plan are eliminated, and 
‘‘(II) the future monthly benefit accrual 
rate under the plan is reduced to the equiva-
lent of 1 percent of annual contributions (or, 
if lower, the current accrual rate) based on 
the contribution rate in effect as of the later 
of the first day of the plan year in which the 
plan enters declining status or the date of a 
partition under section 4233A, and 
which may also include reduction or elimi-
nation of any other adjustable benefits under 
the plan, and 
‘‘(ii) any additional schedules which reduce 
or eliminate adjustable benefits under the 
plan which the plan sponsor deems appro-
priate to provide as an alternative to the de-
fault proposal. 
No schedule provided to or adopted by the 
bargaining parties shall provide for a month-
ly benefit accrual rate in excess of the rate 
described in subparagraph (B)(i)(II). 
‘‘(2) EXCEPTION FOR YEARS AFTER PROCESS 
BEGINS.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a 
plan year if such year is in a solvency plan 
adoption period or solvency attainment pe-
riod by reason of the plan being in declining 
status for a preceding plan year, except that 
the next update of the solvency plan shall 
fulfill the requirement of paragraph (1)(B)(i). 
For purposes of this section, such preceding 
plan year shall be the initial determination 
year with respect to the solvency plan to 
which it relates. 
‘‘(3) SOLVENCY PLAN.—For purposes of this 
section, a solvency plan is a plan which con-
sists of the actions, including options or a 
range of options to be proposed to the bar-
gaining parties, formulated, based on reason-
ably anticipated experience and reasonable 
actuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to 
delay or avoid the projected insolvency. 
‘‘(4) SOLVENCY
ATTAINMENT
PERIOD.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
subparagraph (B), the solvency attainment 
period for any solvency plan adopted pursu-
ant to this subsection is the period— 
‘‘(i) beginning on the first day of the first 
plan year of the multiemployer plan begin-
ning after the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the second anniversary of the date of 
the adoption of the solvency plan, or 
‘‘(II) the expiration of the collective bar-
gaining agreements in effect on the due date 
for the actuarial certification of declining 
status for the initial determination year 
under subsection (b)(5)(A) and covering, as of 
such due date, at least 75 percent of the ac-
tive participants in such plan, and 
‘‘(ii) ending on the date the plan either 
emerges from declining status or becomes in-
solvent. 
‘‘(B) COORDINATION
WITH
CHANGES
IN
STA-
TUS.— 
‘‘(i) PLANS
NO
LONGER
IN
DECLINING
STA-
TUS.—If the plan’s actuary certifies in ac-
cordance with subparagraph (C) for a plan 
year in any solvency plan adoption period or 
solvency attainment period that the plan is 
no longer in declining status, the solvency 
plan adoption period or solvency attainment 
period, whichever is applicable, shall end as 
of the date of such certification. 
‘‘(ii) PLANS
IN
CRITICAL
OR
ENDANGERED 
STATUS.—If the plan’s actuary certifies under 
subsection (b)(5)(A) for the plan year de-
scribed in clause (i) that the plan is in crit-
ical or endangered rather than declining sta-
tus, the provisions of subsections (d) and (e), 
or subsections (f) and (g), whichever are ap-
plicable, shall be applied as if such plan year 
were an initial determination year, except 
that the plan may not be amended in a man-
ner inconsistent with the solvency plan in ef-
fect for the preceding plan year until a new 
funding improvement plan or rehabilitation 
plan, whichever is applicable, is adopted. 
‘‘(C) EMERGENCE.—A plan in declining sta-
tus shall remain in such status until a plan 
year for which the plan actuary certifies, in 
accordance with subsection (b)(5)(A), that 
the plan is not described in one or more of 
the subparagraphs in subsection (b)(4) as of 
the beginning of the plan year. 
‘‘(5) UPDATES
TO
SOLVENCY
PLANS
AND 
SCHEDULES.— 
‘‘(A) SOLVENCY
PLAN.—The plan sponsor 
shall annually update the solvency plan and 
shall file the update with the plan’s annual 
report under section 104. 
‘‘(B) SCHEDULES.—The plan sponsor shall 
annually update any schedule of contribu-
tion rates provided under this subsection to 
reflect the experience of the plan. 
‘‘(C) DURATION OF SCHEDULE.—A schedule of 
contribution rates provided by the plan spon-
sor and relied upon by bargaining parties in 
negotiating a collective bargaining agree-
ment shall remain in effect for the duration 
of that collective bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(6) IMPOSITION OF SCHEDULE WHERE FAIL-
URE TO ADOPT SOLVENCY PLAN.— 
‘‘(A) INITIAL CONTRIBUTION SCHEDULE.—If— 
‘‘(i) a collective bargaining agreement pro-
viding for contributions under a multiem-
ployer plan that was in effect at the time the 
plan entered declining status expires, and 
‘‘(ii) after receiving one or more schedules 
from the plan sponsor under paragraph 
(1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to 
such agreement fail to adopt a contribution 
schedule with terms consistent with the sol-
vency plan and a schedule from the plan 
sponsor, 
the plan sponsor shall implement the sched-
ule described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) beginning 
on the date specified in subparagraph (C). 
‘‘(B) 
SUBSEQUENT
CONTRIBUTION
SCHED-
ULE.—If— 
‘‘(i) a collective bargaining agreement pro-
viding for contributions under a multiem-
ployer plan in accordance with a schedule 
provided by the plan sponsor pursuant to a 
solvency plan (or imposed under subpara-
graph (A)) expires while the plan is still in 
declining status, and 
‘‘(ii) after receiving one or more updated 
schedules from the plan sponsor under para-
graph (5)(B), the bargaining parties with re-
spect to such agreement fail to adopt a con-
tribution schedule with terms consistent 
with the updated solvency plan and a sched-
ule from the plan sponsor, 
then the contribution schedule applicable 
under the expired collective bargaining 
agreement, as updated and in effect on the 
date the collective bargaining agreement ex-
pires, shall be implemented by the plan spon-
sor beginning on the date specified in sub-
paragraph (C). 
‘‘(C) DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION.—The date 
specified in this subparagraph is the date 
which is 180 days after the date on which the 
collective bargaining agreement described in 
subparagraph (A) or (B) expires.

by a plan actuary shall be individually rea-
sonable and, in the aggregate, shall be rea-
sonable and (with the exception of assump-
tions regarding future contributions) rep-
resent the actuary’s best estimate of future 
plan experience, within limitations pre-
scribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. A 
plan actuary shall avoid conservatism or op-
timism in individual assumptions to the ex-
tent that they would result in a set of as-
sumptions that is unreasonable in the aggre-
gate. 
‘‘(B) INVESTMENT
RETURNS.—The invest-
ment return assumption for projecting plan 
assets may differ from the actuarial valu-
ation interest rate. In selecting the invest-
ment return assumption for projecting plan 
assets, the plan actuary shall estimate the 
expected return of the plan’s investments as 
currently invested and as expected to be in-
vested in the future, consistent with the 
plan’s adopted investment policy, if applica-
ble. It is reasonable for an actuary to expect 
that the plan’s investment decisions will 
consider risk, expected returns over time, 
and expected future benefit payments. The 
investment return assumption shall not ex-
ceed the interest rate used to determine past 
service liability under section 431(b)(6). 
‘‘(C) CONTRIBUTIONS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The plan actuary shall 
develop assumptions for the projection of fu-
ture contributions, including assumptions 
regarding industry activity among contrib-
uting employers and contribution rates, 
based on information provided by the plan 
sponsor, which must act reasonably and in 
good faith. The plan actuary shall certify the 
reasonableness of all assumptions. 
‘‘(ii) PROJECTED
INDUSTRY
ACTIVITY.—Any 
projection of activity in the industry or in-
dustries covered by the plan, including fu-
ture covered employment and contribution 
levels, shall be based on information pro-
vided by the plan sponsor acting reasonably 
and in good faith. 
‘‘(iii) FUTURE CONTRIBUTION BASE UNITS.— 
‘‘(I) DECLINING CONTRIBUTION BASE UNITS.— 
If recent experience of the plan has been de-
clining contribution base units, the plan ac-
tuary may assume future contribution base 
units will continue to decline at the same 
annualized trend as over the 5 immediately 
preceding plan years, unless the actuary de-
termines that there have been significant 
changes that would make such assumption 
unreasonable. 
‘‘(II) FLAT
OR
INCREASING
CONTRIBUTION 
BASE UNITS.—If recent experience of the plan 
has been increasing, or neither increasing 
nor decreasing, contribution base units, the 
plan actuary may assume future contribu-
tion base units will remain unchanged in-
definitely, unless the actuary determines 
that there have been significant changes 
that would make such assumption unreason-
able. 
‘‘(iv) FUTURE CONTRIBUTION RATES.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—Projections of contribu-
tions shall be based on the contribution 
rates consistent with the terms of collective 
bargaining and participation agreements 
currently in effect. 
‘‘(II) FUTURE
INCREASES
IN
ACCORDANCE 
WITH
CORRECTION
PLANS.—If reasonable and 
applicable, the plan actuary may assume fu-
ture increases in contribution rates con-
sistent with the adopted funding improve-
ment plan, rehabilitation plan, or solvency 
plan. 
‘‘(III) ADDITIONAL
FACTORS.—Information 
provided by the plan sponsor to the plan ac-
tuary in setting the assumption regarding 
future increases in contribution rates shall 
take into account the ability of the partici-
pating employers to make contributions at 
the scheduled rates over time, considering 
relevant factors such as projected industry 
activity, the financial strength of partici-
pating employers, market competition, and 
the scheduled contribution rate to the plan 
relative to the overall wage package. 
‘‘(D) ASSUMPTIONS FOR DEVELOPING SCHED-
ULES.—All schedules under any funding im-
provement plan, rehabilitation plan, or sol-
vency plan must be developed based on the 
same set of actuarial assumptions unless it 
would be unreasonable to do so, taking into 
account the anticipated impact of the sched-
ules on participant behavior and employer 
participation.’’. 
(2) ADDITIONS TO FORM 5500 SCHEDULE MB.— 
Subparagraph (B) of section 305(b)(5) of such 
Act (29 U.S.C. 1085(b)(5)), as redesignated and 
amended by this section, is further amended 
by adding at the end the following new 
clause: 
‘‘(vi) ADDITIONAL ATTACHMENTS.—The plan 
actuary shall attach to the certification re-
quired under subparagraph (A)— 
‘‘(I) documentation supporting the certifi-
cation of status under subparagraph (A)(i), 
including projections of the funding standard 
account, funded percentage, and solvency of 
the plan, 
‘‘(II) a clear description of the key assump-
tions used in performing the projections, in-
cluding investment returns, contribution 
base units, and contribution rates, 
‘‘(III) a 5-year history of contributions, in-
cluding contribution base units, average con-
tribution rates, and withdrawal liability 
payments, and a comparison of such con-
tribution base units, rates, and payments to 
projections made by the plan, and 
‘‘(IV) an alternate projection of the fund-
ing standard account, funded percentage, and 
solvency, based on the following assump-
tions: 
‘‘(aa) Annual future investment returns on 
plan assets equal the actuarial interest rate 
assumption minus 1 percent. 
‘‘(bb) Future contribution base units pro-
jected using a trend equal to the lesser of— 
‘‘(AA) the annualized trend of actual con-
tribution base units over the 5 preceding 
plan years, and 
‘‘(BB) no change in future contribution 
base units. 
‘‘(cc) No increases in future contribution 
rates beyond those consistent with the col-
lective bargaining agreements and participa-
tion agreements in effect for the plan year. 
‘‘(dd) The withdrawal from the plan of the 
employer which has contributed the greatest 
total amount of contributions over the 5 pre-
ceding plan years, if such employer has con-
tributed at least 10 percent of the total con-
tributions to the plan over such 5 plan years 
and such employer has a below investment 
grade credit rating (but only if obtaining the 
credit rating of such employer is not an 
undue burden). 
‘‘(ee) If such credit rating cannot be ob-
tained without undue burden, the with-
drawal of the employer which has contrib-
uted the greatest total amount of contribu-
tions over the 5 preceding plan years, if such 
employer has contributed at least 10 percent 
of the total contributions to the plan over 
such 5 plan years without regard to collec-
tion of any withdrawal liability. 
‘‘(ff) If no employer has contributed at 
least 10 percent of the total contributions to 
the plan over the 5 preceding plan years, the 
withdrawal of the employer which contrib-
uted the greatest total amount of contribu-
tions for the current plan year, without re-
gard to collection of any withdrawal liabil-
ity, unless the employer contributed less 
than 1 percent of the total contributions to 
the plan for such plan year. 
‘‘(gg) Other assumptions consistent with 
the projection based on the actuary’s best es-
timate assumptions.’’.

‘‘(1) DETERMINATION OF WITHDRAWAL LIABIL-
ITY.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The withdrawal liability

amount determined under subparagraph (B), 
adjusted— 
‘‘(i) first, in the case of a partial with-
drawal, in accordance with section 4206; 
‘‘(ii) second, by any de minimis reduction 
applicable under section 4209; and 
‘‘(iii) third, in accordance with section 
4225.

vested benefits; or 
‘‘(ii) the present value of a series of 20 
equal annual payments in the amount deter-

of 3 consecutive plan years that includes the 
withdrawal of every employer from the plan, 
or the cessation of the obligation of all em-
ployers to contribute under the plan, as de-
scribed in section 4041A(a)(2). For purposes of 
this clause, withdrawal by an employer from 
a plan, during a period of 3 consecutive plan 
years within which substantially all the em-
ployers who have an obligation to contribute 
under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed 
to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement 
or arrangement, unless the employer proves 
otherwise by a preponderance of the evi-
dence. 
‘‘(D) PRESENT VALUE.—For purposes of sub-
paragraph (B)(ii), the present value of the 
annual payments shall be determined based 
on the assumptions used for the most recent

mined under clause (ii), calculated as if the 
first payment were made on the first day of

which the withdrawal occurs and as if each 
subsequent payment were made on the first 
day of each subsequent plan year. Actual

cordance with this subparagraph and in such 
manner as the corporation shall provide.

scribed in section 4205(a), the amount of each 
annual payment shall be the product of— 
‘‘(I) the amount determined under subpara-
graph (C) (determined without regard to this 
subparagraph), multiplied by 
‘‘(II) the fraction determined under section 
4206(a)(2). 
‘‘(iii) In the case of a de minimis reduction 
under section 4209, the period of years de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) shall be ad-
justed so that the withdrawal liability 
amount, as reduced under such section, is 
amortized in level annual payments deter-
mined under subparagraph (C).’’.

mined under subparagraph (B)(ii) with re-
spect to each of the preceding partial with-
drawals.

scribed in clause (i) shall be phased out con-

‘‘(i) the first day of a specified plan year 
following the date of the adoption of the 
amendment, except that the plan sponsor

fective date with respect to each collective 
bargaining agreement under which contribu-
tions to the multiemployer plan are re-
quired, which shall occur on the first day of 
the first plan year beginning after the termi-
nation, or if earlier, the re-opening, of each 
such agreement, or such earlier date as the 
parties to the agreement and the plan spon-
sor of the multiemployer plan shall agree to; 
and 
‘‘(ii) not later than the first day of the 
fifth plan year beginning on or after the date 
of the adoption of the amendment; 
‘‘(D) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, no further benefits shall ac-
crue under the defined benefit component of 
the multiemployer plan; and 
‘‘(E) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, the plan sponsor of the multi-
employer plan shall be the plan sponsor of 
both the composite plan component and the 
defined benefit plan component of the plan. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL
RULES.—If a multiemployer 
plan is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title and 
title IV shall be applied to the composite 
plan component and the defined benefit plan 
component of the multiemployer plan as if 
each such component were maintained as a 
separate plan; and 
‘‘(B) the assets of the composite plan com-
ponent and the defined benefit plan compo-
nent of the plan shall be held in a single 
trust forming part of the plan under which 
the trust instrument expressly provides— 
‘‘(i) for separate accounts (and appropriate 
records) to be maintained to reflect the in-
terest which each of the plan components 
has in the trust, including separate account-
ing for additions to the trust for the benefit 
of each plan component, disbursements made 
from each plan component’s account in the 
trust, investment experience of the trust al-
locable to that account, and administrative 
expenses (whether direct expenses or shared 
expenses allocated proportionally), and per-
mits, but does not require, the pooling of 
some or all of the assets of the two plan com-
ponents for investment purposes, subject to 
the judgment of the plan fiduciaries; and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, rein-
vested, managed, administered and distrib-
uted for the exclusive benefit of the partici-
pants and beneficiaries of each such plan 
component, and in no event shall the assets 
of one of the plan components be available to 
pay benefits due under the other plan compo-
nent. 
‘‘(4) NOT A TERMINATION EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A, an amendment pur-
suant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the fea-
tures of a composite plan as a component of 
a multiemployer plan does not constitute 
termination of the multiemployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Sec-
retary of the intent to establish the com-
posite plan (or, in the case of a composite 
plan incorporated as a component of a multi-
employer plan as described in paragraph (1), 
the intent to amend the multiemployer plan 
to incorporate such composite plan) at least 
30 days prior to the effective date of such es-
tablishment or amendment. 
‘‘(B) CERTIFICATION.—In the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in para-
graph (1), such notice shall include a certifi-
cation by the plan actuary under section

posite plan’ includes a composite plan com-
ponent added to a defined benefit plan pursu-
ant to paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing 
the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan 
from adopting an amendment pursuant to 
paragraph (1) because some collective bar-
gaining agreements are amended to cease 
any covered employer’s obligation to con-
tribute to the multiemployer plan before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. Para-
graph (2)(B) shall not be construed as pre-
venting the plan sponsor of a multiemployer 
plan from adopting an amendment pursuant 
to paragraph (1) because some participants 
cease to have contributions made to the mul-
tiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this part, 
sections 302, 304, and 305 shall not apply to a 
composite plan.

OF
A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
For purposes of this Act (other than sections 
302 and 4245), a composite plan shall be treat-
ed as if it were a defined benefit plan unless

TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.—

hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a 
composite plan, the plan actuary of the com-
posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the plan 
sponsor the plan’s current funded ratio and 
projected funded ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO
AND
PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—For 
purposes of this section: 
‘‘(A) CURRENT FUNDED RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a per-
centage) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year; to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s calculation of the 
present value of the plan liabilities as of the 
first day of the plan year. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the funded ratio deter-
mined under subparagraph (A), projected as 
of the first day of the fifteenth plan year fol-
lowing the plan year for which the deter-
mination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATE 
INCREASES.—For 
purposes 
of 
projections 
under this subsection, the plan actuary may 
anticipate contribution rate increases be-
yond the term of the current collective bar-
gaining agreement and any agreed-to supple-
ments, if reasonable, not to exceed 2.5 per-
cent per year, compounded annually. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS
AND METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part: 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, 
rates of interest, and other factors under the 
plan shall be determined for a plan year on 
the basis of actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking 
into account the experience of the plan and 
reasonable expectations); 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan; and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change 
from the actuarial assumptions and methods 
used in the previous plan year shall be cer-
tified by the plan actuary and the actuarial 
rationale for such change provided in the an-
nual report required by section 103. 
‘‘(2) FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into 
account on the basis of their fair market 
value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION OF NORMAL COST AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and 
liabilities shall be based— 
‘‘(A) on the most recent actuarial valu-
ation required under section 801(a)(5)(A) and 
the unit credit funding method; and 
‘‘(B) on rates of interest subject to section 
304(b)(6). 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day 
of such plan year, but not later than 21⁄2 
months after such day, shall be deemed to 
have been made on such last day. For pur-
poses of this paragraph, such 21⁄2-month pe-
riod may be extended to a total of not more 
than 120 days under regulations prescribed 
by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this 
part, the provisions of section 305(b)(4)(B) 
shall apply to any determination or projec-
tion under this part. 
‘‘SEC. 803. REALIGNMENT PROGRAM. 
‘‘(a) REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 802(a) 
that the plan’s projected funded ratio is 
below 120 percent for the plan year, the plan 
sponsor shall adopt a realignment program 
under paragraph (2) not later than 210 days 
after the due date of the certification re-
quired under such section 802(a). The plan 
sponsor shall adopt an updated realignment 
program for each succeeding plan year for 
which a certification described in the pre-
ceding sentence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written 
program which consists of reasonable meas-
ures, including options or a range of options 
to be undertaken by the plan sponsor or pro-
posed to the bargaining parties, formulated, 
based on reasonably anticipated experience 
and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to en-
able the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program 
described in subparagraph (A) may include 
any of the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future ben-
efit accruals, so long as the resulting rate is 
not less than 1 percent of the contributions 
on which benefits are based as of the start of 
the plan year (or the equivalent standard ac-
crual rate as described in section 305(f)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of ad-
justable benefits of participants that are not 
in pay status before the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other lawfully available meas-
ures not specifically described in this sub-
paragraph or subparagraph (C) or (D) that 
the plan sponsor determines are reasonable.

the following plan year, the realignment pro-
gram may also include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of fu-
ture benefit accruals without regard to the 
limitation applicable under subparagraph

clude one or more of the factors listed in 
subclauses 
(I) 
through 
(X) 
of 
section

year that begins following the adoption of 
the realignment program.

if the bargaining parties fail to agree to con-
tribution increases, such changes shall take

plan year beginning after the third anniver-
sary of the date of adoption of the realign-
ment program.

‘‘SEC. 805. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this part 
and parts 2 and 3, a defined benefit plan shall 
be treated as a legacy plan with respect to 
the composite plan under which employees 
who were eligible to accrue a benefit under 
the defined benefit plan become eligible to 
accrue a benefit under such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to 
add a composite plan component pursuant to 
section 801(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied 
by substituting ‘defined benefit component’ 
for ‘defined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan 
component’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is 
considered eligible to accrue a benefit under 
a composite plan as of the first day in which

under a collective bargaining agreement 
that provides for contributions to and accru-
als under the composite plan in lieu of accru-
als under the defined benefit plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.— 
As used in this part, the term ‘collective bar-
gaining agreement’ includes any agreement 
under which an employer has an obligation 
to contribute to a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER TERMS.—Any term used in this 
part which is not defined in this part and 
which is also used in section 305 shall have 
the same meaning provided such term in 
such section. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN OF AGREEMENTS AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a 
composite plan shall not accept or recognize 
a collective bargaining agreement (or any 
modification to such agreement), and no con-
tributions may be accepted and no benefits 
may be accrued or otherwise earned under 
the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary 
of any defined benefit plan that would be 
treated as a legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan has certified under section 
305(b)(4) that such defined benefit plan is or 
will be in endangered or critical status for 
the plan year in which such agreement would 
take effect or for any of the succeeding 5 
plan years; and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each 
employer who is a party to such agreement, 
including employers whose employees are 
not participants in the legacy plan, to pro-
vide contributions to the legacy plan with 
respect to such composite plan in a manner 
that satisfies the transition contribution re-
quirements of subsection (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan that an agreement fails to satisfy 
the requirements described in paragraph (1), 
the plan sponsor shall provide notification of 
such failure and the reasons for such deter-
mination— 
‘‘(A) to the parties to the agreement; 
‘‘(B) to active participants of the com-
posite plan who have ceased to accrue or oth-
erwise earn benefits with respect to service 
with an employer pursuant to paragraph (1); 
and 
‘‘(C) to the Secretary, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining 
agreement entered into after the date of en-
actment of this part, ceases to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a multiemployer de-
fined benefit plan, no employees employed 
by the employer may accrue or otherwise 
earn benefits under any composite plan, with 
respect to service with that employer, for a 
60-month period beginning on the date on 
which the employer entered into such collec-
tive bargaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to 
contribute to a legacy plan with respect to 
employees employed by an employer that is 
or will be contributing to a composite plan 
with respect to service of such employees, 
the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall no-
tify the plan sponsor of the composite plan 
of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.— 
Not later than 30 days after determining 
that an employer has ceased to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a legacy plan, the 
plan sponsor of the composite plan shall no-
tify the bargaining parties, the active par-
ticipants affected by the cessation of accru-
als, the Secretary, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation of the cessation of accruals, the 
period during which such cessation is in ef-
fect, and the reasons therefor. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribu-
tion requirements of this subsection if the 
agreement— 
‘‘(A) authorizes payment of contributions 
to a legacy plan at a rate, or multiple rates, 
as described in paragraph (2)(B), equal to or 
greater than the transition contribution rate 
established by the legacy plan under para-
graph (2); and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the 
legacy plan with respect to any period of 
service; or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in de-
termining contributions owed to the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The transition contribu-
tion rate for a plan year is the contribution 
rate that, as certified by the actuary of the 
legacy plan in accordance with the principles 
in section 305(b)(4)(B), is reasonably expected 
to be adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan 
year; 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 
years, beginning with the plan year in which 
the transition contribution rate is first es-
tablished; and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes 
in the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to 
experience gains or losses (including invest-
ment gains or losses, gains or losses due to 
contributions greater or less than the con-
tributions made under the prior transition 
contribution rate, and other actuarial gains 
or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions, 
changes to the legacy plan’s benefits, or 
changes in funding method over a period of 
15 plan years beginning with the plan year 
following the plan year in which such change 
in unfunded liability is incurred, unless oth-
erwise prescribed. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which 
such rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan 
by different employers or for different class-
es of employees, the certification by the ac-
tuary of the legacy plan shall specify a tran-
sition contribution rate for each such em-
ployer or class of employees. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate 
applicable to an employer for a plan year is 
the rate in effect for the plan year of the leg-
acy plan that commences on or after 180 days 
before the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the 
employer contributes to the legacy plan; or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for 
which the transition contribution rate appli-
cable to the employer was established or up-
dated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribu-
tion rate applicable to an employer for the 
first plan year beginning on or after the 
commencement of the employer’s obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days be-
fore such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the leg-
acy plan has certified under section 305 that 
the plan is in endangered or critical status 
for a plan year, the transition contribution 
rate for the following plan year is the rate 
determined with respect to the employer 
under the legacy plan’s funding improvement 
or rehabilitation plan under section 305, if 
greater than the rate otherwise determined, 
but in no event shall the transition contribu-
tion rate be greater than 75 percent of the 
sum of the contribution rates applicable to 
the legacy plan and the composite plan for 
the plan year. Notwithstanding the pre-
ceding sentence, if the transition contribu-
tion rate in the prior year is more than 75 
percent of the sum of the contribution rates 
applicable to the legacy plan and the com-
posite plan for the prior plan year, the tran-
sition contribution rate applicable to the 
legacy plan shall not be subject to the 75-per-
cent limitation, but shall be neither in-
creased nor reduced as a percentage of the 
sum of the contribution rates applicable to 
the legacy plan and the composite plan for 
the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subpara-
graph (A), the determination of the transi-
tion contribution rate for a plan year shall 
be based on actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods consistent with the minimum funding 
determinations made under section 304 (or, if 
applicable, section 305) with respect to the 
legacy plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS
IN
RATE.—The plan 
sponsor of a legacy plan from time to time 
may adjust the transition contribution rate 
or rates applicable to an employer under this 
paragraph by increasing some rates and de-
creasing others if the actuary certifies that 
such adjusted rates in combination will 
produce projected contribution income for 
the plan year beginning on or after the date 
of certification that is not less than would be 
produced by the transition contribution

cation. 
‘‘(G) NOTICE
OF
TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION 
RATE.—The plan sponsor of a legacy plan 
shall provide notice to the parties to collec-
tive bargaining agreements pursuant to 
which contributions are made to the legacy 
plan of changes to the transition contribu-
tion rate requirements at least 30 days be-
fore the beginning of the plan year for which 
the rate is effective. 
‘‘(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.— 
Not later than 30 days after a determination 
by the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a 
collective bargaining agreement provides for 
a rate of contributions that is below the 
transition contribution rate applicable to 
one or more employers that are parties to 
the collective bargaining agreement, the 
plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify 
the plan sponsor of any composite plan under 
which employees of such employer would 
otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. 
‘‘(3) CORRECTION PROCEDURES.—Pursuant to 
standards prescribed by the Secretary, the 
plan sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt 
rules and procedures that give the parties to 
the collective bargaining agreement notice 
of the failure of such agreement to satisfy 
the transition contribution requirements of 
this subsection, and a reasonable oppor-
tunity to correct such failure, not to exceed 
180 days from the date of notice given under 
subsection (b)(2). 
‘‘(4) SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS.—A col-
lective bargaining agreement may provide 
for supplemental contributions to the legacy 
plan for a plan year in excess of the transi-
tion contribution rate determined under 
paragraph (2), regardless of whether the leg-
acy plan is in endangered or critical status 
for such plan year. 
‘‘(e) NONAPPLICATION
OF COMPOSITE PLAN 
RESTRICTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The provisions of sub-
sections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with 
respect to a collective bargaining agreement, 
to the extent the agreement, or a prede-
cessor agreement, provides or provided for 
contributions to a defined benefit plan that 
is a legacy plan, as of the first day of the 
first plan year following a plan year for 
which the plan actuary certifies that the 
plan is fully funded, has been fully funded for 
at least three out of the immediately pre-
ceding 5 plan years, and is projected to re-
main fully funded for at least the following 
4 plan years. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION OF FULLY FUNDED.—A 
plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph 
(1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for 
a plan year, the value of the plan’s assets 
equals or exceeds the present value of the 
plan’s liabilities, determined in accordance 
with the rules prescribed by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation under sections 
4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281 for multiemployer 
plans terminating by mass withdrawal, as in 
effect for the date of the determination, ex-
cept the plan’s reasonable assumption re-
garding the starting date of benefits may be 
used. 
‘‘(3) OTHER APPLICABLE RULES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (2), actuarial deter-
minations and projections under this section 
shall be based on the rules in section 802(b). 
‘‘SEC. 806. MERGERS AND ASSET TRANSFERS OF 
COMPOSITE PLANS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Assets and liabilities of 
a composite plan may only be merged with, 
or transferred to, another plan if— 
‘‘(1) the other plan is a composite plan; 
‘‘(2) the plan or plans resulting from the 
merger or transfer is a composite plan; 
‘‘(3) no participant’s accrued benefit or ad-
justable benefit is lower immediately after 
the transaction than it was immediately be-
fore the transaction; and 
‘‘(4) the value of the assets transferred in 
the case of a transfer reasonably reflects the 
value of the amounts contributed with re-
spect to the participants whose benefits are 
being transferred, adjusted for allocable dis-
tributions, investment gains and losses, and 
administrative expenses. 
A plan which is not a composite plan may 
not merge with or transfer assets and liabil-
ities to a composite plan. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or trans-
fer involving a composite plan, the legacy 
plan with respect to an employer that is ob-
ligated to contribute to the resulting com-
posite plan is the legacy plan that applied to 
that employer immediately before the merg-
er or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE
LEGACY
PLANS.—If an em-
ployer is obligated to contribute to more 
than one legacy plan with respect to employ-
ees eligible to accrue benefits under more 
than one composite plan and there is a merg-
er or transfer of such legacy plans, the tran-
sition contribution rate applicable to the 
legacy plan resulting from the merger or 
transfer with respect to that employer shall 
be determined in accordance with the provi-
sions of section 805(d)(2)(B).’’. 
(2) PENALTIES.— 
(A) CIVIL ENFORCEMENT OF FAILURE TO COM-
PLY
WITH
REALIGNMENT
PROGRAM.—Section

quired to adopt a realignment program under 
section 803, if the plan sponsor— 
‘‘(A) has not adopted a realignment pro-
gram under that section by the deadline es-
tablished in such section; or 
‘‘(B) fails to update or comply with the 
terms of the realignment program in accord-
ance with the requirements of such section, 
by the Secretary, by an employer that has an 
obligation to contribute with respect to the 
composite plan, or by an employee organiza-
tion that represents active participants in 
the composite plan, for an order compelling 
the plan sponsor to adopt a realignment pro-
gram, or to update or comply with the terms 
of the realignment program, in accordance 
with the requirements of such section and 
the realignment program.’’. 
(B) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Section 502(c) of such 
Act (29 U.S.C. 1132(c)), as amended by this 
Act, is further amended— 
(i) by moving paragraphs (8), (10), and (12) 
each 2 ems to the left;

802(a) on the plan actuary to certify the 
plan’s current or projected funded ratio by

to adopt a realignment program by the dead-
line established in that section and to com-
ply with its terms. 
‘‘(10)(A) The Secretary may assess against 
any plan sponsor of a composite plan a civil 
penalty of not more than $100 per day for 
each violation by such sponsor of the re-
quirement under section 803(b) to provide no-
tice as described in such section, except that 
no penalty may be assessed in any case in 
which the plan sponsor exercised reasonable 
diligence to meet the requirements of such 
section and— 
‘‘(i) the plan sponsor did not know that the 
violation existed; or 
‘‘(ii) the plan sponsor provided such notice 
during the 30-day period beginning on the 
first date on which the plan sponsor knew, or 
in exercising reasonable due diligence should 
have known, that such violation existed. 
‘‘(B) In any case in which the plan sponsor 
exercised reasonable diligence to meet the 
requirements of section 803(b), the Secretary 
may waive part or all of such penalty to the 
extent that the payment of such penalty 
would be excessive or otherwise inequitable 
relative to the violation involved. 
‘‘(11) The Secretary may assess against any 
plan sponsor of a composite plan a civil pen-
alty of not more than $100 per day for each 
violation by such sponsor of the notice re-
quirements

cost for the plan year;

‘‘(b) TRANSITION FROM
A MULTIEMPLOYER 
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a de-
fined benefit plan that is a multiemployer 
plan may, subject to paragraph (2), amend 
the plan to incorporate the features of a 
composite plan as a component of the multi-
employer plan separate from the defined ben-
efit plan component, except in the case of a 
defined benefit plan for which the plan actu-
ary has certified under section 432(b)(4) that 
the plan is or will be in endangered or crit-
ical status for the plan year in which such 
amendment would become effective or in en-
dangered or critical status for any of the 
succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS.—Any amendment pur-
suant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the fea-
tures of a composite plan as a component of 
a multiemployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) apply with respect to all collective 
bargaining agreements providing for con-
tributions to the multiemployer plan on or 
after the effective date of the amendment, 
‘‘(B) apply with respect to all participants 
in the multiemployer plan for whom con-
tributions are made to the multiemployer 
plan on or after the effective date of the 
amendment, 
‘‘(C) specify that the effective date of the 
amendment is— 
‘‘(i) the first day of a specified plan year 
following the date of the adoption of the 
amendment, except that the plan sponsor 
may alternatively provide for a separate ef-
fective date with respect to each collective 
bargaining agreement under which contribu-
tions to the multiemployer plan are re-
quired, which shall occur on the first day of 
the first plan year beginning after the termi-
nation, or if earlier, the re-opening, of each 
such agreement, or such earlier date as the 
parties to the agreement and the plan spon-
sor of the multiemployer plan shall agree to, 
and 
‘‘(ii) not later than the first day of the 
fifth plan year beginning on or after the date 
of the adoption of the amendment, 
‘‘(D) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, no further benefits shall ac-
crue under the defined benefit component of 
the multiemployer plan, and 
‘‘(E) specify that, as of the amendment’s 
effective date, the plan sponsor of the multi-
employer plan shall be the plan sponsor of 
both the composite plan component and the 
defined benefit plan component of the plan. 
‘‘(3) SPECIAL
RULES.—If a multiemployer 
plan is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)— 
‘‘(A) the requirements of this title shall be 
applied to the composite plan component 
and the defined benefit plan component of 
the multiemployer plan as if each such com-
ponent were maintained as a separate plan, 
and 
‘‘(B) the assets of the composite plan com-
ponent and the defined benefit plan compo-
nent of the plan shall be held in a single 
trust forming part of the plan under which 
the trust instrument expressly provides— 
‘‘(i) for separate accounts (and appropriate 
records) to be maintained to reflect the in-
terest which each of the plan components 
has in the trust, including separate account-
ing for additions to the trust for the benefit 
of each plan component, disbursements made 
from each plan component’s account in the 
trust, investment experience of the trust al-
locable to that account, and administrative 
expenses (whether direct expenses or shared 
expenses allocated proportionally), and per-
mits, but does not require, the pooling of 
some or all of the assets of the two plan com-
ponents for investment purposes, subject to 
the judgment of the plan fiduciaries, and 
‘‘(ii) that the assets of each of the two plan 
components shall be held, invested, rein-
vested, managed, administered and distrib-
uted for the exclusive benefit of the partici-
pants and beneficiaries of each such plan 
component, and in no event shall the assets 
of one of the plan components be available to 
pay benefits due under the other plan compo-
nent. 
‘‘(4) NOT A TERMINATION EVENT.—Notwith-
standing section 4041A of the Employee Re-
tirement Income Security Act of 1974, an 
amendment pursuant to paragraph (1) to in-
corporate the features of a composite plan as 
a component of a multiemployer plan does 
not constitute termination of the multiem-
ployer plan. 
‘‘(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE.—The plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan shall provide notice to the Sec-
retary of Labor of the intent to establish the 
composite plan (or, in the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in para-
graph (1), the intent to amend the multiem-
ployer plan to incorporate such composite 
plan) at least 30 days prior to the effective 
date of such establishment or amendment. 
‘‘(B) CERTIFICATION.—In the case of a com-
posite plan incorporated as a component of a 
multiemployer plan as described in para-
graph (1), such notice shall include a certifi-
cation by the plan actuary under section 
432(b)(4) that the effective date of the amend-
ment occurs in a plan year for which the 
multiemployer plan is not in endangered or 
critical status for that plan year and any of 
the succeeding 5 plan years. 
‘‘(6) REFERENCES TO COMPOSITE PLAN COMPO-
NENT.—As used in this part, the term ‘com-
posite plan’ includes a composite plan com-
ponent added to a defined benefit plan pursu-
ant to paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Paragraph 
(2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing 
the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan 
from adopting an amendment pursuant to 
paragraph (1) because some collective bar-
gaining agreements are amended to cease 
any covered employer’s obligation to con-
tribute to the multiemployer plan before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. Para-
graph (2)(B) shall not be construed as pre-
venting the plan sponsor of a multiemployer 
plan from adopting an amendment pursuant 
to paragraph (1) because some participants 
cease to have contributions made to the mul-
tiemployer plan on their behalf before or 
after the plan amendment is effective. 
‘‘(c) COORDINATION WITH FUNDING RULES.— 
Except as otherwise provided in this part, 
sections 412, 431, and 432 shall not apply to a 
composite plan. 
‘‘(d) TREATMENT
OF
A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
For purposes of this title (other than sec-
tions 412 and 418E), a composite plan shall be 
treated as if it were a defined benefit plan 
unless a different treatment is provided for 
under applicable law. 
‘‘SEC. 438. FUNDED RATIOS; ACTUARIAL ASSUMP-
TIONS. 
‘‘(a) CERTIFICATION OF FUNDED RATIOS.—

hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a 
composite plan, the plan actuary of the com-
posite plan shall certify to the Secretary, 
the Secretary of Labor, and the plan sponsor 
the plan’s current funded ratio and projected 
funded ratio for the plan year. 
‘‘(2) DETERMINATION
OF
CURRENT
FUNDED 
RATIO
AND
PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—For 
purposes of this section— 
‘‘(A) CURRENT FUNDED RATIO.—The current 
funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a per-
centage) of— 
‘‘(i) the value of the plan’s assets as of the 
first day of the plan year, to 
‘‘(ii) the plan actuary’s calculation of the 
present value of the plan liabilities as of the 
first day of the plan year. 
‘‘(B) PROJECTED
FUNDED
RATIO.—The pro-
jected funded ratio is the funded ratio deter-
mined under subparagraph (A), projected as 
of the first day of the fifteenth plan year fol-
lowing the plan year for which the deter-
mination is being made. 
‘‘(3) CONSIDERATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATE 
INCREASES.—For 
purposes 
of 
projections 
under this subsection, the plan actuary may 
anticipate contribution rate increases be-
yond the term of the current collective bar-
gaining agreement and any agreed-to supple-
ments, if reasonable, not to exceed 2.5 per-
cent per year, compounded annually. 
‘‘(b) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS
AND METH-
ODS.—For purposes of this part— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—All costs, liabilities, 
rates of interest, and other factors under the 
plan shall be determined for a plan year on 
the basis of actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods— 
‘‘(A) each of which is reasonable (taking 
into account the experience of the plan and 
reasonable expectations), 
‘‘(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-
ary’s best estimate of anticipated experience 
under the plan, and 
‘‘(C) with respect to which any change 
from the actuarial assumptions and methods 
used in the previous plan year shall be cer-
tified by the plan actuary and the actuarial 
rationale for such change provided in the an-
nual report required by section 6058. 
‘‘(2) FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS.—The 
value of the plan’s assets shall be taken into 
account on the basis of their fair market 
value. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION OF NORMAL COST AND 
PLAN LIABILITIES.—A plan’s normal cost and 
liabilities shall be based on— 
‘‘(A) the most recent actuarial valuation 
required under section 437(a)(5)(A) and the 
unit credit funding method; and 
‘‘(B) rates of interest subject to section 
431(b)(6). 
‘‘(4) TIME
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONTRIBUTIONS 
DEEMED MADE.—Any contributions for a plan 
year made by an employer after the last day 
of such plan year, but not later than 21⁄2 
months after such day, shall be deemed to 
have been made on such last day. For pur-
poses of this paragraph, such 21⁄2-month pe-
riod may be extended to a total of not more 
than 120 days under regulations prescribed 
by the Secretary. 
‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
Except where otherwise provided in this 
part, the provisions of section 432(b)(4)(B)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7627 
December 17, 2020 
‘‘(1) ADOPTION.—In any case in which the 
plan actuary certifies under section 438(a) 
that the plan’s projected funded ratio is 
below 120 percent for the plan year, the plan 
sponsor shall adopt a realignment program 
under paragraph (2) not later than 210 days 
after the due date of the certification re-
quired under section 438(a). The plan sponsor 
shall adopt an updated realignment program 
for each succeeding plan year for which a 
certification described in the preceding sen-
tence is made. 
‘‘(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
adopted under this paragraph is a written 
program which consists of reasonable meas-
ures, including options or a range of options 
to be undertaken by the plan sponsor or pro-
posed to the bargaining parties, formulated, 
based on reasonably anticipated experience 
and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to en-
able the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year. 
‘‘(B) INITIAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—Reason-
able measures under a realignment program 
described in subparagraph (A) may include 
any of the following: 
‘‘(i) Proposed contribution increases. 
‘‘(ii) A reduction in the rate of future ben-
efit accruals, so long as the resulting rate 
shall not be less than 1 percent of the con-
tributions on which benefits are based as of 
the start of the plan year (or the equivalent 
standard accrual rate as described in section 
432(f)(6)). 
‘‘(iii) A modification or elimination of ad-
justable benefits of participants that are not 
in pay status before the date of the notice re-
quired under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(iv) Any other legally available measures 
not specifically described in this subpara-
graph or subparagraph (C) or (D) that the 
plan sponsor determines are reasonable. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—If 
the plan sponsor has determined that all rea-
sonable measures available under subpara-
graph (B) will not enable the plan to achieve 
a projected funded ratio of at least 120 per-
cent the following plan year, such realign-
ment program may also include— 
‘‘(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that 
are not in pay status by the date of the no-
tice required under subsection (b)(1), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of any benefits of partici-
pants that are in pay status before the date 
of the notice required under subsection (b)(1) 
other than core benefits as defined in para-
graph (4). 
‘‘(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.—In the case 
of a composite plan for which the plan spon-
sor has determined that all reasonable meas-
ures available under subparagraphs (B) and 
(C) will not enable the plan to achieve a pro-
jected funded ratio of at least 120 percent for 
the following plan year, the realignment pro-
gram may also include— 
‘‘(i) a further reduction in the rate of fu-
ture benefit accruals without regard to the 
limitation applicable under subparagraph 
(B)(ii), or 
‘‘(ii) a reduction of core benefits, 
provided that such reductions shall be equi-
tably distributed across the participant and 
beneficiary population, taking into account 
factors, with respect to participants and 
beneficiaries and their benefits, that may in-
clude one or more of the factors listed in 
subclauses 
(I) 
through 
(X) 
of 
section 
432(f)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent necessary to en-
able the plan to achieve a projected funded 
ratio of at least 120 percent for the following 
plan year. 
‘‘(3) ADJUSTABLE
BENEFIT
DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this part, the term ‘adjustable 
benefit’ means— 
‘‘(A) benefits, rights, and features under 
the plan, including post-retirement death 
benefits, disability benefits not yet in pay 
status, and similar benefits, 
‘‘(B) any early retirement benefit or retire-
ment-type subsidy (within the meaning of 
section 411(d)(6)(B)(i)) (including early reduc-
tion factors which are not provided on an ac-
tuarially equivalent basis) and any benefit 
payment option (other than the qualified 
joint and survivor annuity), 
‘‘(C) benefit increases which were adopted 
(or, if later, took effect) less than 120 months 
before the first day of the first plan year in 
which such realignment program took effect, 
‘‘(D) any one-time bonus payment or ‘thir-
teenth check’ provision, and 
‘‘(E) benefits granted for period of service 
prior to participation in the plan. 
‘‘(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.—For purposes 
of this part, the term ‘core benefit’ means a 
participant’s accrued benefit payable in the 
normal form of an annuity commencing at 
normal retirement age, determined without 
regard to— 
‘‘(A) any early retirement benefits, retire-
ment-type 
subsidies, 
or 
other 
benefits, 
rights, or features that may be associated 
with that benefit, and 
‘‘(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or ben-
efit increases effective after the date of re-
tirement. 
‘‘(5) COORDINATION
WITH
CONTRIBUTION
IN-
CREASES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—A realignment program 
may provide that some or all of the benefit 
modifications described in the program will 
only take effect if the bargaining parties fail 
to agree to specified levels of increases in 
contributions to the plan, effective as of 
specified dates. 
‘‘(B) 
INDEPENDENT
BENEFIT
MODIFICA-
TIONS.—If a realignment program adopts any 
changes to the benefit formula that are inde-
pendent of potential contribution increases, 
such changes shall take effect not later than 
180 days following the first day of the first 
plan year that begins following the adoption 
of the realignment program. 
‘‘(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
If a realignment program adopts any changes 
to the benefit formula that take effect only 
if the bargaining parties fail to agree to con-
tribution increases, such changes shall take 
effect not later than the first day of the first 
plan year beginning after the third anniver-
sary of the date of adoption of the realign-
ment program. 
‘‘(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Benefit modifications described 
in paragraph (3) may be revoked, in whole or 
in part, and retroactively or prospectively, 
when contributions to the plan are in-
creased, as specified in the realignment pro-
gram, including any amendments thereto. 
The preceding sentence shall not apply un-
less the contribution increases are to be ef-
fective not later than the fifth anniversary 
of the first day of the first plan year that be-
gins after the adoption of the realignment 
program. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which it is 
certified under section 438(a) that the pro-
jected funded ratio is less than 120 percent, 
the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days 
after the date of the certification, provide 
notification of the current and projected 
funded ratios to the participants and bene-
ficiaries, the bargaining parties, the Sec-
retary of Labor, and the Secretary. Such no-
tice shall include— 
‘‘(A) an explanation that contribution rate 
increases or benefit reductions may be nec-
essary, 
‘‘(B) a description of the types of benefits 
that might be reduced, and 
‘‘(C) an estimate of the contribution in-
creases and benefit reductions that may be 
necessary to achieve a projected funded ratio 
of 120 percent. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—No modifications may 
be made that reduce the rate of future ben-
efit accrual or that reduce core benefits or 
adjustable benefits unless notice of such re-
duction has been given at least 180 days be-
fore the general effective date of such reduc-
tion for all participants and beneficiaries 
to— 
‘‘(i) plan participants and beneficiaries, 
‘‘(ii) each employer who has an obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan, and 
‘‘(iii) each employee organization which, 
for purposes of collective bargaining, rep-
resents plan participants employed by such 
employers. 
‘‘(B) CONTENT OF NOTICE.—The notice under 
subparagraph (A) shall contain— 
‘‘(i) sufficient information to enable par-
ticipants and beneficiaries to understand the 
effect of any reduction on their benefits, in-
cluding an illustration of any affected ben-
efit or subsidy, on an annual or monthly 
basis that a participant or beneficiary would 
otherwise have been eligible for as of the 
general effective date described in subpara-
graph (A), and 
‘‘(ii) information as to the rights and rem-
edies of plan participants and beneficiaries 
as well as how to contact the Department of 
the Treasury for further information and as-
sistance, where appropriate.

(1) that any notice under this subsection 
must include. 
‘‘(4) DELIVERY METHOD.—Any notice under 
this part shall be provided in writing and

‘‘SEC. 440. LIMITATION ON INCREASING BENE-
FITS. 
‘‘(a) LEVEL OF CURRENT FUNDED RATIOS.— 
Except as provided in subsections (c), (d), 
and (e), no plan amendment increasing bene-
fits or establishing new benefits under a 
composite plan may be adopted for a plan 
year unless— 
‘‘(1) the plan’s current funded ratio is at 
least 110 percent (without regard to the ben-
efit increase or new benefits), 
‘‘(2) taking the benefit increase or new ben-
efits into account, the current funded ratio 
is at least 100 percent and the projected fund-
ed ratio for the current plan year is at least 
120 percent, 
‘‘(3) in any case in which, after taking the 
benefit increase or new benefits into ac-
count, the current funded ratio is less than 
140 percent or the projected funded ratio is 
less than 140 percent, the benefit increase or 
new benefits are projected by the plan actu-
ary to increase the present value of the 
plan’s liabilities for the plan year by not 
more than 3 percent, and 
‘‘(4) expected contributions for the current 
plan year are at least 120 percent of normal 
cost for the plan year, determined using the

amended to reduce core benefits pursuant to 
a 
realignment 
program 
under 
section 
439(a)(2)(D), such plan may not be subse-
quently amended to increase core benefits 
unless the amendment— 
‘‘(1) increases the level of future benefit 
payments only, and 
‘‘(2) provides for an equitable distribution 
of benefit increases across the participant 
and beneficiary population, taking into ac-
count the extent to which the benefits of 
participants were previously reduced pursu-
ant to such realignment program. 
‘‘(c) EXCEPTION TO COMPLY WITH APPLICA-
BLE LAW.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment if the 
amendment is required as a condition of 
qualification under part I of subchapter D of 
chapter 1 or to comply with other applicable 
law. 
‘‘(d) EXCEPTION WHERE MAXIMUM DEDUCT-
IBLE LIMIT APPLIES.—Subsection (a) shall not 
apply in connection with a plan amendment 
if and to the extent that contributions to the 
composite plan would not be deductible for 
the plan year under section 404(a)(1)(E) if the 
plan amendment is not adopted. The Sec-
retary of the Treasury shall issue regula-
tions to implement this paragraph. 
‘‘(e) EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN BENEFIT MODI-
FICATIONS.—Subsection (a) shall not apply in 
connection with a plan amendment under 
section 439(a)(5)(C), regarding conditional 
benefit modifications. 
‘‘(f) TREATMENT
OF PLAN AMENDMENTS.— 
For purposes of this section— 
‘‘(1) if two or more plan amendments in-
creasing benefits or establishing new bene-
fits are adopted in a plan year, such amend-
ments shall be treated as a single amend-
ment adopted on the last day of the plan 
year, 
‘‘(2) all benefit increases and new benefits 
adopted in a single amendment are treated 
as a single benefit increase, irrespective of 
whether the increases and new benefits take 
effect in more than one plan year, and 
‘‘(3) increases in contributions or decreases 
in plan liabilities which are scheduled to 
take effect in future plan years may be 
taken into account in connection with a plan 
amendment if they have been agreed to in 
writing or otherwise formalized by the date 
the plan amendment is adopted. 
‘‘SEC. 440A. COMPOSITE PLAN RESTRICTIONS TO 
PRESERVE LEGACY PLAN FUNDING. 
‘‘(a) TREATMENT AS A LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sub-
chapter, a defined benefit plan shall be treat-
ed as a legacy plan with respect to the com-
posite plan under which employees who were 
eligible to accrue a benefit under the defined 
benefit plan become eligible to accrue a ben-
efit under such composite plan. 
‘‘(2) COMPONENT
PLANS.—In any case in 
which a defined benefit plan is amended to 
add a composite plan component pursuant to 
section 437(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied 
by substituting ‘defined benefit component’ 
for ‘defined benefit plan’ and ‘composite plan 
component’ for ‘composite plan’. 
‘‘(3) ELIGIBLE
TO
ACCRUE
A
BENEFIT.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is 
considered eligible to accrue a benefit under 
a composite plan as of the first day in which 
the employee completes an hour of service 
under a collective bargaining agreement 
that provides for contributions to and accru-
als under the composite plan in lieu of accru-
als under the defined benefit plan. 
‘‘(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.— 
As used in this part, the term ‘collective bar-
gaining agreement’ includes any agreement 
under which an employer has an obligation 
to contribute to a plan. 
‘‘(5) OTHER TERMS.—Any term used in this 
part which is not defined in this part and 
which is also used in section 432 shall have 
the same meaning provided such term in 
such section. 
‘‘(b) RESTRICTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE BY COM-
POSITE PLAN OF AGREEMENTS AND CONTRIBU-
TIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—The plan sponsor of a 
composite plan shall not accept or recognize 
a collective bargaining agreement (or any 
modification to such agreement), and no con-
tributions may be accepted and no benefits 
may be accrued or otherwise earned under 
the agreement— 
‘‘(A) in any case in which the plan actuary 
of any defined benefit plan that would be 
treated as a legacy plan with respect to such 
composite plan has certified under section 
432(b)(4) that such defined benefit plan is or 
will be in endangered or critical status for 
the plan year in which such agreement would 
take effect or for any of the succeeding 5 
plan years, and 
‘‘(B) unless the agreement requires each 
employer who is a party to such agreement, 
including employers whose employees are 
not participants in the legacy plan, to pro-
vide contributions to the legacy plan with 
respect to such composite plan in a manner 
that satisfies the transition contribution re-
quirements of subsection (d). 
‘‘(2) NOTICE.—Not later than 30 days after a 
determination by a plan sponsor of a com-
posite plan that an agreement fails to satisfy 
the requirements described in paragraph (1), 
the plan sponsor shall provide notification of 
such failure and the reasons for such deter-
mination to— 
‘‘(A) the parties to the agreement, 
‘‘(B) active participants of the composite 
plan who have ceased to accrue or otherwise 
earn benefits with respect to service with an 
employer pursuant to paragraph (1), and 
‘‘(C) the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(c) RESTRICTION ON ACCRUAL OF BENEFITS 
UNDER A COMPOSITE PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which an 
employer, under a collective bargaining 
agreement entered into after the date of en-
actment of the Chris Allen Multiemployer 
Pension Recapitalization and Reform Act of 
2020, ceases to have an obligation to con-
tribute to a multiemployer defined benefit 
plan, no employees employed by the em-
ployer may accrue or otherwise earn benefits 
under any composite plan, with respect to 
service with that employer, for a 60-month 
period beginning on the date on which the 
employer entered into such collective bar-
gaining agreement. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.— 
Within 30 days of determining that an em-
ployer has ceased to have an obligation to 
contribute to a legacy plan with respect to 
employees employed by an employer that is 
or will be contributing to a composite plan 
with respect to service of such employees, 
the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall no-
tify the plan sponsor of the composite plan 
of that cessation. 
‘‘(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.— 
Not later than 30 days after determining 
that an employer has ceased to have an obli-
gation to contribute to a legacy plan, the 
plan sponsor of the composite plan shall no-
tify the bargaining parties, the active par-
ticipants affected by the cessation of accru-
als, the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, 
and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpora-
tion of the cessation of accruals, the period 
during which such cessation is in effect, and 
the reasons therefor. 
‘‘(4) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.— 
This subsection shall not apply to benefits 
accrued before the date on which notice is 
provided under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(d) TRANSITION
CONTRIBUTION
REQUIRE-
MENTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A collective bargaining 
agreement satisfies the transition contribu-
tion requirements of this subsection if the 
agreement— 
‘‘(A) authorizes for payment of contribu-
tions to a legacy plan at a rate, or multiple 
rates, as described in paragraph (2)(B), equal 
to or greater than the transition contribu-
tion rate established under paragraph (2), 
and 
‘‘(B) does not provide for— 
‘‘(i) a suspension of contributions to the 
legacy plan with respect to any period of 
service, or 
‘‘(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of 
younger or newly hired employees of the em-
ployer from being taken into account in de-
termining contributions owed to the legacy 
plan. 
‘‘(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The transition contribu-
tion rate for a plan year is the contribution 
rate that, as certified by the actuary of the 
legacy plan in accordance with the principles 
in section 432(b)(4)(B), is reasonably expected 
to be adequate— 
‘‘(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan 
year, 
‘‘(ii) to amortize the plan’s unfunded liabil-
ities in level annual installments over 25 
years, beginning with the plan year in which 
the transition contribution rate is first es-
tablished, and 
‘‘(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes 
in the legacy plan’s unfunded liability due to 
experience gains or losses (including invest-
ment gains or losses, gains or losses due to 
contributions greater or less than the con-
tributions made under the prior transition 
contribution rate, and other actuarial gains 
or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions, 
changes to the legacy plan’s benefits, or 
changes in funding method over a period of 
15 plan years beginning with the plan year 
following the plan year in which such change 
in unfunded liability is incurred, unless oth-
erwise prescribed. 
The transition contribution rate for any plan 
year may not be less than the transition con-
tribution rate for the plan year in which 
such rate is first established. 
‘‘(B) MULTIPLE RATES.—If different rates of 
contribution are payable to the legacy plan 
by different employers or for different class-
es of employees, the certification by the ac-
tuary of the legacy plan shall specify a tran-
sition contribution rate for each such em-
ployer or class of employees. 
‘‘(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided by 
clause (ii), the transition contribution rate 
applicable to an employer for a plan year is 
the rate in effect for the plan year of the leg-
acy plan that commences on or after 180 days 
before the earlier of— 
‘‘(I) the effective date of the collective bar-
gaining agreement pursuant to which the 
employer contributes to the legacy plan, or 
‘‘(II) 5 years after the last plan year for 
which the transition contribution rate appli-
cable to the employer was established or up-
dated. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—The transition contribu-
tion rate applicable to an employer for the 
first plan year beginning on or after the 
commencement of the employer’s obligation 
to contribute to the composite plan is the 
rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy 
plan that commences on or after 180 days be-
fore such first plan year. 
‘‘(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—If the plan actuary of the leg-
acy plan has certified under section 432 that 
the plan is in endangered or critical status

for a plan year, the transition contribution 
rate for the following plan year is the rate 
determined with respect to the employer 
under the legacy plan’s funding improvement 
or rehabilitation plan under section 432, if 
greater than the rate otherwise determined, 
but in no event shall the transition contribu-
tion rate be greater than 75 percent of the 
sum of the contribution rates applicable to 
the legacy plan and the composite plan for 
the plan year. Notwithstanding the pre-
ceding sentence, if the transition contribu-
tion rate in the prior year is more than 75 
percent of the sum of the contribution rates 
applicable to the legacy plan and the com-
posite plan for the prior plan year, the tran-
sition contribution rate applicable to the 
legacy plan shall not be subject to the 75-per-
cent limitation, but shall be neither in-
creased nor reduced as a percentage of the 
sum of the contribution rates applicable to 
the legacy plan and the composite plan for 
the plan year. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
ACTUARIAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND 
METHODS.—Except as provided in subpara-
graph (A), the determination of the transi-
tion contribution rate for a plan year shall 
be based on actuarial assumptions and meth-
ods consistent with the minimum funding 
determinations made under section 431 (or, if 
applicable, section 432) with respect to the 
legacy plan for the plan year. 
‘‘(F) ADJUSTMENTS
IN
RATE.—The plan 
sponsor of a legacy plan from time to time 
may adjust the transition contribution rate 
or rates applicable to an employer under this 
paragraph by increasing some rates and de-
creasing others if the actuary certifies that 
such adjusted rates in combination will 
produce projected contribution income for 
the plan year beginning on or after the date 
of certification that is not less than would be 
produced by the transition contribution 
rates in effect at the time of the certifi-
cation.

ceding 5 plan years, and is projected to re-
main fully funded for at least the following 
4 plan years.

value of the amounts contributed with re-
spect to the participants whose benefits are 
being transferred, adjusted for allocable dis-
tributions, investment gains and losses, and 
administrative expenses. 
A plan which is not a composite plan may 
not merge with or transfer assets and liabil-
ities to a composite plan. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY PLAN.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—After a merger or trans-
fer involving a composite plan, the legacy

ligated to contribute to the resulting com-
posite plan is the legacy plan that applied to 
that employer immediately before the merg-
er or transfer. 
‘‘(2) MULTIPLE
LEGACY
PLANS.—If an em-
ployer is obligated to contribute to more 
than one legacy plan with respect to employ-
ees eligible to accrue benefits under more 
than one composite plan and there is a merg-
er or transfer of such legacy plans, the tran-
sition contribution rate applicable to the

Mr. 
DAINES, Mr. BARRASSO, Mrs. CAPITO, 
and Mr. LEE) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Finance: 
S. RES. 804 
Whereas, pursuant to section 2(b)(1) of the 
Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301(b)(1)), it 
is the policy of the United States to ‘‘pro-
mote extensive, close, and friendly commer-
cial, cultural, and other relations between 
the people of the United States and the peo-
ple on Taiwan’’; 
Whereas the friendship between the United 
States and Taiwan is based on a shared com-
mitment to individual and economic free-
dom, shared values, and an appreciation for 
the blessings of liberty and democracy; 
Whereas the United States and Taiwan 
enjoy a robust trade partnership, marked by 
the exchange of goods and services and inter-
national travel; 
Whereas Taiwan has shown an interest in 
strengthening its economic relationship with 
the United States by investing in technology 
manufacturing facilities located within the 
United States and agreeing to lift restric-
tions on the importation of certain United 
States agricultural products; 
Whereas Taiwan has demonstrated a com-
mitment to protecting intellectual property 
and individual freedom by serving as a leader 
in the responsible development of tech-
nology, as evidenced through a Joint Dec-
laration on 5G Security announced between 
the American Institute in Taiwan and the 
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representa-
tive Office in August 2020; 
Whereas Taiwan has played an integral 
role in the global supply chain during the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (commonly known 
as ‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic, producing mass 
amounts of masks at the time when masks 
were most scarce and ensuring that this crit-
ical tool was available to individuals around 
the world; 
Whereas the United States has consist-
ently supported peaceful relations between 
Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, 
and respected the provisions of both the Tai-
wan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and 
the Six Assurances offered by President Ron-
ald Reagan to Taiwan in 1982; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has 
shown a hostility to Taiwan, aggressively as-
serting its military power, using coercive 
economic measures to keep Taiwan economi-
cally dependent on the People’s Republic of 
China, and seeking to isolate Taiwan from 
the rest of the world; 
Whereas the policy of the United States is 
to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific re-
gion, and achieving that vision must include 
working with like-minded countries in the 
region to liberalize trade; 
Whereas the United States is currently 
Taiwan’s 2nd largest trading partner, and 
Taiwan is the 10th largest trading partner of 
the United States in goods and 11th largest 
trading partner overall; 
Whereas Taiwan has been a member of the 
World Trade Organization since 2002; 
Whereas bilateral trade in goods between 
Taiwan and the United States increased from 
$62,000,000,000 in 2010 to $86,000,000,000 in 2019, 
according to the United States Census Bu-
reau; 
Whereas Taiwan’s foreign direct invest-
ment stock in the United States was 
$11,100,000,000 as of 2019; 
Whereas trade with Taiwan supports an es-
timated 208,000 United States jobs according 
to estimates of the United States Depart-
ment of Commerce as of 2015; 
Whereas closer engagement with Taiwan 
through trade negotiations would encourage 
even greater access to Taiwan’s market and 
would benefit both security and economic 
growth for the United States, Taiwan, and 
the Indo-Pacific region; 
Whereas it is essential that a free trade 
agreement negotiated between the United 
States and Taiwan lower tariff and nontariff 
barriers to trade, including meaningfully ex-
panded access to agricultural markets and 
ensuring that science-based standards govern 
international trade in animals and animal 
products; 
Whereas 
the 
Bipartisan 
Congressional 
Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 
2015 (19 U.S.C. 4201 et seq.) enables the Presi-
dent to negotiate reciprocal reductions of 
nontariff barriers while preserving the au-
thority of Congress over foreign trade as re-
quired by section 8 of article I of the Con-
stitution of the United States; 
Whereas the procedures laid out in the Bi-
partisan Congressional Trade Priorities and 
Accountability Act of 2015 were designed by 
Congress to maintain the sovereignty of Con-
gress over trade; and 
Whereas, for legislation implementing a 
trade agreement to qualify for trade authori-
ties procedures under the Bipartisan Con-
gressional Trade Priorities and Account-
ability Act of 2015, the trade agreement is re-
quired to make progress toward achieving 
the applicable objectives, policies, and prior-
ities set forth by Congress in that Act, and 
failure by the administration of a President 
to adhere to the trade negotiating objectives 
and notification and consultation require-
ments established by Congress renders a 
trade agreement ineligible for fast-track 
consideration: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the United States should initiate nego-
tiations to enter into a free trade agreement 
with Taiwan.

(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing:

health condition that could result in death. 
(2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poi-
soning from motor vehicles and improper op-
eration of fuel-burning appliances, such as 
furnaces, water heaters, portable generators, 
and stoves, annually kills more than 400 in-
dividuals and sends approximately 15,000 in-
dividuals to hospital emergency rooms for 
treatment. 
(3) Research shows that installing carbon 
monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas 
in residential homes and other dwelling 
units can help avoid fatalities. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Congress should promote the 
installation of carbon monoxide alarms in 
residential homes and dwelling units across

SA 2715. Mr. BRAUN (for Mr. MORAN) 
proposed an amendment to the bill S. 
3248, to reauthorize the United States 
Anti-Doping Agency, and for other pur-
poses; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United 
States Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States Anti-Doping Agen-
cy— 
(A) is the independent national anti-doping 
organization of the United States; and 
(B) manages the anti-doping program, re-
sults management processes, drug reference 
resources, and athlete education for all 
United States Olympic Committee-recog-
nized national governing bodies and the ath-
letes and events of such national governing 
bodies. 
(2) The United States Anti-Doping Agency 
contributes to the advancement of clean 
sport 
through 
scientific 
research, 
anti- 
doping education, and outreach programs, 
and the mission of the United States Anti- 
Doping Agency is to preserve the integrity of 
competition and protect the rights of ath-
letes. 
(3) Participation in youth sports has the 
potential to equip young athletes with im-
portant skills and values necessary for suc-
cess in life, and it is essential that the cul-
ture of youth sports emphasizes such skills 
and values. 
(4) The TrueSport program of the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency partners with 
youth sport organizations across the United 
States to promote sportsmanship, character 
building, and healthy performance through 
the use of targeted educational materials de-
signed to promote a positive youth sport ex-
perience. 
(5) In modifying the authority of the 
United States Anti-Doping Agency to in-
clude the promotion of the positive values of 
youth sport, Congress sends a strong signal 
that the goals of youth sport should include 
instilling in young athletes the values of in-
tegrity, respect, teamwork, courage, and re-
sponsibility. 
(6) Due to the unique leadership position of 
the United States in the global community, 
adequate funding of the anti-doping and 
clean sport programs of the United States 
Anti-Doping Agency is imperative to the 
preparation for the 2028 Summer Olympic 
Games, which will be held in Los Angeles, 
California. 
(7) Increased appropriations for fiscal years 
2021 through 2029 would enable the United 
States Anti-Doping Agency to directly affect 
the integrity and well-being of sport, both 
domestically and internationally. 
SEC. 3. MODIFICATIONS OF AUTHORITY.

SUPPORTING H.R. 1375, THE PRO-
VIDE 
ACCURATE 
INFORMATION 
DIRECTLY ACT 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1375, the Provide Ac-
curate Information Directly (or PAID) Act which 
includes an important provision amending the 
Medicare Secondary Payer Act. That provision 
facilitates expanded communication between 
the Medicare program and insurers and self- 
insured entities settling liability, no-fault, and 
workers’ compensation claims with Medicare 
beneficiaries who may be covered by a Medi-
care Advantage (Part C) Plan or Medicare 
Prescription Drug (Part D) Plan. This is impor-
tant for Medicare beneficiaries, who today re-
solve claims around a car crash or a slip and 
fall, but because of the way the law works can 
later be sued by a Medicare Advantage Plan 
for repayment. It has happened before—the 
PAID Act will fix that problem and allow bene-
ficiaries to sleep at night knowing that they 
have fully resolved their claims. 
Congress amended the MSP statute in 2007 
through Section 111 of the MMSEA to require 
parties to a dispute (known as ‘‘Primary 
Plans’’) to report settlements, judgments and 
awards to Medicare, called ‘‘Section 111 Re-
ports.’’ That allowed Medicare to seek recov-
ery from settling parties under the Act when 
Medicare paid for health care because other 
payment was not available or reasonably ex-
pected to be available. While that program has 
been successful for the Medicare fee-for-serv-
ice program, where the Center for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS) has the claims 
data for recovery, it has not been as success-
ful for the Part C and Part D programs, where 
CMS does not have the Part C and Part D 
claims data and cannot recover for payments 
that have been made. To compound the prob-
lem, settling parties are often unable to iden-
tify the correct Part C or Part D plan to be 
able to coordinate benefits should they choose 
to do so. The PAID Act closes that critical in-
formation gap, by having CMS communicate 
the Part C and Part D plan identification to 
settling parties in response to a Section 111 
Report. CMS has that data and can provide it. 
Congress is aware that for the last eight 
years CMS has provided all Section 111 Re-
ports to the Part C and Part D Plans, and 
Congress expects that CMS will continue to 
do so after this legislation is enacted. Further, 
the existing MSP statute and regulations im-
pose specific requirements on CMS, and on 
Part C and Part D Plans, to pay for claims in 
some situations, to not pay for claims in other 
situations, and to pursue recovery of claims 
when appropriate. Nothing in this legislation is 
intended to change any of those obligations or 
requirements, and Congress expects Part C 
and Part D Plans to continue to seek recovery 
of claims by timely notifying settling parties 
when a payment has been made that should 
be reimbursed, consistent with the CMS notice 
procedures. This legislation is only intended to 
provide more information to the settling par-
ties, so that they have the ability to coordinate 
with Part C and Part D Plans earlier if they so 
choose. 
Congress has afforded CMS 18 months to 
implement this law and urges CMS to move 
with all deliberate speed to both implement its 
own system changes and coordinate with all 
Primary Plans throughout the implementation 
process. Regular communication and coordi-
nation will be critical to ensuring that Primary 
Plans are aware of the data exchange require-
ments that CMS plans to implement, and to 
ensure that Primary Plans are prepared as 
quickly as possible to utilize the data CMS will 
be providing under this law. By involving all 
stakeholders throughout the implementation 
process, CMS can implement our intention 
that the needed Plan identity information be 
available for parties to coordinate benefits as 
quickly as possible. 
I urge my colleagues to support this fix.

URBAN FARMING 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak on the importance of urban farming. 
Urban Farming first had its start during 
World War II where it supplied over 40 percent 
of produce. 
But in recent days, it is making a comeback, 
and just in time. As our population grows, it is 
unrealistic to expect that urban farming will 
meet all of our food needs. 
But, it will most certainly make a dent. But 
it will also do other things. It will encourage 
healthier diets, which is a much-needed skill 
for many in urban areas, who often resort to 
fast food and other conveniences of big city 
life. 
It will also do must erode the large caloric 
diets that many in cities follow. Urban farming 
also bolsters local communities by bringing 
folks together, which itself foster greater col-
laboration and understanding of other people. 
It can deliver produce at a lower cost, leav-
ing families to spend on other costs of living, 
like housing. 
It can also be good for the environment, as 
it can reduce CO2 emissions attendant with 
transporting food from faraway farms to urban 
centers. 
And, it can also be another source of minor-
ity entrepreneurship by encouraging ownership 
of these farming centers with those who live in 
the buildings where the food is grown. 
There are many benefits to this practice and 
I hope that we can take advantage of them in 
the days ahead. 
IN HONOR OF JAYME ORR RHODES 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Jayme Orr 
Rhodes of Blair County, Pennsylvania for her 
service to Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional 
District on the 2020 U.S. Service Academy 
Nomination Committee. 
Nominating exceptional candidates to attend 
our nation’s service academies is one of my 
most important responsibilities in Congress. 
During this process, I rely on members of the 
Service 
Academy 
Nomination 
Committee, 
which is comprised of dedicated volunteers 
who have served our nation with distinction. 
Jayme is one of nine academy alumni who 
graciously volunteered their time to meet with 
and evaluate perspective nominees for the 
Class of 2025. As a graduate of the United 
States Military Academy in West Point, New 
York, Jayme knows firsthand the qualities and 
dedication that are critical for succeeding at 
the academies. She provided wise counsel 
and expertise throughout the nominating proc-
ess, and I am grateful for her time and com-
mitment. 
Jayme Orr Rhodes is an outstanding Penn-
sylvanian and American, as well as an excel-
lent role model for future academy students. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, 
it is my honor to recognize Jayme for her 
service to our community and our nation.

EAGLE SCOUTS 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize three exceptional students from 
Florida’s Second Congressional District who 
will soon earn the esteemed Eagle Scout rank. 
Corey Phelps and Sean Farnsley, of Port 
St. Joe, Florida, recently completed their com-
munity service projects to meet the require-
ments for the Eagle Scout rank. 
Sean’s Eagle project was to build a butterfly 
garden and reflecting area at the Constitution 
Convention Museum State Park in Port St. 
Joe. 
Corey’s project was to build a flag deposit 
box out of steel for the John C. Gainous Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars Post 10069. 
This is the first time in Troop 347’s exist-
ence that two scouts have become members 
of the 2020 Gulf Coast Council Eagle Class. 
It has also been approximately twenty-four 
years since Port St. Joe has had its last Eagle 
Scout. 
But they weren’t the only ones making his-
tory. 
Macey Hartman of Chiles High School in 
Tallahassee, Florida will be a part of the na-
tional inaugural class of female Eagle Scouts.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JUDGE 
MARTHA WALSH HOOD 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Judge Martha Walsh 
Hood, who has been a New York Family Court 
Judge in Onondaga County for 20 years. 
Judge Walsh Hood has been a dedicated pub-
lic servant and a strong advocate for Central 
New York families throughout her career, and 
I am honored to know her. 
After graduating from Syracuse University 
College of Law in 1979, Judge Walsh Hood 
began a long and respectable career as a law-
yer. In 2000, Judge Walsh Hood was ap-
pointed as a Family Court Judge for New 
York’s fifth judicial district and was subse-
quently designated as an acting State Su-
preme Court Justice. Additionally, she was the 
Presiding Justice of the Onondaga Integrated 
Domestic Violence Court, which she helped 
found, until June of 2005. 
Throughout her career, Judge Walsh Hood 
has displayed a strong commitment to pre-
serving the integrity of the law and advocating 
for the children and families of Central New 
York. She has repeatedly demonstrated the 
strength of her character through her fairness, 
unmatched work ethic, and her dedication to 
public service. During her time at the New 
York Family Court, she helped create and or-
ganize the annual National Adoption Day cele-
bration in Central New York. Each year on Na-
tional Adoption Day, judges from courts 
around Central New York volunteer to finalize 
numerous adoptions and celebrate their new 
families while raising awareness of the thou-
sands of children in foster care. Judge Walsh 
Hood generously volunteers each year to or-
ganize this important event as a demonstra-
tion of her commitment to Central New York 
families. 
Outside of her career, Judge Walsh Hood is 
a dedicated wife to her husband, Paul, and a 
loving mother to her two children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the distin-
guished career of Martha Walsh Hood. A dedi-
cated public servant, I wish Judge Walsh 
Hood the best in her retirement.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
HON. JUDGE ERNESTINE S. GRAY 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the retirement of the Honorable Judge 
Ernestine S. Gray who served as a judge in 
the Orleans Parish Juvenile Court in New Or-
leans for over 35 years. 
A native of South Carolina, Judge Ernestine 
S. Gray was educated in Orangeburg before 
graduating from Spelman College in 1971 and 
Louisiana State University Law Center in 
1976. Prior to her election to the Orleans Par-
ish Juvenile Court, Judge Gray was involved 
in private practice. During her career in public 
service she worked in the Louisiana Attorney 
General’s office focusing on antitrust law 
issues and the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) as a trial attorney. 
From the beginning of her career, Judge 
Gray has dedicated herself to the juvenile jus-
tice system. She demonstrated that commit-
ment through her work at the Baton Rouge 
Legal Aid Society where she presided over 
several family law cases. Judge Gray also 
held various president level positions at the 
National Council of Juvenile and Family Court 
Judges, National CASA, and the local YWCA 
amongst others. Currently, she serves as the 
president of the Pelican Center for Children 
and Families. 
A highly respected public servant, and 
member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., 
Judge Gray is the recipient of numerous 
awards including the 2018 American Bar 
Foundation Outstanding Service Award, the 
2013 City Business Leadership in Law Award, 
the 2011 Louisiana Association of Black 
Woman Attorney’s Trailblazer Award, the 2008 
Honorary Membership for the Louisiana Chap-
ter of the Order of the Coif, the 2004 recipient 
of Spirit of Crazy Horse Award Reclaiming 
Youth International, the 2002 Albert Elias 
Award for Advancement of Compassionate 
Care of Troubled Youth, the National Council 
on Crime and Delinquency Prevention, and 
the 1995 American Bar Association Franklin 
D. Flaschner Judicial Award. 
Judge Gray had an extraordinary judicial ca-
reer and truly made a substantial impact on 
the lives of children and families in New Orle-
ans. We cannot match the sacrifices made by 
Judge Gray, but surely we can try to match 
her sense of service. We cannot match her 
courage, but we can strive to match her devo-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the retirement 
of the Honorable Judge Ernestine S. Gray.

RECOGNIZING NOLAN MEJIA AS 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize local Carlsbad teen, 
Nolan Mejia, as my December Constituent of 
the Month. As the COVID–19 pandemic 
spread in our communities, 17-year-old Nolan 
saw an opportunity to ease the struggles of 
his neighbors and friends. After witnessing his 
own grandparents have nearby family mem-
bers do their grocery shopping, he worried for 
those that did not have anyone to do the 
same for them. 
Feeling inspired by his own family’s kind-
ness, Mejia started the Grocery Grab service. 
Run by himself and a few of his classmates 
from Sage Creek High School in Carlsbad, the 
free grocery shopping service is designed to 
accommodate 
those 
who 
are 
immunocompromised and advised to stay at 
home to prevent exposure to COVID–19. So 
far, the group has delivered over 7,000 items 
to various seniors in the community, with any 
tips received for their services donated to the 
San Diego COVID–19 Community Response 
Fund. 
While the pandemic continues to impact our 
communities in North County San Diego and 
South Orange County, it is absolutely vital that 
we embrace teamwork and togetherness. I am 
incredibly encouraged by the enthusiasm and 
charity of Nolan and his Grocery Grab staff for 
rising to the moment on the behalf of those 
CA–49 residents in need. In order to get 
through this unprecedented time, it’s important 
that we support our most vulnerable neigh-
bors. I am deeply grateful for Nolan’s service 
to our District, and I am proud to recognize 
him as my Constituent of the Month.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

December 17, 2020 
Journalism, and we both began our careers in 
elected office in the Oregon State Legislature. 
We both started in the Oregon House, we 
were both appointed to the Oregon Senate, 
and we both served in leadership there before 
joining Congress. 
Congressman WALDEN was first elected to 
the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999, 
and his ascent in Congress, in both leadership 
positions in his party and on some of our most 
powerful committees, brought central, eastern, 
and southern Oregon to the table during the 
most pressing policy debates of the past two 
decades. Although Congressman WALDEN and 
I didn’t agree on every vote, we worked to-
gether to find areas of common ground that 
helped Oregonians by advancing good poli-
cies. I am grateful for his most recent work to 
bring more resources to those with opioid ad-
diction, and for our work together on wildfire 
relief. In this time of great division, I greatly 
admire Congressman WALDEN’s lifelong com-
mitment to serving with integrity, honesty, and 
humility. He puts pen to paper and does the 
hard work that’s needed to serve his constitu-
ents and move our country forward. When I 
first joined the Oregon delegation, he wel-
comed me with kind words on the House floor 
and then invited me to the House dining room 
for lunch, a gesture that meant a lot to me as 
a new member of Congress. I will miss our 
chance to catch up on long flights to and from 
Oregon, and I’II certainly miss having a fellow 
Duck in the delegation. 
I offer my congratulations to Congressman 
WALDEN, as he closes this chapter of his ca-
reer dedicated to helping others, and I know 
he will continue serving his community and 
Oregonians in new ways in the years ahead. 
Best wishes to him and his family.

HONORING MARY MORIARTY 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mary Moriarty, who embodies what it 
means to be a public defender. For 30 years, 
Ms. Moriarty has dedicated herself to the Hen-
nepin County Chief Public Defender’s Office. 
Her tireless commitment to our community, 
providing quality representation to our most 
marginalized and vulnerable neighbors should 
not go unappreciated. 
Ms. Moriarty was appointed Chief Public 
Defender in 2014. Her leadership resulted in 
significant reforms, providing ample and often 
training to new lawyers, bringing in social 
workers for misdemeanor cases, and requiring 
lawyers to have knowledge in forensic science 
and DNA analysis. 
An evaluation from the National Center for 
State Courts Public Defender’s Office under 
Ms. Moriarty’s leadership validated that she 
runs one of the best public defender offices in 
the country, one that is as successful as a pri-
vate firm. Dr. Brian Ostrom stated this: ‘‘let me 
say unequivocally that Ms. Moriarty is the 
most accomplished, passionate, and articulate 
public defender I have ever met.’’ 
In her tenure Ms. Moriarty has been a de-
voted champion in addressing the racial in-
equalities in the justice system: whether that 
be advocating for more awareness of implicit 
bias for jurors, or requesting data that shows 
police disproportionately stop and charge Afri-
can American’s with obstruction of justice, 
compared to Caucasians. Ms. Moriarty has 
first-hand seen the disparities that impact our 
community through the legal system and has 
worked diligently to reform them. 
To me, Ms. Moriarty represents what the 
standard should be for a public defender: 
someone who is committed to their clients and 
provides service to the highest of their ability, 
someone willing to call out the injustices and 
inequalities our neighbors endure, and working 
to reform them. Ms. Moriarty deserves the up-
most admiration for continuing the good fight 
of improving our justice system, even in the 
face of considerable pushback. 
I thank Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty 
for her service to our community. It has been 
an honor to work alongside her to make our 
state, country and justice system a better, fair-
er place.

RECOGNIZING LIZ MCBRIDE 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of our 
finest House servants, director of the Office of 
Employee Assistance, Liz McBride. Through-
out her nearly thirty-year tenure with the office 
she has worked tirelessly to meet the needs of 
Members, their families, and the staff of the 
U.S. House—often meeting outside of normal 
business hours to ensure they received the 
support they needed. As Director of the office, 
Liz has gifted the House with a new vision— 
expanding confidential counseling and bringing 
a new focus to health with the establishment 
of the House Wellness Center. Throughout 
this pandemic, Liz and her office have played 
an essential role in helping Members and staff 
work through what has been for many a dif-
ficult year. Liz is leaving us with a bright vision 
for the future and a legacy worth emulating. 
Her retirement is a genuine loss for us and 
this institution, and I am grateful for her years 
of dedicated service to our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF RANDY 
CLINTON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Randy Clinton, the President & 
CEO of the Community Enrichment Center, 
who will be retiring after 25 years of faithful 
leadership of the Tarrant County non-profit. 
Mr. Clinton received his Bachelor of Science 
in Education from Abilene Christian University, 
where he demonstrated his leadership skills 
through his role as the ACU Band Drum 
Major. After graduation, he initially served as 
Director of Recruiting at Abilene Christian, be-
fore his career path took him to Granbury 
where he opened a restaurant, and then 
moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area for a 13- 
year career in banking. His varied background 
experience in the recruitment, business and fi-
nance fields provided him the skills that would 
prove necessary for the challenges he would 
eventually face with the Community Enrich-
ment Center. 
Established in 1988, Randy joined the orga-
nization already in existence, but brought his 
personal and business skills to effectively 
manage and expand the organization’s original 
mission to serve Northeast Tarrant County’s 
growing community needs. The area’s ex-
panding population brought an ever-increasing 
need for assistance from individuals and fami-
lies facing homelessness or other forms of 
personal crisis. To address the challenge, 
Randy led the acquisition and sale of several 
properties through debt-free operation and 
management of 206 properties. This effort to 
assist struggling families also involved offering 
additional 
support 
services 
including 
the 
CEC’s Food Pantry, GED completion classes 
and other programs to improve job opportuni-
ties and wages to move individuals out of pov-
erty to self-sufficiency. 
This mission expanded significantly with the 
merger of CEC with Open Arms Home, Inc., 
allowing an even greater ability for Randy and 
his team to aid families in transition. It also ex-
panded the capacity of CEC to assist victims 
of domestic violence by providing them the 
time and space necessary to work through 
their challenges in a healthy and supportive 
environment. Funding these efforts without 
debt required not only efficient management 
skills, but also creative funding. CEC, through 
Randy’s efforts, was successful in securing, 
and successfully managing, a number of fed-
eral grants including Victims of Crime Assist-
ance (VOCA), Other Victim Assistance Grant 
(OVAG), and HUD Homeless Housing grants. 
These grant funds, as well as other funding 
streams, supported the CEC’s offerings to 
those in need, such as adult literacy programs 
and VITA Free Tax Preparation. 
His service wasn’t limited to his official du-
ties at the CEC. Mr. Clinton served his fellow 
North Texans through participation in several 
area boards, including the Northeast Leader-
ship Forum, Northeast Tarrant Chamber of 
Commerce, the Northeast Richland Lions 
Club, the Joint Advisory Council for JPS Hos-
pital and the United Way Northeast Steering 
Committee. He also shared his personal time 
and leadership skills as Board Chairman of 
the Northeast Tarrant Chamber of Commerce, 
the Texas Homeless Network, Mid Cities 
Pacesetters Rotary, Tarrant County Con-
tinuum of Care for the Homeless, United Way 
Agency Partners and the Saginaw Area 
Chamber. He was also a founding member of 
Summer Santa and serves actively at The 
Hills Church of Christ as Elder and Class 
Leader. 
Randy Clinton successfully bridged his per-
sonal faith and professional skills as a com-
passionate community steward, leading the 
CEC to offer practical resources, tools and en-
couragement to community members in need. 
Thanks to his committed engagement, families 
have found transitional resources to move 
from crisis to stability and break the cycles of 
poverty and family violence. Bringing hope to 
current, and future generations of North Texas 
residents, Randy has made an indelible mark 
through his service with Community Enrich-
ment Center. On behalf of the 26th Congres-
sional District, I wish him and his family the 
same success and fulfillment his efforts over

IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak about the importance of housing. 
Housing is a basic human necessity. 
Across our country, housing affordability is 
among the most difficult challenges facing cit-
ies today. 
The metropolitan Atlanta region is no excep-
tion. 
In 2017, Atlanta was the third fastest grow-
ing metropolitan region in the U.S. 
If we want to fulfill our most basic promise 
on achieving the American Dream, then we 
must make affordable housing opportunities a 
reality. 
A rule of personal bookkeeping is that you 
should spend no more than 30 percent of your 
income on housing. 
But in many places, that cost is too high. 
For many still, who cannot these rates, we 
must make public housing more affordable. 
In Atlanta, we have a tremendous oppor-
tunity to expedite the redevelopment of vacant 
public housing sites including: Bowen Homes, 
Bankhead Court, Hollywood court, Harris 
Homes, Thomasville, and Jonesboro North 
and South. 
All of these sites have the potential to not 
only incorporate affordable housing, but the 
addition of grocery stores in food desserts; 
healthcare facilities, improved access to public 
transportation; job and commercial centers, 
quality schools and parks and greenspace. 
We have seen this model created in other 
development projects including the Bedford 
Pines transformation into City Lights, Eastlake, 
Centennial Place and the newly renovated 
Wheat Street Towers. 
The activation of these vacant sites could 
create thousands of units of affordable hous-
ing—ensuring that one’s zip code does not de-
termine their economic mobility.

IN HONOR OF BILL WARD, JR. 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Bill Ward, Jr. of 
Blair County, Pennsylvania for his service to 
Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District on 
the 2020 U.S. Service Academy Nomination 
Committee. 
Nominating exceptional candidates to attend 
our nation’s service academies is one of my 
most important responsibilities in Congress. 
During this process, I rely on members of the 
Service 
Academy 
Nomination 
Committee, 
which is comprised of dedicated volunteers 
who have served our nation with distinction. 
Bill is one of nine academy alumni who gra-
ciously volunteered their time to meet with and 
evaluate perspective nominees for the Class 
of 2025. As a graduate of the U.S. Naval 
Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Bill knows 
firsthand the qualities and dedication that are 
critical for succeeding at the academies. He 
provided wise counsel and expertise through-
out the nominating process, and I am grateful 
for his time and commitment. 
Bill Ward, Jr. is an outstanding Pennsylva-
nian and American, as well as an excellent 
role model for future academy students. On 
behalf of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, it is 
my honor to recognize Bill for his service to 
our community and our nation.

HONORING MY CHIEF OF STAFF 
BRIAN THOMAS 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to my first and only Chief 
of Staff, Brian Thomas. I have had the high 
honor of serving in Congress since 2005, and 
Brian Thomas has been my right-hand man 
every step of the way on this amazing journey. 
Through the good days and the most difficult 
ones, Brian has been a constant professional 
and source of wise counsel. I consider myself 
very fortunate and blessed to have only had 
one Chief of Staff during my entire service in 
the House, and I could not have asked for a 
better man for the job than Brian Thomas. 
Brian will soon retire as the Dean of the Texas 
Republican Chiefs of Staff, an honor he has 
held for the last several years. 
Brian’s service to the people of his home 
state of Texas did not start in my office, as he 
worked for our former colleagues Sam John-
son and Jeb Hensarling, in addition to our cur-
rent colleague MAC THORNBERRY. Hailing from 
Denver City, Texas and a graduate of 
McMurry University in Abilene, Brian never for-
got his Texan roots, though he did do two 
tours outside of the Texas delegation for Char-
lie Norwood and Chuck Hagel. Brian cele-
brates a collective twenty-five years of Con-
gressional service this month, a truly out-
standing accomplishment that only a small 
number of Congressional staffers ever reach. 
We could not do our jobs without the dedi-
cated service of our staff who are always 
working behind the scenes. Brian’s advice, ex-
perience, and especially his hard work, which 
often occurs at odd hours of the day and 
night, have all played a large role in helping 
me best represent the 24th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Brian will be greatly missed by so many 
upon his retirement as a Congressional staff-
er. His constant service is something not often 
found on the Hill, where frequent transitions 
are the norm. Throughout his career, Brian 
served as a mentor to staffers in not only my 
office, but also to those working for other 
members. No task was ever too big or too 
small for Brian, from answering the main line 
of the office telephone, to dealing with intense 
negotiations with leadership, Brian was always 
there for me and his colleagues. I hope that in 
the coming years, Brian’s friends and col-
leagues will continue to ask for his sage ad-
vice—once a hill staffer, always a hill staffer. 
I congratulate Brian on his remarkable twen-
ty-five years of Congressional service and for 
leading my Washington, D.C. office for the 
people of the 24th Congressional district the 
last sixteen years. I wish him, his wonderful 
wife Amy, and their three adorable children, 
Allie Ross, Jack, and John all the very best for 
the holiday season and a well-earned Con-
gressional retirement for Brian.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
JOE KRAUS AND MATT PROUTY 
WITH PROJECT VISION 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Joe Kraus and Matt Prouty for their 
service 
to 
Project 
VISION 
of 
Rutland, 
Vermont. Both Joe and Matt will soon be end-
ing their impressive service to Project VISION 
after years of success helping Rutland build a 
better, stronger community. 
Formed in 2013 at the height of Rutland’s 
opioid crisis, Project VISION has celebrated 
two core values since its founding: collabora-
tion for the greater good and focus on the 
positives that make Rutland a special commu-
nity. The former Chief of Police for the City of 
Rutland, James Baker, spearheaded the cre-
ation of Project VISION with the enthusiastic 
support of Mayor Christopher Louras and the 
Board of Alderman. These leaders recognized 
that the community’s challenges were not 
going to be fixed by making more arrests, so 
they sought community partners to build real 
and substantive change. 
With passion and hard work, Joe Kraus and 
Matt Prouty have helped Project VISION lead 
a diverse coalition of over 300 social and 
health service agencies and organizations, 
who are united in their goal of making Rutland 
one of the healthiest, safest and happiest 
places in America. Project VISION’s allies in-
clude the Rutland Regional Medical Center, 
the Rutland City Police Department, Rutland 
City Public Schools, Rutland Regional Plan-
ning Commission, NeighborWorks, and the 
Southwestern Vermont Council on Aging. 
In its early years, the coalition concentrated 
on treating addiction and substance abuse, re-
ducing crime, and building great neighbor-
hoods. Their success was impressive. A sur-
vey conducted in Rutland’s Northwest neigh-
borhood just three years after Project VISION 
was founded showed that people felt safer, 
had a more trusting relationship with law en-
forcement, and were proud of their neighbor-
hood. 
Thanks to the work of Joe and Matt, Project 
VISION continues to grow. It has expanded its 
work beyond opioid addiction to address larger 
health and welfare issues affecting Rutland. 
Most recently, the organization announced 
that it would focus on reforming systems that 
relate to social and racial justice. 
I am proud to say that Rutland’s future is 
bright. This is a community that has worked 
together to accomplish their common vision of 
a stronger Rutland. My thanks to Joe Kraus 
and Matt Prouty for stepping forward with en-
ergy and commitment to ensure the success 
of Project VISION. Their work has made a 
positive difference that will be felt by genera-
tions to come.

HONORING BENJAMIN MILLER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of myself and our former 
House colleague, the great George Miller. To-
gether, we wish to honor Benjamin 
(Ben) Miller who served each of us, and our 
country, with distinction for the past eighteen 
years. Ben departs the Hill on January 1, 2021 
after eight years as my Chief of Staff, and be-
fore that a decade in Congressman Miller’s of-
fice where he worked his way up from intern, 
to Legislative Assistant, to Legislative Director, 
to Deputy Chief of Staff. Throughout the Cap-
itol and on both sides of the aisle, Ben has 
earned the respect, admiration, and affection 
of his peers. His tenure in the House is the 
very model of public service. 
When I was first elected to Congress in 
2012, I sought out Ben knowing that his tal-
ents, experience and disposition would make 
him a great Chief of Staff. He exceeded my 
highest expectations. He helped me assemble 
a quality staff team and establish an office cul-
ture that reflects a strong work ethic, a fun 
and collegial environment, and a constant 
focus on carrying out our progressive policy 
agenda and getting things done. Ben never 
sought attention or personal recognition; he 
just did excellent work, usually behind the 
scenes. 
Like Congressman Miller and myself, Ben 
shares a passion for the sustainable manage-
ment of our natural resources. Throughout his 
career on the Hill, Ben has been a friend to 
flora and fauna, a champion of bedrock envi-
ronmental laws like NEPA and the Endan-
gered Species Act, and a happy warrior in de-
fense of our great American outdoors and the 
people and organizations that passionately 
work for its protection. 
Longtime staffers and outside experts can 
attest that Ben is a subject matter guru on 
what is arguably the most intricate, combus-
tible, and Byzantine issue of all: California 
water. Ben understands that California water 
conflicts sometimes require you to fight, which 
is easy enough to do; but he also knows that 
achieving meaningful, durable results requires 
you to do the much harder work of engaging 
constructively and solving complex water prob-
lems. 
Beyond his policy expertise and legislative 
acumen, Ben will be remembered fondly by 
Team Huffman for the human qualities that 
were hallmarks of his leadership: honesty, pro-
fessionalism, kindness of spirit, and the good 
humor he brought to work every day. 
Ben is a dedicated husband to Caitlin, and 
a proud father to Sam and Campbell. For rea-
sons I will never understand, he is also a pas-
sionate fan of the San Antonio Spurs, through 
good times and bad. We forgive him for that. 
Madam Speaker, the functioning of our leg-
islative branch which is so vital to our demo-
cratic republic has always depended on 
skilled, dedicated, unheralded congressional 
staffers. For eighteen years, in the most ex-
emplary manner, Ben has provided that es-
sential public service. He has earned the deep 
respect of his peers, and my enduring grati-
tude for being such a wonderful Chief of Staff. 
On behalf of myself, Congressman Miller, 
and dozens of current and former staffers who 
were privileged to work with Ben, we thank 
him for his public service; we thank his family 
for sharing him with us; and we wish him 
much success and happiness in his future en-
deavors.

CELEBRATING IRIS CUMMINGS 
CRITCHELL’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and cele-
brate the 100th birthday of one of my constitu-
ents, Iris Cummings Critchell, a remarkable 
woman who has led an extraordinary life. 
Iris was born on December 21, 1920, in Los 
Angeles, California. She was a competitive 
swimmer in her youth and was the U.S. cham-
pion in the 200-meter breaststroke from 1936 
to 1939. Her hard work and talents led her to 
represent the United States in the 1936 Olym-
pic Games in Berlin. Shortly thereafter, she at-
tended the University of Southern California 
(USC) and graduated in 1941 with a degree in 
physical sciences and mathematics. 
Interested in aviation from an early age, Iris 
was accepted into USC’s first Civilian Pilot 
Training Program in 1939. She received her 
pilot’s license in 1940 and began work as a 
pilot instructor after graduating college. During 
WWII, Iris joined the Women’s Auxiliary 
Ferrying 
Squadron 
(WAFS), 
which 
later 
merged into the Women Airforce Service Pi-
lots (WASP). She served as a member of the 
6th Ferrying Group out of Long Beach, Cali-
fornia, ferrying planes built in Southern Cali-
fornia across the country. During her service, 
she flew 27 different types of military aircraft, 
nearly 30 types of civilian aircraft, and flew 18 
military aircraft as the pilot in command. It was 
during her time in the service that she met her 
husband and fellow military pilot, Howard 
Critchell. 
After the War, Iris returned to the University 
of Southern California to develop and teach a 
curriculum on civilian aviation for returning vet-
erans. In 1962, Iris and Howard joined the fac-
ulty of Harvey Mudd College, where they 
founded the Bates Aeronautics Program, a 
two-year program to teach undergraduates to 
fly. She ran the program with Howard until he 
retired in 1979 and continued alone until the 
program ended in 1990 with her retirement, al-
though she continued to teach aeronautics 
classes until 1996. 
Among her many honors, Iris was inducted 
into the National Flight Instructors Hall of 
Fame in 2000, awarded the Federal Aviation 
Administration’s Wright Brothers Master Pilot 
Award in 2006, and awarded the Nile Gold 
Medal of the Fe´de´ration Ae´ronautique Inter-
nationale in 2007 for her lifetime of dedication 
to aviation education. 
Although she has been retired for 30 years, 
Iris continues to be an active member of both 
the Harvey Mudd College and aviation com-
munities, mentoring students and anyone in-
terested in aviation. She serves as a role 
model for women aviators and is an inspiration 
to all with whom she interacts. It is my distinct 
honor to recognize Iris Cummings Critchell’s 
lifetime service to our country, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in sending our best 
wishes to her and her family as they celebrate 
her 100th birthday on December 21st.

MORRIS BROWN COLLEGE 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, To God and 
Truth. 
That is the motto of Morris Brown College. 
This is a historic institution which was 
founded in 1881 as a private Methodist col-
lege in Atlanta to educate blacks, just 20 
years after the start of the Civil War. 
Unfortunately, over the last 20 years, the 
state of this legendary institution has fallen on 
hard times. 
But true to its tradition and the abolitionist 
mantra to keep going, Morris Brown College 
has developed a plan to come back and be 
reborn. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge this 
body’s support for this plan in two distinct 
ways. 
First, we should reallocate federal funding 
for this place of knowledge and of truth and of 
God. 
And, we should do what we can to reinvest 
in the revitalization of the Atlanta University 
Center. 
If we do this, then the College can repur-
pose itself to the proud tradition of teaching 
the next generation of black scholars the im-
portant lessons of business and entrepreneur-
ship.

SNEADS HIGH SCHOOL 
VOLLEYBALL 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding accomplishments of 
the Sneads High School Volleyball program in 
Sneads, Florida. 
They recently set a new Florida High School 
Athletic Association (FHSAA) record by win-
ning their eighth straight state championship. 
This accomplishment was achieved through 
hard work and excellence. 
This dedicated team was made up of the 
following 
Sneads 
High 
School 
students: 
Caleigh Davis, Brooke A. Smith, Jada Cole-
man, Lily Glover, Kiara Garrett, Sister Arnold, 
Jade 
Fitzsimmons, 
Chloe 
King, 
Katelyn 
Chumly, Taylor-Reese Howell, Janiyah Jones, 
Aaliyah Baker, Brooke R. Smith, Gabby Bel-
lamy, and Ella Sprouse. 
The Sneads High School Volleyball program 
is fortunate to have the leadership of their cur-
rent head coach Heather Edge and former 
head coach Sheila Roberts. 
Coach Roberts started this legacy with five 
consecutive state championships followed by 
Coach Edge raking in three more consecutive 
championships to break the state record for a 
total of eight consecutive state championship 
wins. 
Congratulations to the Sneads High School 
Lady Pirates on this outstanding accomplish-
ment. 
I know that they make their hometown of 
Sneads and the Jackson County School Dis-
trict very proud.

HONORING CHRIS DONESA, COUN-
SEL TO THE RULEMAKING MEM-
BER 
FOR 
THE 
HOUSE 
ETHICS 
COMMITTEE 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay special tribute to a long-standing 
Capitol Hill veteran, Chris Donesa. For this 
Congress, I have had the honor of serving as 
Ranking Member for the House Ethics Com-
mittee, and would like to honor someone who 
played a critical and important role in sup-
porting me. 
For the past two years Chris has served as 
Counsel to the Ranking Member for the House 
Ethics Committee. This is an extraordinary as-
signment to accept, and Chris has conducted 
himself with the highest levels of profes-
sionalism and legal scholarly advice. He has 
been integral and pivotal in assisting my fellow 
Republican Members of the Ethics Committee 
and me this Congress. 
A native of Indiana, Chris has a deep com-
mitment to public service that has continued 
throughout more than three decades of serv-
ice in the House of Representatives. A Con-
gressional jack of all trades, immediately prior 
to his service with the Ethics Committee, Chris 
served as Legal Counsel to the Clerk of the 
House. I am most fortunate that Chris brought 
his vast experiences and great wisdom to help 
my fellow Members of the Ethics Committee 
and me during this Congress. 
The House Ethics Committee is unique 
amongst the committees in this chamber, as it 
is evenly split between the Majority and Minor-
ity parties. The committee fulfils many key 
roles for the House community in providing 
advice, education, and training to help ensure 
proper compliance. Perhaps the most difficult 
assignment for the Ethics Committee is to 
stand in judgment of Members and staffers 
when they are accused of potential wrong-
doing. It takes a very special staffer to serve 
in this role—someone of the highest integrity 
and character, coupled with the desire to 
serve in a position that is often met with 
unique challenges and high stress. I could not 
ask for a better person than Chris to fulfill this 
essential role for me and the greater House 
community. 
Chris has earned himself a well-deserved 
retirement at the conclusion of this Congress. 
However, knowing Chris, I know he won’t sit 
still for long and I wish him all the very best 
for his continued service and new endeavors. 
I ask for all of my colleagues to join me in 
thanking Chris Donesa for his service to the 
House Ethics Committee.

IMPORTANCE OF MINORITY AND 
WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak to the importance of Minority and 
Women owned businesses. 
During the Obama Administration, this body, 
together with our colleagues across the Cap-
itol, passed Dodd-Frank—legendary financial 
reforms in the wake of the great recession. 
One of the key parts of this legislation was 
Section 342, the office of minority and Women 
inclusion. The law ensured the eventual devel-
opment of standards for the following areas: 
Equal employment opportunity and the ra-
cial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the work-
force and senior management of the agency; 
Increased participation of minority-owned 
and women-owned businesses in the pro-
grams and contracts of the agency, including 
standards for coordinating technical assistance 
to such businesses; and 
Assessment of the diversity policies and 
practices of entities regulated by the agency. 
But this cannot be enough. 
We must also ensure that legacy banks and 
black own banks are sources of capital to sup-
port financing of projects for minority commu-
nities. 
We must also ensure that we support the 
MBDA, the Minority Business Development 
Agency. 
The MBDA is the only federal agency 
tasked with promoting the growth and com-
petitiveness of minority-owned businesses. 
Madam Speaker, if we do this, we in this 
Chamber will ensure that the promise of the 
American Dream is within reach of all who 
seek it, especially those groups that have 
been historically marginalized.

IN HONOR OF MICHAEL 
DELGROSSO 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Michael 
DelGrosso of Blair County, Pennsylvania for 
his service to Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District on the 2020 U.S. Service Acad-
emy Nomination Committee. 
Nominating exceptional candidates to attend 
our nation’s service academies is one of my 
most important responsibilities in Congress. 
During this process, I rely on members of the 
Service 
Academy 
Nomination 
Committee, 
which is comprised of dedicated volunteers 
who have served our nation with distinction. 
Michael is one of nine academy alumni who 
graciously volunteered their time to meet with 
and evaluate perspective nominees for the 
Class of 2025. As a graduate of the U.S. 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Mi-
chael knows firsthand the qualities and dedi-
cation that are critical for succeeding at the 
academies. He provided wise counsel and ex-
pertise throughout the nominating process, 
and I am grateful for his time and commit-
ment. 
Michael DelGrosso of Blair County is an 
outstanding Pennsylvanian and American, as 
well as an excellent role model for future 
academy students. On behalf of the 13th Dis-
trict of Pennsylvania, it is my honor to recog-
nize Michael for his service to our community 
and our nation.

HONORING RECIPIENTS OF THE IN-
NOVATION 
AND 
ADAPTATION 
RECOGNITION 
HON. ADRIAN SMITH 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, 
today I honor nine individuals and businesses 
from Nebraska’s Third District for receiving the 
Innovation and Adaptation Recognition. 
Throughout the 75 counties of the Third Dis-
trict, Nebraskans know our communities grow 
when individuals step up: helping their neigh-
bors, being involved, and creating opportuni-
ties for themselves and others. 
In August, I called for nominations as part of 
a new initiative to acknowledge the contribu-
tions of individuals, organizations, and those 
who are working every day to improve and 
help their communities in the current environ-
ment. 
Billy Estes is the Executive Director of the 
Midwest Theater of Scottsbluff. Midwest Thea-
ter’s programming, which includes live per-
formances, orchestras, and concerts, makes 
an important contribution to the cultural and 
social experiences of Nebraska’s panhandle. 
When the Coronavirus pandemic reached 
western Nebraska, under the guidance of Mr. 
Estes, the Midwest Theater partnered with the 
Legacy of the Plains Museum to create the 
Skyview Drive-in Movie Theater. As the pan-
demic progressed, this venture proved so pop-
ular they outgrew their location and had to 
move to larger accommodations. Thanks to 
the creativity and leadership of Mr. Estes, in 
spite of the pandemic, the Midwest Theater 
has continued to thrive throughout 2020. 
Grand Central Foods of York is owned by 
the Warren Thomas family. Mr. Thomas prides 
himself on his commitment to the York com-
munity. In ‘‘normal’’ times, Warren and the 
Grand Central Team are the first to ask where 
they can help with a project or how they can 
partner on events. The selflessness shown by 
everyone at Grand Central is a testament to 
the example of their ownership. Within a few 
days of the pandemic’s arrival to York, Warren 
purchased a second grocery delivery van and 
expanded his service to the entire community. 
Because Warren believes in positive reinforce-
ment, he encouraged his customers to wear a 
mask while in his store by offering a 5 percent 
discount on their purchases. He is an active 
member of many community groups, and his 
passion and commitment to his community are 
unmatched. 
Alyssa Cochnar of Crete is the leader of 
Gold Star Martial Arts of Crete and Seward. At 
26 years old, she is already a 5th-degree 
black belt, chief instructor, and co-owner of 
the martial arts facility. When directed health 
measures forced Gold Star to close in-person 
training classes, she spearheaded the process 
of creating online modules for her students to 
continue their training independently. Before 
long, she began offering Zoom Classes to pro-
vide her students with another safe and flexi-
ble option to continue their training and ex-
plore expanded experiences to encourage 
healthy eating habits and socialization while 
social distancing. I commend her positive atti-
tude and commitment to an enriching edu-
cational experience for all her students, re-
gardless of their experience level. 
Bryce Jensen is the Director of the World 
Theatre of Kearney. His adaptability, espe-
cially during the pandemic, demonstrates his 
commitment to his community. Though the or-
ganization he operates, the World Theatre, 
was closed due to the pandemic, his outside 
of the box thinking inspired him to create, 
through strategic community collaborations, a 
World Theatre drive-in. Not only did this en-
sure the World Theatre could still bring respite 
to many during these trying times, but it re-
stored a drive-in movie experience to the 
Kearney region, reminding many of the happy 
memories of their youth. 
Kirk Zeller grew up in the community of Ra-
venna, Nebraska. After high school, he at-
tended university and later worked in the med-
ical field in Japan, Europe, and the United 
States. Eventually, Kirk returned to his home-
town of Ravenna to raise his family. Since re-
turning to Ravenna, he has turned the former 
Carnegie library into an entrepreneurship cen-
ter, purchased a downtown building and ren-
ovated the upper story apartments, and re-
cently directed a movie in Ravenna and Los 
Angeles which premiered at the Kearney 
World Theatre’s drive-in, all while working on 
bringing new medical products to the market. 
He is a great story of returning to rural Ne-
braska and reinvesting in the community. 
Dick Cochran of Kearney founded the non-
profit Hot Meals USA in October 2017. By 
February 2018, he signed a memorandum of 
understanding with the American Red Cross to 
call on him for assistance in wildfires, floods, 
tornadoes, and other disasters. Every time 
Dick and Hot Meals USA are called upon, no 
less than 150 volunteers have supported the 
program. Since their inception, the policy has 
been to feed anyone, no questions asked. In 
just over three years, they have provided more 
than 155,000 meals across the country. 
John McCoy is the CEO of Orthman Manu-
facturing of Lexington. He embraced the op-
portunity to help feed families who come from 
a poverty background in the Lexington area. 
When he first brought Hot Meals USA to the 
community, Orthman Manufacturing partnered 
with the Lexington Community Foundation and 
others to provide over 1,000 hot meals weekly 
to families. He then made feeding the commu-
nity a priority as he and his employees took 
the lead to distribute USDA food boxes. When 
schools reopened in August, John was there 
for the community again. He donated 3,700 
masks to Lexington Public Schools to make 
sure no student was unprepared for their 
school experience. John’s actions represent 
his commitment to all members of the Lex-
ington community. 
Anthony May of Hastings is an entre-
preneur. When the pandemic forced the tap-
room of Steeple Brewery Anthony co-owns to 
close, he quickly responded. Collaborating 
with Wave Pizza Company, the brewery’s res-
taurant partner, he developed a community 
delivery program, which eventually offered 
their products to 21 communities in south-cen-
tral Nebraska. This innovative program en-
sured many Nebraskans, whose communities 
either do not have a grocery store or now 
lacked a local place to eat due to the pan-
demic restrictions, had ready access to an 
easy to use food delivery program. 
Matt Dennis and Michael Stepp are more 
than small-town business owners; they are 
master storytellers with a dream. What began 
as two friends making copper mugs in an old 
shop has turned into an opportunity to re-
shape the meaning of community. When they 
purchased 
the 
building 
they 
now 
call 
Handlebend, their goal was to create a com-
munity of small businesses under one roof 
and welcome the community with open arms 
to come and enjoy a mule, coffee, or gather 
and with friends and family. Though the 
Coronavirus 
pandemic 
has 
caused 
the 
Handlebend community to adapt their ap-
proach, their dream to create an innovative 
experience for the O’Neill community con-
tinues. 
I am proud to honor these individuals today, 
and I thank them for their many contributions 
to Nebraska.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT 
COMMANDER CAMERON MASSEY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Lieutenant Commander Cam 
Massey, United States Navy, on his service as 
a legislative fellow in my Washington, D.C. of-
fice this year. Cam has played a critical role 
this year supporting my work on the House 
Armed Services Committee and representing 
the proud Navy community in Eastern Con-
necticut. 
As Chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection 
Forces, I have the high honor of overseeing 
much of our nation’s Navy, Marine Corps, and 
various Air Force programs. This year, as our 
subcommittee considered how best to fund 
critical shipbuilding programs, revitalize our 
nation’s sealift, and Navy and Marine Corps 
readiness across the INDOPACOM, Cam pro-
vided critical insight and guidance into how 
our subcommittee could best provide the re-
sources and platforms that our Sailors and 
Marines need to achieve mission success. 
Cam has also seized the initiative in a vari-
ety of areas beyond naval affairs. He worked 
to craft an amendment to this year’s NDAA 
that would prioritize the sourcing and proc-
essing of rare earth minerals from the United 
States and our allies to strengthen our na-
tional security supply chains. He has also 
served as the staff-lead for the Friends of Aus-
tralia Caucus, of which I serve as co-chair, en-
suring that the ties between our countries re-
main as strong as ever as we recently cele-
brated more than 100 years of mateship. 
Cam’s adaptability was put to a severe test 
this year with the onset of the COVID–19 
global pandemic, which completely altered the 
normal operations of our subcommittee. Cam 
was able to work remotely, and performed all 
his assignments without a hitch. 
Cam’s work ethic, character, humor, intel-
ligence, and first-hand experience when it 
comes to nuanced naval affairs made an im-
mediate impact on my office and I know their 
absence will be felt with the same immediacy. 
Cam and his family have made tremendous 
sacrifices for our nation, traveling around the 
world with the fleet. They’ve uprooted their 
family nearly a dozen times in just as many 
years. We’re grateful that they’ve landed close 
to Washington for the time being and thank 
them for always answering our nation’s call 
without hesitation.

December 17, 2020 
Madam Speaker, the Navy’s legislative fel-
lowship program is an invaluable effort that 
benefits members of the House and Senate 
with the insight of junior officers who like Cam, 
bring real world experience from military duty. 
I can honestly say I have learned a great deal 
from Cam’s insights based on his training and 
experience. That has also been the case for 
each of his predecessors that my office has 
had the opportunity to host. I also enjoy 
watching through their eyes the workings of 
Congress, which I’ve come to know from end 
of year debriefs, greatly expanded their under-
standing of the legislative branch of govern-
ment. This recurring process that the fellow-
ship program fosters, strengthens civilian-mili-
tary understanding for future leaders of the 
greatest military in the world, which I believe 
is so important to our democracy. 
Cam is leaving Congress but he isn’t going 
far and will be serving as an Operations Offi-
cer at the National Joint Operations & Intel-
ligence Center, Operations Team Five. I know 
his expertise and humor will be deeply missed 
by both my personal staff and Seapower staff. 
Our nation is best served at sea and here 
on shore by officers and leaders of the highest 
caliber. This perfectly describes Cam, who has 
a promising career ahead as a commander 
and leader in service to our nation. On his 
final month here in Congress, I wish LCDR 
Massey the best of luck in his new role. To 
Cam, his wife Cassidy, their children Avery 
and Colin, Hotty Toddy and War Eagle. Fair 
winds, and following seas, Massey Family.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak about the importance of the United 
States Postal Service. 
The Postal Service is an integral institu-
tion—so integral that its presence in our nation 
is mandated in our founding charter. 
The United States Postal Service is so 
deeply ingrained in our nation’s history, com-
merce, and quality of life, that we can often 
take it for granted. 
In fact, their role in our country’s democracy 
was never more evident than in this last elec-
tion. 
This year in addition to delivering our pre-
scriptions and packages, they also delivered 
our ballots and made sure our voices were 
heard. 
They are the unsung heroes. 
During this holiday season, as we all await 
packages to give to our loved ones, let us not 
forget the Postal workers who deliver more 
than 155 billion pieces of mail per year. 
For their work and commitment this season, 
and every holiday season, I support overtime 
pay. 
It’s time to revisit the idea of mandatory 
overtime and propose a measure that will pro-
vide automatic overtime to workers who ex-
tend their time beyond eight hours a day dur-
ing the holiday season.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
CHIEF JUSTICE BERNETTE JOSH-
UA JOHNSON 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the retirement of Chief Justice Bernette 
Joshua Johnson who serves as the Louisiana 
Supreme Court 25th Chief Justice. She is the 
second female Chief Justice and the Court’s 
first ever African American Chief Justice. 
A native of Donaldsville, Louisiana, Chief 
Justice Johnson graduated from Spelman Col-
lege in 1964 and became one of the first Afri-
can American women at Louisiana State Uni-
versity Law Center to earn her Juris Doctorate 
Degree in 1969. 
During the 1960’s Chief Justice Johnson 
worked as a community organizer with the Na-
tional Association for the Advancement of Col-
ored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and 
Education Fund and at the U.S. Department of 
Justice’s Civil Rights Division. After graduating 
from law school, Chief Justice Johnson served 
as the Managing Attorney of the New Orleans 
Legal Assistance Corporation (NOLAC). In 
that role she provided legal services to over 
3,000 clients in underprivileged communities. 
In an effort to help improve civil rights for 
underrepresented communities, Chief Justice 
Johnson also worked in federal, state, and ju-
venile courts. In 1981, she joined the New Or-
leans City Attorney’s Office and later became 
a Deputy City Attorney for the City of New Or-
leans. She also served as a supervisor for the 
litigations and appeals involving agencies of 
the City of New Orleans. 
In 1984 Chief Justice Johnson was elected 
as the first woman to serve on the Civil District 
Court of New Orleans. Six years later she was 
easily re-elected and faced no opposition. In 
1994, she was elected by her peers to ascend 
to Chief Judge. Shortly after, she was elected 
to serve on the Louisiana Supreme Court 
where she would ultimately be re-elected in 
2000 and 2010 with no opposition. In 2013, 
she became Chief Justice of Louisiana’s high-
est court. 
Not only has Chief Justice Johnson been in-
strumental on the Court, she has also been a 
pillar of her community. She has served in 
several leadership roles including as an Exec-
utive Committee Member of the National 
Alumnae Association of Spelman College, as 
the Chair of the New Orleans Chapter of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, 
and as a Member of the Board of Directors of 
the Young Women Christian Association, 
amongst others. 
Chief Justice Johnson is also the recipient 
of numerous awards including the 2020 Na-
tional Association of Women Judges Lady 
Justice Award, the National Bar Association 
Judicial Council’s 2019 William H. Hastie 
Award, the National Bar Association’s 2019 
Gertrude E. Rush Award, and Louisiana State 
University’s 2013 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King 
Unsung Hero Award. Additionally, she was in-
ducted into the National Bar Association and 
Louisiana State University Law Center Halls of 
Fame. 
Chief Justice Johnson is a treasure to the 
city of New Orleans and the state of Lou-
isiana. As the first African American Chief Jus-
tice of the Louisiana Supreme Court, Chief 
Justice Johnson is a trailblazer whose judicial 
career and dedication to public service is 
unrivaled. I am grateful for her service in the 
fight for justice and equality. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate Chief Justice 
Bernette Joshua Johnson on her retirement 
from the Louisiana Supreme Court.

friends with the food support they need when 
they need it most. 
The food bank was established in Pitts-
burgh’s Hill District at a time of painful change 
for our region, when the unemployment rate 
rose to almost 20 percent and the need for 
food assistance surged. Over the years, the 
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank has 
expanded to the point where today it works 
with hundreds of partner agencies in an 11- 
county area distributing millions of pounds of 
food to those who need it. 
The organization’s work has never been 
more important than in 2020, as COVID–19 
has spread rapidly across the country, dev-
astating our economy and leaving tens of mil-
lions of hard-working Americans unemployed. 
As a result, many Americans who had been 
living paycheck to paycheck before the pan-
demic were suddenly unable to afford their 
next meal. According to the Food Bank, food 
insecurity in Southwestern Pennsylvania in-
creased 42 percent this year, including a 57 
percent increase in childhood hunger. The 
Food Bank’s response has been nothing short 
of lifesaving—having distributed more than 30 
million pounds of food since March. 
I want to commend the exemplary work that 
the food bank has done this year, and I can 
say unequivocally that many in our community 
would not be able to get through these hard 
times without the remarkable contribution it’s 
made to the region. 
My staff and I have worked closely with the 
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank 
over many years to support and improve fed-
eral anti-hunger programs. I participated in 
food distribution events recently where I met 
many community members whose lives were 
markedly improved by this organization’s im-
pressive work. The Greater Pittsburgh Com-
munity Food Bank has been recognized a 
number of times over the years for its out-
standing work, including by America’s Second 
Harvest, Charity Navigator, the Pennsylvania 
Association of Nonprofit Organizations, and 
the Congressional Hunger Center. 
I want to commend and congratulate the 
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank on 
its 40th anniversary of outstanding service to 
our community. I thank its staff, affiliates, and 
volunteers for their tremendous service to the 
people of Pittsburgh and look forward to con-
tinuing to work with them to fight hunger in 
Southwestern Pennsylvania.

IN RECOGNITION OF PAT MCGRAIL 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Pat McGrail as he con-
cludes over twenty years of public service, re-
tiring as the longest-serving Mayor in the his-
tory of Keller, Texas. 
Mayor McGrail’s tenure prioritized a broad 
spectrum of accomplishments to build commu-
nity and enhance Keller’s overall quality of life. 
Mr. McGrail’s Public Safety initiatives helped 
Keller earn national accreditation and honors, 
including consistent recognition as one of the 
safest communities in the country. These ef-
forts included expansion of the Police station 
and the outdoor warning system, as well as 
construction of the new Fire Station 1 and ren-
ovations to the existing fire stations. His lead-
ership helped secure approval of the Town’s 
first Crime Control & Prevention District, and 
arrange regional partnerships with neighboring 
cities, including 911 dispatch, jail, municipal 
court and animal control services that served 
to meet community needs in a creative and 
cost-savings manner. 
Mr. McGrail’s service reached beyond Pub-
lic Safety to build and improve a number of 
other important municipal facilities and public 
assets. Early in his public life, he celebrated 
the opening of Keller’s Town Hall as Council-
man McGrail, the first of many facilities he 
would help deliver first-hand. Keller’s Munic-
ipal Service Center and Public Library were 
two additional high-profile investments made 
during his service to the community, He was 
also among the critical Town leadership estab-
lishing The Keller Pointe fitness and aquatics 
center and realizing the new Keller Senior Ac-
tivities Center with its recent groundbreaking. 
Additionally, several parks and trails have 
opened or been improved, such as Bear 
Creek Park, preserving the natural beauty of 
the area and adding to current and future rec-
reational opportunities for local citizens. 
Mayor McGrail has led the town through 
natural and economic challenges, including 
floods, recessions and the current COVID–19 
pandemic. Throughout these immediate lead-
ership tests, he has remained aware of the 
Town’s future needs. A long-standing pro-
ponent of road and utility infrastructure invest-
ment, Mr. McGrail has sought to support the 
needs demanded of the growing North Texas 
communities while protecting public and pri-
vate property from the natural events all well- 
managed Texas communities have learned to 
expect. 
Through his decades of service, Mayor 
McGrail has experienced the celebrations, sat-
isfaction, frustrations, and sharp elbows all in 
public service come to know. His vision, per-
severance and dedication have left a perma-
nent mark, supporting and enhancing the qual-
ity of life to lead Keller to national recognition 
among the Best Small Cities in America. On 
behalf of the 26th Congressional District, I 
wish him, his wife Pauline, and his family 
much joy in his next endeavors. Keller is a 
stronger, better Town because of your service.

IN HONOR OF TODD ALEXANDER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Todd Alexander of 
Fulton County, Pennsylvania for his service to 
Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District on 
the 2020 U.S. Service Academy Nomination 
Committee. 
Nominating exceptional candidates to attend 
our nation’s service academies is one of my 
most important responsibilities in Congress. 
During this process, I rely on members of the 
Service 
Academy 
Nomination 
Committee, 
which is comprised of dedicated volunteers 
who have served our nation with distinction. 
Todd is one of nine academy alumni who 
graciously volunteered their time to meet with 
and evaluate perspective nominees for the 
Class of 2025. As a graduate of the U.S. 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Todd 
knows firsthand the qualities and dedication 
that are critical for succeeding at the acad-
emies. He provided wise counsel and exper-
tise throughout the nominating process, and I 
am grateful for his time and commitment. 
Todd Alexander is an outstanding Penn-
sylvanian and American, as well as an excel-
lent role model for future academy students. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, 
it is my honor to recognize Todd for his serv-
ice to our community and our nation.

IN APPRECIATION OF MILAGROS 
CISNEROS’ 
WORK 
WITH 
THE 
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, today, as 
the Chairman of the Committee on the Judici-
ary, I join with Representative KAREN BASS, 
Chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security, in expressing 
our appreciation for Milagros Cisneros’ work 
with the Committee over the past two years. 
Milagros came to us as a detailee from the 
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, hav-
ing worked for nearly sixteen years as an As-
sistant Federal Public Defender in Phoenix, 
Arizona, representing indigent clients in fed-
eral criminal cases. Prior to starting her career 
as a public defender, Milagros attended Bryn 
Mawr College and the Arizona State University 
College of Law. 
At the conclusion of her detail to the Com-
mittee, she will be resuming her work in the 
Federal Defender’s office in Phoenix, Arizona. 
As counsel to the Committee’s Democrats, 
Milagros provided indispensable analysis and 
advice concerning oversight hearings and a 
wide range of proposed legislation concerning 
various issues, such as criminal justice reform, 
prison reform, reforming our drug laws, com 
batting violence against women, immigration- 
related issues, tribal justice issues, and the 
federal death penalty. Her works was particu-
larly instrumental in obtaining passage of the 
Effective Assistance of Counsel in the Digital 
Era Act, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvest-
ment and Expungement (MORE) Act, and im-
portant provisions in the CARES Act and HE-
ROEs Act to protect incarcerated individuals 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
As the Committee continued its effort to re-
form our criminal justice system, Milagros’ ex-
perience as a federal defender informed our 
legislative and oversight efforts, particularly 
with respect to issues related to the Depart-
ment of Justice’s implementation of the FIRST 
STEP Act. 
We have appreciated and benefited from 
Milagros’ energy, enthusiasm, and insight over 
the past two years, during which she became 
an integral part of our team. We will miss her. 
We thank Milagros for her selfless service to 
the Committee, and we wish her the best as 
she continues her career.

AND 
MARTIN 
LUTHER KING’S OFFICE RENOVA-
TION IN HONOR JOHN LEWIS 
HON. KWANZA HALL 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. HALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak a truth. 
And that truth is quite simple. 
I stand on the shoulders of giants. 
I hail from Atlanta which is the home of the 
King Center, a place dedicated to the memory 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., one of America’s 
greatest citizens. 
We honor him with a federal holiday and a 
memorial on our national mall, just outside this 
great chamber. 
I am also the heir to the seat held by the 
late great John Lewis. Congressman Lewis 
was by Dr. King’s side and Congressman 
Lewis dedicated his life to peaceful non-
violence. 
Congressman Lewis was a beacon in this 
Chamber for the dozens of years that he 
served. It is one of the greatest honors of my 
life to complete the term for which he was last 
elected, can take the baton and bring his serv-
ice across the finish line. 
But I would be remiss if I did not use my op-
portunity to make sure their lessons are 
known for other generations to come. 
That is why it is critical to make sure that 
we preserve the buildings in Metro Atlanta that 
give life to their work. We must establish the 
former headquarters of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, where Dr. King did 
his work, alongside Congressman Lewis, as a 
national historic site. 
If we do this, then we can do our small part 
to ensure that those that follow in our foot-
steps do so mindful of the example of these 
giants of the civil rights movement.

FAREWELL REMARKS 
HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to rise for the last time on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. 
Growing up on a small farm in New Mexico, 
I never imagined that I would walk these hal-
lowed halls and speak from this chamber. 
Of course, I did not get here alone. I stand 
on the shoulders of giants like Dennis Chavez, 
Manual Luja´n, and many others who blazed a 
trail for me and other Hispanic Americans to 
serve our communities proudly in this, the 
People’s House. 
I also owe my public service to heroes a lit-
tle closer to home: my mother Carmen, a re-
tired public-school employee, and my late fa-
ther Ben, a union ironworker who became 
Speaker of the New Mexico House of Rep-
resentatives. 
They taught me that no job is too big or too 
small and that we must be guided by our com-
passion for others. It was their passion for 
serving others that propelled me to seek pub-
lic office. 
Thanks to Mom and Dad. 
I also want to take this opportunity to ex-
press my gratitude to Speaker PELOSI, Major-
ity Leader HOYER, and Whip CLYBURN and 
countless other members for their guidance 
and mentorship during my career in the House 
and during the last two years that I’ve served 
as the Assistant Speaker. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle for their friendship and support. 
And I thank the freshman members who I 
have had the honor of working with mentoring 
during the 116th Congress. During a difficult 
time in our nation’s history, their commitment 
to their constituents and the nation has in-
spired me every day. 
I thank my staff who work long hours and 
weekends to serve the people of New Mexico. 
Their support has enabled me to make 
progress on the issues that matter most to 
New Mexicans. 
And finally, I thank the people of New Mexi-
co’s Third Congressional District. It’s been 
such an honor to represent them in the 
House, and I’ll never stop working to make a 
positive difference. 
I’m proud of what we were able to accom-
plish for New Mexico’s Third District: 
Defending the Affordable Care Act, which 
expanded health coverage to 270,000 New 
Mexicans; 
Reaching across the aisle to pass bills into 
law combating the opioid epidemic that has 
ravaged families and communities; 
Working with my Republican colleagues to 
make robust investments in our world-class 
National Labs; 
Creating good-paying jobs for New Mexi-
cans by passing measures to bolster our 
state’s growing outdoor economy and to im-
prove broadband deployment in our rural com-
munities; 
Passing legislation to preserve and protect 
Native languages for future generations; 
Ensuring New Mexico’s land grants and 
acequias are treated with dignity and respect, 
and can continue to thrive; 
And assisting thousands of New Mexicans 
in navigating our federal agencies—helping 
veterans and seniors secure their hard-earned 
benefits, taxpayers navigate the IRS, and new 
citizens through the naturalization process. 
I include in the RECORD a list of 29 bills that 
I led and 10 that I co-led that became law 
while I’ve served in the House. 
Come January, the Third District will have a 
new 
representative 
in 
Teresa 
Leger 
Fernandez. I know she will be a champion for 
working families, for New Mexico. 
I look forward to continuing to work with her 
and the rest of my friends in the New Mexico 
delegation from the other side of the Capitol. 
I’m truly humbled that the people of New 
Mexico have sent me to be their voice in the 
United States Senate. To be perfectly honest, 
it hasn’t sunk in yet. 
But I’ll miss the People’s House. It’s been 
the privilege of my lifetime to serve here along 
with my colleagues. Let’s continue to heed the 
call of the American people and make a posi-
tive difference every day that we can. 
I’m proud to have led the following bills 
passed into law to improve the lives of New 
Mexicans: 
The Esther Martinez Native American 
Languages Programs Reauthorization Act; 
The Prompt and Fast Action to Stop Dam-
ages Act of 2019;

RECOGNIZING JOHN ‘‘JACK’’ 
BENNETT 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, along with Representatives MARK 
DESAULNIER, ANNA G. ESHOO, RO KHANNA, 
BARBARA LEE, JERRY MCNERNEY, JIMMY PA-
NETTA, and MIKE THOMPSON, I rise to recog-
nize John ‘‘Jack’’ Bennett on the occasion of 
his retirement from the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (FBI) on November 30, 2020. 
Before finding himself with a federal badge, 
Jack was a Special Agent with the Georgia 
Bureau of Investigation. From there, he joined 
the Drug Enforcement Administration before 
landing at the FBI Academy in 1998. From the 
beginning, Jack’s leadership skills were appar-
ent. His academy class awarded him the ‘‘Fi-
delity, Bravery, and Integrity’’ award upon 
graduation. When the World Trade Center was 
attacked on 9/11, Jack was in his first assign-
ment in nearby Newark, New Jersey and 
aided in the investigation. 
Jack’s experience goes well beyond law en-
forcement and into law creation. His legislative 
experience came from serving as the FBI’s 
agent embedded with the National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children. There, he was 
instrumental in drafting child-protection legisla-
tion that would become the Adam Walsh Act. 
Jack’s portfolio and experience continued to 
expand and evolve as he was appointed to 
the FBI Director’s Next Generation Cyber Ini-
tiative, leading to partnerships with the tech 
community and encouraging collaboration the 
public and private sectors. His experience 
there made him a natural fit to run the FBI’s 
Digital Forensics and Analysis Section, where 
he worked with several of our allies around 
the world to embed American forensic profes-
sionals and assist with counterterrorism efforts 
worldwide. 
It was my privilege to work with Jack while 
he served as the Special Agent in Charge of 
the San Francisco Division. While charged 
with running the FBI’s 6th largest field office, 
he also served as the Director of National In-
telligence for the Pacific Region and chaired 
the FBI Director’s Special Agents in Charge 
Advisory Committee. 
As Bay Area Members of Congress, we ap-
preciated Jack’s leadership most when our 
nearby communities suffered great tragedy, 
such as the investigation into the mass shoot-
ing in Gilroy in July 2019. 
I thank Jack for his service. His entire ca-
reer has been dedicated to keeping Americans 
safe, and it is much appreciated. We wish him 
all the best on his well-earned retirement and 
while he spends more time with his wife, Te-
resa, and children, Natalie and Luke.

HONORING 
SUSIE 
MILLER, 
DIS-
TRICT 
DIRECTOR 
FOR 
TEXAS– 
24TH 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I have 
had the high honor of representing the 24th 
Congressional District of Texas since 2005, 
and throughout the past sixteen years, I have 
been most fortunate to have only one District 
Director. My District Director, Susie Miller, has 
been the bedrock of my team, ensuring the 
highest levels of constituent outreach and 
service throughout the district. Her standards 
of service and professionalism are a model to 
others, as is the humble manner with which 
she goes about her work. She is an out-
standing public servant in the truest fashion. 
Susie is the longest tenured staff member of 
the Team Marchant office, as her service 
dates back to when I was serving in the Texas 
House of Representatives. Her experience 
and knowledge of the district is irreplaceable. 
She has led an outstanding district office, one 
where her encouragement drives the staffers 
she supervises to achieve the best outcome 
for our constituents in every situation. 
Her impact was not limited to the district, 
but was felt in Washington, D.C. as well. 
Susie was instrumental in fostering a great 
working relationship between my Washington 
and Texas offices. All too often, I will hear my 
colleagues complain about needless tensions 
between their Washington and district offices. 
That was never the case for me, in large part 
because of Susie and her constant dedication 
to ensure all staffers were on the same page 
and supported each other. Truth be told, the 
Washington office always looked forward to 
the frequent deliveries of Girl Scout cookie 
care packages that Susie would send—of 
course, those cookies didn’t last long. 
I ask all of my colleagues to join me in 
thanking Susie Miller for her many years of 
service and to also express our gratitude to 
the entire Miller family, her husband Doug and 
their sons Doug, Jr. and Rick. They have been 
most supportive of Susie with her work at odd 
hours of the day and on weekends. Like many 
of our staffers, Susie’s work was not limited by 
the nine-to-five schedule, often requiring work 
on the weekends or after hours. I know that 
Susie will miss much about the job when she 
retires from being a Congressional staffer at 
the end of this Congress, but perhaps the late 
evening and weekend emergency phone calls 
will not be missed too much. I thank Susie for 
all of her hard work, I could not have done my 
job without her.

WILLIAM EPPES PROCTOR 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 17, 2020 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of William Eppes Proctor, who 
sadly passed away on December 6, 2020. 
William was a Tallahassee native and a 
Senior at Florida State University pursuing a 
degree in Risk Management and Insurance. 
William 
was 
loved 
by 
everyone 
he 
interacted with and made certain that he left a 
positive mark on each community he touched. 
William found his second family with the 
brothers of Sigma Phi Epsilon, where he ex-
celled in one of the fraternity’s main staples— 
virtue. 
William’s high moral standards and prin-
ciples enabled him to serve in many different 
departments of his university—including his 
fraternity, the Florida State Student Founda-
tion, and Garnet & Gold Key. 
William will continue to serve as an inspira-
tion and a light to all. 
My thoughts, prayers, and condolences are 
with William’s mother, Lesley; his father, Rob-
ert; his sister, Grace; and his friends. 
Though not here with us physically, his 
laughter, heart, spirit, and memory will live on 
forever—may he rest in peace.
