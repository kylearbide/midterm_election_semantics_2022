REST IN PEACE, JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, in 
‘‘The Columbian Orator,’’ a collection 
of speeches that Frederick Douglass 
read as a young man, there is a speech 
that says: ‘‘Let it be remembered, 
there is no luxury so exquisite as the 
exercise of humanity, and no post so 
honorable as his, who defends the 
rights of man.’’ 
Now, I don’t know if Douglass read 
those exact words, but I do know a man 
who embodied them better than anyone 
else in my lifetime: John Lewis. John’s 
legacy is his love of country and hu-
manity. He rose above prejudice and re-
sponded to force with forgiveness. 
In his time, there was a lot that he 
couldn’t love about America, but he 
never gave up on it or wanted to de-
stroy it. Instead, he used what is right 
with America to fix what was wrong 
with it. 
Because of his patriotism, our Nation 
has come a long way, not perfect, but 
more perfect, as we must always strive 
to be. 
John was unquestionably one of the 
great champions of freedom in the 
modern age, and he secured his place as 
a giant in American history long before 
his career in Congress even began. 
Born on a farm without running 
water or power, the son of a share-
cropper rose to become a founding 
leader of the civil rights movement by 
the age of 23. As a young student, he 
showed courage and patience and dig-
nity beyond his years. 
From his lunch counter sit-ins, to 
the Freedom Riders, to Bloody Sunday 
in Selma, Alabama, his unflinching ex-
ample of nonviolence was a powerful 
call to arms. It was made irresistible 
by the fact that he, like Dr. King, 
sought to vindicate the core ideas of 
our founding documents by applying 
them to everyone. 
Today, our task is to continue to up-
hold these timeless principles for all 
people. It will not be easy, but I am 
confident we will succeed, because we 
have the memories of leaders like John 
to guide us and inspire us. 
I have several memories of my 
friendship with John that I will always 
treasure. 
I remember my last time speaking 
with him, just 2 weeks before he passed 
away, talking about the latest uprising 
in America. I asked if John would 
spend a moment in time and do a con-
ference call with the freshmen. They 
had not had the opportunity to walk 
through Selma with him to give them 
the example of which he lived. 
You see, my family and I have joined 
John many times in Selma, but the one 
that I will remember the most is on the 
50th anniversary. To think for a mo-
ment that 50 years before, John came 
very close to death, and on that day 50 
years later, he was introducing the 
President of the United States. Not 
only the idea that John would stand for 
all, he always had the patience to tell 
a student about what it was like be-
fore. 
I remember at the State of the Union 
of 2015, there was Amelia Boynton Rob-
inson. You see, she was with John that 
day 50 years prior, and she came here 
in hopes of meeting President Obama. 
She came by my office. And before, we 
stopped by John’s office. 
I told Amelia: Just wait right outside 
the Chambers here, because the Presi-
dent has an escort party, and in that 
escort party, I am one of them, but 
stand there and we will make sure 
when the President comes out, you will 
greet. 
She had a picture of that day, and 
you will see John leading. 
When John would tell you the story 
of the march across the bridge, he 
would walk you up to one certain 
place, then he said: I can tell you no 
more, because I cannot remember. 
You see, they beat him unconscious, 
almost to his death, on that Bloody 
Sunday. 
I remember sitting with TIM SCOTT, 
watching John speak about what hap-
pened that fateful day. I will never for-
get what he said. 
When he would tell the story of the 
march, he would stop at a moment, as 
I said before, and say: I cannot remem-
ber past this point because I had been 
beaten. And I was carried back, and I 
almost died. 
Reflecting on the violence he en-
dured, he said with humility that he

‘‘gave a little blood.’’ In fact, John 
gave so much more than that. He gave 
his country his all, and he was willing 
to give his life to make America a 
more perfect Union, but he never gave 
himself over to anger or allowed him-
self to harbor hatred in his heart for 
those who persecuted him. 
In a true mark of his character, he 
famously forgave George Wallace, say-
ing: ‘‘. . . to do otherwise—to hate 
him—would only perpetuate the evil 
system we sought to destroy.’’ 
John continued: ‘‘Our ability to for-
give serves a higher moral purpose in 
our society. Through genuine repent-
ance and forgiveness, the soul of our 
Nation is redeemed.’’ 
This, he said, was the ‘‘very essence 
of the civil rights movement.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as I reflect on John’s 
life, those words sum up why he was a 
great man and why we will always 
honor him. 
It was truly the privilege of my life 
to call him my friend. We are a better 
country because of him. His legacy of 
change will last as long as America 
does. Everyone should strive to honor 
his incredible life. More importantly, 
we should all strive to learn from it. 
But today, we mourn his loss, cele-
brate his life, and thank Almighty God 
for sending a great man who helped 
change a nation and serves as the high-
est example of courage, compassion, 
and moral character.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE 
JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of our colleague, my 
friend, John Lewis. 
Everything John Lewis did was in 
the service of justice—a courageous, 
compassionate man who gave every-
thing, including his blood and his body, 
to the civil rights movement. 
From the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
Selma to the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, John was never afraid to 
put it on the line, everything, for what 
he believed in. 
John was many things: a fighter, a 
leader, one of the ‘‘Big Six,’’ an HBCU 
graduate, a ‘‘good trouble’’ maker. 
He was honored with the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom and over 50 honorary 
degrees, from Portland State Univer-
sity in Oregon to Bates College in 
Maine, and yet he was always humble. 
Many have called him a hero, a living 
legend, but most of us here just knew 
him as John, our colleague, our friend. 
It was an amazing privilege to serve in 
Congress with John Lewis. 
John was not only a leader of the 
civil rights movement, he was a mod-
ern-day 
Founding 
Father. 
Because, 
while the Founding Fathers assured us 
that ‘‘all men are created equal,’’ it 
was the sweat and the blood and the 
sacrifice of people like Congressman 
John Robert Lewis that made that as-
surance true, that made our Nation 
more perfect and made our form of gov-
ernment turn towards justice. 
John Lewis earned the respect of 
men, women, and little children, and 
he made our world and our community 
and our Nation much better than he 
found it. 
My prayers are with his family and 
every seeker of justice who mourns 
him today. 
Thank you, brother Lewis. Thank 
you. 
Rest in peace. 
f 
VALLEY GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT 
AND BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend 
Valley 
Grove 
School 
District 
of 
Venango County, Pennsylvania, for 
truly going above and beyond to con-
nect with their students during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Due to coronavirus, we saw school 
doors close across the country. Many 
parents found themselves in unex-
pected homeschooling situations, and 
the teachers of Valley Grove School 
District rose to the occasion. 
In an effort to connect with students 
during the quarantine, teachers and ad-
ministrators created VGTV, a YouTube 
channel to share video lessons and up-
dates with children and families. 
Videos can range from a music class 
piano lesson to a banana bread tutorial 
from home economics or the early 
childhood education teachers reading 
storybooks. 
Teachers from all grades have gotten 
involved to contribute something to 
VGTV. J.G. Resig, a high school teach-
er, said the project ‘‘started out just as 
a morale boost to stay in contact with 
our students and let them know that 
we still care about them, even though 
we are stuck at home.’’ 
Third grade teacher Julie Plumer has 
used her everyday surroundings to cre-
ate informative videos for her students. 
For example, Ms. Plumer has created a 
variety of videos about baby chickens 
she had been raising to teach students 
about what it takes to raise and to 
care for animals. 
Content varies, but the thing that 
each of these videos has in common are 
the dedicated educators behind the 
camera. 
None of this work would be possible, 
however, without reliable broadband 
connectivity. 
As 
coronavirus 
has 
transitioned most classrooms to dis-
tance 
learning, 
the 
importance 
of 
broadband infrastructure has never 
been more apparent. 
Connectivity is something that many 
of us take for granted. While there is 
broadband available in many areas of 
the United States, more than 21 mil-
lion Americans, including more than 
800,000 Pennsylvanians, lack access. It 
is imperative that we do what we can 
to address this critical digital divide. 
The CARES Act provided $100 million 
for the ReConnect Pilot Program, 
which provides grants for the costs of 
broadband infrastructure development 
and improvement in rural areas. The 
CARES Act also provided $25 million 
for the Distance Learning, Telemedi-
cine, and Broadband program. 
These funds will certainly have an 
impact on distance learning in the age 
of 
coronavirus, 
but 
broadband 
connectivity is crucial regardless. We 
need 
to 
continue 
to 
make 
rural 
broadband and reliable broadband in-
frastructure 
a 
priority 
long 
after 
coronavirus is a thing of the past. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the dedicated 
educators of Valley Grove School Dis-
trict for going the extra mile to sup-
port their students during these ex-
traordinary times. 
They are hometown heroes. 
f 
REMEMBERING REPRESENTATIVE 
JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
with a heavy heart this morning to re-
member our colleague, John Lewis. 
He was a hero to me. He was my 
friend. I am going to miss his smile, his 
soft voice that could quickly become a 
bellow. I will miss his hugs, his eternal 
optimism, and his hope that we would 
heed his advice and ‘‘keep the faith.’’ 
John had a long and special relation-
ship with my family, with my grand-
mother 
in 
particular. 
They 
went 
through a lot together. They survived a 
lot. They witnessed a lot. 
She asked me to read a letter here 
today in his memory. She writes: 
Dear friends, 
Our hearts are heavy, but also grateful for 
the gift of John Lewis, a man who devoted 
his life to making gentle the life of this 
world. 
John’s 
loving 
demeanor 
enveloped 
a 
mighty determination and passion for jus-
tice, equality, and the realization of his 
dream for the ‘‘Beloved Community.’’ 
A young man full of fire and ideals, quali-
ties that he never lost, he was a trusted 
voice to my husband, Robert Kennedy, relied 
upon, first, as a student demonstrator and, 
later, as a campaign aide. 
Activist, lawmaker, champion, he was also 
a teacher and a cherished friend. 
He and Bobby learned from one another. 
They listened, they understood, they acted. 
As a Freedom Rider, John was badly beat-
en at a bus stop in Montgomery, Alabama, in 
1961. From the basement of the First Baptist 
Church where John, Martin Luther King Jr., 
and Ralph Abernathy sought refuge, they 
called Bobby asking for protection from a 
crowd of armed White supremacists sur-
rounding the church. President Kennedy sent 
in the National Guard. 
In Indianapolis, the night we lost Dr. King, 
John influenced Bobby’s decision to ignore 
Mayor Lugar’s plea to cancel a rally, instead 
seeking to comfort and seeking comfort from 
a devastated crowd of Black supporters.

H3697 
July 23, 2020 
As the youngest speaker at the March on 
Washington, his was a clarion call to end ra-
cial segregation and discrimination in the 
United States. Over half a century later, as 
unrest over systemic violence against Black 
Americans gripped our Nation in recent 
weeks, John reinforced what he knew was 
true: 
‘‘You cannot stop the call of history,’’ the 
Congressman said. ‘‘You may use troopers. 
You may use fire hoses and water, but it can-
not be stopped. There cannot be any turning 
back. We have come too far. We have made 
too much progress to stop now and go back.’’ 
John was witness to our Nation’s history; 
he shaped it and his legacy will forever be 
part of that history. When I think of John 
and Bobby, I am reminded of Stephen Spend-
er’s poem, ‘‘The Truly Great.’’ 
. . . those who in their lives fought for life, 
Who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre. 
Born of the sun, they travelled a short while 
toward the sun, 
And left the vivid air signed with their 
honour. 
Sincerely, 
Ethel Kennedy.

80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
WELLES DECLARATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, in 1939, 
Hitler’s Nazi Germany and Stalin’s 
Communist Soviet Union signed a se-
cret agreement to invade and create 
spheres of influence. The Molotov-Rib-
bentrop agreement allowed Hitler to 
invade the free and sovereign country 
of Poland, while the Soviet Union in-
vaded the free and sovereign countries 
of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
Eighty years ago today the United 
States responded with the Welles Dec-
laration. Let me read it. 
‘‘Department of State, July 23, 1940, 
Statement by the Acting Secretary of 
State, the Honorable Sumner Welles. 
‘‘During these past few days the devi-
ous processes whereunder the political 
independence and territorial integrity 
of the three small Baltic republics, Es-
tonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were to 
be deliberately annihilated by one of 
their more powerful neighbors, have 
been rapidly drawing to their conclu-
sion. 
‘‘From the day when the people of 
these republics first gained their inde-
pendent and democratic form of gov-
ernment the people of the United 
States have watched their admirable 
progress and self-government with deep 
and sympathetic interest. 
‘‘The policy of this Government is 
universally known. The people of the 
United States are opposed to predatory 
activities no matter whether they are 
carried on by the use of force or by the 
threat of force. They are likewise op-
posed to any form of intervention on 
the part of one state, however power-
ful, in the domestic concerns of any 
other sovereign state, however weak. 
‘‘These principles constitute the very 
foundations upon which the existing 
relationship between the 21 sovereign 
republics of the New World rests. 
‘‘The United States will continue to 
stand by these principles, because of 
the conviction of the American people 
that unless the doctrine in which these 
principles are inherent once again gov-
erns the relations between nations, the 
rule of reason, of justice and of law—in 
other words, the basis of modern civili-
zation itself—cannot be preserved.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this declaration here re-
fused to recognize the Soviet annex-
ation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania. This nonrecognition lasted 5 
decades. 
This declaration enabled the Baltic 
States to maintain free, diplomatic 
missions. And with this declaration, 
Executive Order 8484 protected Baltic 
financial assets. 
Today, the United States joins Esto-
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania in remem-
bering this declaration and recommit-
ting ourselves to peace, democracy, 
freedom, and the rule of law. 
Subsequently, their entrance into 
NATO and the European Union assures 
them of being part of the family of 
western democracies. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, walking 
the halls of the United States Capitol 
this week has felt different, like a 
piece of what makes this institution 
great is missing, because he is. It has 
been a somber reminder that this body 
and our country will never be the same 
without our guiding light, our moral 
compass, Congressman John Lewis. 
I have never known someone to be 
more devoted to our Nation than John 
Lewis. He demonstrated that devotion 
by setting standards high and requiring 
her continuous improvement; calling 
out when our policies or practices 
didn’t live up to the words written in 
our Constitution; and never giving up 
on the pursuit of freedom and equality 
for everyone in our country. 
He committed his life to the fight for 
civil rights and, along the way, he per-
suaded a Nation, through steadfast, 
peaceful protests. 
Yes, John Lewis is a hero. He is also 
the closest example I will likely ever 
know of a saint. But more than that, 
he was a friend. 
To those of us who are new to Con-
gress, John Lewis welcomed us. He 
made time for each of us; got to know 
us and, somehow, made you feel like 
the only person in his presence. He 
wanted you to know that he truly 
heard 
your 
words 
and 
that 
they 
mattered. 
Part of what makes this job the 
honor of a lifetime is serving alongside 
giants like Congressman Lewis. Like so 
many in this Chamber, I stood in abso-
lute awe of him. He embodied decency, 
perseverance, 
justice, 
courage, 
and 
compassion, traits that he used to 
great effect in changing hearts and 
minds by meeting hate with love, and 
cruelty with kindness. 
I will forever remember and cherish 
the opportunity to join John Lewis in 
Selma, Alabama, this past March with 
my husband, my mom, and two daugh-
ters. The time he spent with Grace and 
Caroline, describing to them what 
‘‘good trouble’’ was; walking across the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge one last time, 
and reminding us what happened there 
55 years ago. 
He said: ‘‘On this bridge, some of us 
gave a little blood to redeem the soul 
of America. Our country is a better 
country; we are a better people. But we 
have still a distance to travel to go be-
fore we get there.’’ 
Thank you, John, for never giving up, 
for never giving in, for keeping the 
faith, and for always keeping your eyes 
on the prize. 
We know the work we have left to do, 
and you gave us the tools and the cour-
age to continue your legacy. 
Rest in peace, Congressman Lewis.

HIGHLIGHTING CORRECTIONS OF-
FICERS 
AND 
STAFF 
AT 
FCC 
ALLENWOOD 
AND 
USP 
LEWISBURG AS PA–12 COVID–19 
HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the work of the out-
standing corrections officers and staff 
at FCC Allenwood and USP Lewisburg 
during the COVID–19 pandemic and rec-
ognize them as PA–12 COVID–19 heroes. 
Prior to and during the pandemic, 
the corrections officers at these two fa-
cilities, located within Pennsylvania’s 
12th Congressional District, stepped up 
in a big way. 
These dedicated men and women 
went to work every day, overseeing 
Federal inmates, many of whom had 
been moved across State lines to Cen-
tral Pennsylvania. In the face of these 
unprecedented challenges, our correc-
tions officers took on expanded respon-
sibility at great personal risk. 
These corrections officers and staff 
at USP Lewisburg and FCC Lewisburg 
answered the call and they deployed to 
other BOP hotspot facilities to assist 
with diminished staffing capacities due 
to COVID–19. 
Answering the ongoing call to duty, 
USP Lewisburg was asked to step up in 
a big way when storms destroyed por-
tions of FCI Estill in South Carolina, 
requiring nearly 1,000 new inmates to 
be moved from that facility to Central 
Pennsylvania. 
For dealing with unprecedented chal-
lenges under pressing conditions and 
answering the call to duty, it makes 
me proud to recognize the corrections 
officers and staff at FCC Allenwood and 
USP Lewisburg as PA–12 COVID–19 he-
roes.

July 23, 2020 
RECOGNIZING ORRSTOWN BANK AS A PA–12 
COVID–19 HERO 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, for their 
work in facilitating paycheck protec-
tion loans for small businesses across 
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional Dis-
trict, I recognize Orrstown Bank as a 
PA–12 COVID–19 hero. 
Enacted as part of the CARES Act, 
and later replenished due to its suc-
cess, the Paycheck Protection Program 
has been a tremendous asset to small 
businesses and their employees across 
the country, and the employees were 
able to stay employed. 
In April, to highlight the success of 
the program, Orrstown Bank’s Execu-
tive Vice President, Luke Bernstein, I 
was welcomed to the White House to 
discuss the bank’s work in processing 
and facilitating loans. 
Asked to facilitate loans with little 
Federal red tape and even less notice in 
order to help our economy survive this 
terrible virus, banks like Orrstown 
have been instrumental in keeping 
America employed and small busi-
nesses operating. I thank them for 
their work and again recognize them as 
a PA–12 COVID–19 hero. 
RECOGNIZING PENN STATE UNIVERSITY AS A PA– 
12 COVID–19 HERO 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, Penn 
State University is undoubtedly a PA– 
12 COVID–19 hero. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, Penn 
State University, one of the world’s 
best research institutions, put their as-
sets to use in a new way. They scoured 
their campuses and schools for per-
sonal protective equipment that might 
be used in research or other academic 
endeavors and found 10,000 pieces of 
PPE they donated to local hospitals to 
aid in the fight against COVID–19. 
Not only that, but Penn State put 
their academic skills to practice by 
partnering with local businesses in the 
State College area to use 3D printing 
to make PPE for smaller healthcare 
providers and nursing homes. 
While President Trump and his ad-
ministration worked to make sure our 
hospitals and healthcare providers had 
what they needed to meet the surge ca-
pacity and combat COVID–19, critical 
community partners like Penn State 
helped to meet the need. 
For their work in providing needed 
PPE supplies, Penn State University is 
recognized as a PA–12 COVID–19 hero. 
RECOGNIZING LEWISTOWN PRINTWORKS AS A PA– 
12 COVID–19 HERO 
Mr. 
KELLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Lewistown Printworks is a central 
Pennsylvania small business that is 
undoubtedly a PA–12 COVID–19 hero. 
Lewistown Printworks is a small 
business in Mifflin County, Pennsyl-
vania, that experienced the struggles of 
operating a small business through the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This small, fam-
ily-owned business saw an opportunity 
to help others. In their ‘‘Support 
Small’’ project, Michelle and Caleb 
Fetter, the owners of this small, fam-
ily-owned business, asked local busi-
nesses for logos that could be printed 
on T-shirts. Those T-shirts were then 
sold as part of an online fundraiser 
with $20 of each sale going to local 
businesses whose logo was on the shirt. 
As of mid-May, the project earned 
$5,300 for local businesses to help them 
weather the COVID–19 pandemic. 
For their ingenuity, resourcefulness, 
and generous spirit, Michelle and Caleb 
Fetter of Lewistown Printworks are 
recognized as being PA–12 COVID–19 
heroes.

HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honor and a joy to acknowledge 
my one-quarter century relationship 
with our friend, John Lewis. The better 
I got to know him, the deeper my re-
spect for his courage, his determina-
tion, and his strength. 
People have remarked about his 
gentle spirit, his kindness, and his gen-
erosity. I watched countless young peo-
ple be introduced to him in awe, in-
cluding my own grandson. 
I just heard Leader MCCARTHY ac-
knowledge being in Selma with John 
on the 50th anniversary of that Bloody 
Sunday. It was beyond my ability for 
words to express watching John. On 
that stage near where he was once al-
most beaten to death, he spoke as a 
Member of Congress and then he intro-
duced the first Black President of the 
United States, Barack Obama. 
It is heartening to hear so many who 
were polar opposites of John politically 
honor and praise his life and his serv-
ice. They sincerely mourn his passing 
and salute his career. I would hope, Mr. 
Speaker, however, that we would not 
just repeat his words, but listen and 
understand and honor his lifework and 
his lifetime commitment to lifting peo-
ple up and helping them find their 
voices and express their wishes by exer-
cising the precious right of voting. 
When John started, the vote was sup-
pressed by violence and intimidation. 
Today people are suppressing the votes 
using computers, legal challenges, and 
capricious voting standards against the 
poor, people of color, the young, and 
the marginalized. These are people 
John knew should have special help, 
but instead he was outraged in his own 
gentle but forceful way that they got 
special barriers shutting them out. 
I would hope that those who come to 
the floor to issue their tributes to John 
Lewis would join me in respecting his 
life’s work. Let’s find ways to work to-
gether to protect the political process 
for those whom he fought so valiantly 
to be able to engage and protect. 
I will be forever grateful for his 
friendship and his example. I hope we 
will all find it in our hearts to honor 
his mission which should be the mis-
sion of us all. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF RON 
RICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the life, 
love, and special friendship of Ron 
Rice. 
He had a heart as big as the Texas 
Panhandle, and he was a friend as 
faithful as the west Texas sunrise. His 
signature contagious laugh can be 
heard from heaven even in this day of 
profound grief. 
But 
Uncle 
Ronnie, 
Joy, 
Tracey, 
Darren, and Rusty know what the 
Scripture tells us and what God prom-
ises: that to be absent from the body as 
a child of God is to be present with the 
Lord. So on this day, Mr. Speaker, we 
don’t grieve as the world grieves. As 
the Scripture says, we should be pitied 
among all men if our hope is in this 
fallen world. No, sir. We rally around 
the Rice family today. We join them in 
thanking God and worshiping and 
praising God because Ron is home with 
his Lord and Savior, Jesus, in eternal 
happiness, joy unspeakable, and peace 
everlasting. 
God bless the Rice family. 
Guns up, Ron. You got the best seat 
in the House. 
REDUCING NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, Ad-
miral Mullen was asked at a hearing 
what he thought the greatest threat to 
national security was. His response was 
powerful, simple, and very clear. He 
said the greatest threat to our national 
security is our national debt. I would 
add that it is not just a threat to our 
security, but it is a threat to our pros-
perity; it is a threat to the blessings of 
liberty and opportunity for our chil-
dren; and it is a threat to domestic 
tranquility. 
There is not a greater threat that 
looms larger on the horizon. There is 
not a greater challenge in this 21st cen-
tury and for my generation than the 
potential and the prospects of a sov-
ereign debt crisis. 
We have no doubt experienced an un-
precedented public health and eco-
nomic disaster as a result of the pan-
demic. But if we don’t commit to re-
ducing our national debt, we will in-
deed face a crisis far graver than what 
could come out of this pandemic. 
We have experienced the largest gen-
erational retirement in history, run-
away healthcare costs, and record 
spending. Discretionary, nondefense, 
and defense spending all have amassed 
a whopping $1 trillion in debt. This is 
pre-COVID. That is $1 trillion in an-
nual deficit spending, spending $1 tril-
lion more on our Nation’s priorities 
and our budget over what we have to 
spend. 
We have done that year in and year 
out, to the tune now of a $23-trillion 
debt and climbing. This is pre-COVID, I 
want to remind you, Mr. Speaker. 
Prior to COVID and the trillions of 
dollars that we are spending, we were

on course to spend more to service our 
debt to bondholders like China than all 
of our national defense combined in 
less than 10 years. 
Now, the CBO has projected that we 
will add almost $4 trillion to our na-
tional debt by the end of this fiscal 
year. As a result, we put ourselves in a 
very, very tenuous position. We will ex-
ceed, Mr. Speaker, our debt per the size 
of our economy as it was in World War 
II, which was the largest debt position 
we ever held. We will set a very dan-
gerous precedent for the next genera-
tion. We will put them in a very, very 
bad position. 
So, SCOTT PETERS and I got 30 Demo-
crats and 30 Republicans, and we 
picked a few budget reforms that would 
put us in a place and force Congress to 
reduce our debt and hand this country 
in a better fiscal position to our chil-
dren. 
We sent a letter with these three ini-
tiatives and reforms to our leadership. 
We are imploring all of our colleagues 
and 
leadership 
from 
both 
Houses: 
Please seize this opportunity to include 
these budget process reforms so that, 
when we get through this crisis, we 
won’t have to endure the ultimate cri-
sis. 
We will not, Mr. Speaker, be able to 
bail out of that, print money, or bor-
row enough. It will be a disaster of epic 
proportions, so I implore my colleagues 
to please support budget process re-
forms in this next COVID legislation.

CALLING ON SENATE 
REPUBLICANS TO FUND SCHOOLS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the public schools in 
Macomb and Oakland Counties. 
In between votes earlier this week, I 
hosted a Zoom call with the super-
intendents in my district. I was struck 
by how much they figured out in such 
a short time about operating a school 
during a pandemic. 
Educators are nimble and creative. 
They are used to doing a lot with a lit-
tle. The PPE, the cleaning, the social 
distancing, the technology needs, and 
the social and emotional health, they 
are up for figuring it all out on top of 
already having one of the hardest jobs 
there is. 
The problem is, they don’t have a 
fraction of the resources they need to 
put their plans into place. While they 
have spent their summer days and 
probably fitful nights determining how 
to keep their students, educators, and 
other school professionals safe, this ad-
ministration has offered no plan other 
than: Reopen or else. 
As a father of four, as a lifetime ad-
vocate 
for 
and 
product 
of 
public 
schools, as a union organizer with 
worker safety top of mind, and as a 
human being with compassion and 
common sense, I am calling on the Sen-
ate to offer a real plan in this next re-
lief package, one that acknowledges 
that we must contain this pandemic 
and provide schools with the resources 
they need to reopen safely. 
It has been nearly 10 weeks since the 
House passed the HEROES Act to put 
us on a path required to reengage our 
schools and the economy as a whole 
safely. 
Mr. Speaker, 59,679 Americans have 
perished from COVID–19 since May 15 
when the House passed the HEROES 
Act, yet here we are, still trying to 
push public health common sense up-
hill in the face of denial, politicization, 
and the most disastrous vacuum of 
leadership in modern times. 
The HEROES Act directs more than 
$100 billion in emergency education 
funding to cover unexpected costs and 
$75 billion for COVID–19 testing and 
contact tracing, including key provi-
sions of the coronavirus containment 
corps legislation I wrote with Senator 
ELIZABETH WARREN. 
What has happened in the inter-
vening 10 weeks with their 60,000 
deaths? The need has not only grown; 
it has doubled. Just this week, national 
health organizations and child advo-
cates, led by the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, wrote to House and Senate 
leadership, calling on Congress to pass 
at least $200 billion in K–12 education 
funding. Meanwhile, Senate Repub-
licans have met this growing need with 
the inaction we have come to expect: 
ignoring this proposal. 
What is even more dangerous, Trump 
and DeVos threaten to strip funding 
from public schools, a threat they have 
no authority to fulfill unless they put 
students in the classroom full-time 
even as daily cases are higher than 
they were when schools went online in 
the first place during the spring. 
Nowhere is this more dangerous than 
in our communities of color, where 
schools are disproportionately under-
funded even in normal times. These are 
some of the same communities that 
have been the hardest hit by the 
coronavirus and may need more time 
to reopen safely. If we are at long last 
serious about racial justice, we must 
offer resources and flexibility, not ulti-
matums. 
Senate Republicans can choose to be 
redefined by the vanity projects of a 
President only concerned with pre-
tending this virus is over and a Sec-
retary of Education continuing her 
lifelong 
crusade 
to 
defund 
public 
schools and even spreading outright 
falsehoods, such that children are stop-
pers of COVID–19, or they can do their 
job: represent the educators, school 
professionals, parents, and students in 
their States by doing what is in the 
best interest of the health and safety of 
our citizens. 
NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER 
RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-
TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF 
THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) for 3 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to 
give notice of my intention to raise a 
question of the privileges of the House 
with the form of the resolution to be as 
follows. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. This is not in 
order during morning hour. 
Mr. GOHMERT. My understanding is 
that the rules allow any time a Mem-
ber is properly recognized to speak 
that that privileged resolution then 
takes priority over all other business 
at that point. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
House has not convened for legislative 
business for the day; therefore, the 
gentleman’s motion is not recognized 
for that purpose. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I will 
wait for 1 minutes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman yield back? 
Mr. GOHMERT. Yes.

REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN 
JOHN LEWIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES) for 1 minute. 
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to remember John Lewis, our col-
league, our friend, our inspiration. 
In life, you are blessed if the chance 
comes to cross paths with those his-
tory has anointed to be great dif-
ference-makers in the journey towards 
a more compassionate and just world. I 
will forever be grateful for the last 14 
years. I had the opportunity to serve 
with this extraordinary man, to wit-
ness his commitment to improving the 
lives of every American. 
Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege to 
work closely with John in our efforts 
to clear a path to the ballot box, to in-
sist 
on 
accountability 
and 
trans-
parency in government, and to push 
back on the influence of money and 
special interests in our politics. 
Whatever the issue, whatever the 
struggle, John Lewis’ exhortation to us 
was consistent: ‘‘Keep your eyes on the 
prize.’’ ‘‘Never give up’’ and ‘‘never 
give in.’’ 
We carry his legacy forward—his 
struggle for voting rights, civil rights, 
and human rights, for the voiceless, for 
a democracy that respects the people 
and lifts our Nation. 
His struggle is our struggle, and we 
will keep marching, knowing that he is 
at our side. 
May his memory be eternal.

REMEMBERING JOSE ORNELAS 
(Mr. COX of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
COX 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jose 
Ornelas, who passed away on July 19. 
Jose was a friend and a dedicated pub-
lic servant, serving as a council mem-
ber in San Joaquin, California. 
The son of farmworkers, Mr. Ornelas 
earned many academic degrees and was 
a successful small business owner. 
But his passion was community serv-
ice, public service. Always a fierce ad-
vocate for rural communities, Jose be-
lieved deeply in the attainability of the 
American Dream for all Central Valley 
families. 
He spearheaded the group Nueva Ali- 
anza, an organization composed of 
farmworker families dedicated to fight-
ing for workers’ rights and environ-
mental justice. 
He was also a founding member of 
the influential Central Valley Leader-
ship Roundtable that advocates for ex-
panded opportunity in rural commu-
nities throughout the Valley. 
As a mentor to many young people, 
Jose was a youth soccer coach. He pro-
moted civic engagement and tirelessly 
worked to expand access to clean 
drinking water for our families. 
He is survived by his parents, sib-
lings, his lovely wife, Nadia, and their 
six children: Jose Jr., Gustavo, Angel, 
Oscar, Giselle, and Shayla. He will al-
ways be remembered for his generous 
spirit and always as a steadfast cham-
pion for rural farmworker families. 
f 
SUPPORTING THE PAYCHECK 
PROTECTION FOR PRODUCERS ACT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to share 
my support for H.R. 7175, the Paycheck 
Protection for Producers Act. I was 
pleased to cosponsor this legislation 
with Representatives JOYCE, KIND, and 
BRINDISI. 
The bill is simple. It would expand 
access to the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram for farmers and ranchers, folks 
who are no strangers to economic hard-
ship. 
Many farmers and ranchers, particu-
larly our dairy farmers, have been 
deemed ineligible to receive PPP loans 
due to negative net incomes. With this 
legislation, producers filing a schedule 
F will be allowed to use their gross in-
come rather than their net income 
when calculating their PPP loans. 
We owe these folks a great deal of 
gratitude for working around the clock 
through the COVID–19 pandemic to en-
sure the continuity of the food supply 
chain. The Paycheck Protection for 
Producers Act will allow these pro-
ducers to be on an even footing with 
every other American small business, 
and I urge my colleagues to join us in 
supporting our farmers and our ranch-
ers. 
f 
REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN 
JOHN LEWIS 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, we 
learned from civil rights giant Con-
gressman John Lewis that we have a 
moral obligation, a mission, and a 
mandate to speak up, to speak out, and 
do it in good trouble. 
In honor of your legacy, Congress-
man Lewis, I will continue the path of 
good trouble by demanding that water 
is a human right, by banning racist fa-
cial recognition technology, repealing 
the opportunity zones and spend that 
money on helping end poverty in Black 
communities. I will continue to fight 
to pass your Voting Rights Act. 
You reminded us every single day in 
this Chamber that waiting isn’t always 
the right option. Too many of our resi-
dents don’t have time to wait any 
longer. The oppression is killing them. 
It is an honor to have served with 
you, Congressman. I will never forget 
walking across the Pettus Bridge with 
you and my young son. 
Peace and love. 
f 
REMEMBERING ROSEMARY 
STRATIOTI 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a remarkable 
woman named Rosemary Stratioti, a 
well-known West Duluth native who re-
cently passed away from COVID–19. 
Her life serves as an example of what 
it means to be a friend, a neighbor, and 
a patriot. As a daughter of a World War 
I veteran and a spouse of a World War 
II veteran, Rosemary dedicated her life 
to honoring those who fought and sac-
rificed for our country. 
Rosemary served as the president of 
the West Duluth American Legion aux-
iliary for over 50 years. She helped lead 
and organize the West Duluth Memo-
rial Day parade. 
Rosemary made a special effort to 
ensure the children in her community 
knew the real meaning behind Memo-
rial Day and that it is not just another 
day off from school. She was known to 
say: ‘‘If it wasn’t for the soldiers who 
gave their lives for you and me, we 
wouldn’t be here today.’’ 
She held this patriotic spirit year- 
round, and when vandals knocked down 
a concrete eagle from a military vet-
eran’s monument in Duluth, it was 
Rosemary who led an effort to restore 
the monument honoring veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I know that Rose-
mary Stratioti is already missed by her 
family, friends, and our whole commu-
nity of West Duluth, but I hope they 
are comforted in knowing that she will 
be long remembered for her many con-
tributions. 
Rosemary, rest in peace, faithful 
servant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 23, 2020 
HONORING THE GRAND COLUMBIA 
COUNCIL OF THE BOY SCOUTS 
OF AMERICA 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the Grand Columbia 
Council of the Boy Scouts of America. 
This organization has enriched the 
communities of central Washington 
through its efforts to promote con-
servation, 
outdoor 
recreation, 
and 
youth development. 
Since its founding 95 years ago, vol-
unteers for the Grand Columbia Coun-
cil have sought to teach the values of 
the Scout oath and Scout law to over 
1,000 boys and girls every year, making 
an investment in our youth by sup-
porting leadership, character, career 
development, and healthy habits. 
Every year these volunteers host the 
River Run Regatta, a month of scout-
ing activities that culminates in Scout 
Me In Day, an event that encourages 
the expansion of the Scouts and seeks 
to foster the relationships between our 
lakes, forests, mountains, and the fu-
ture generations who will harbor them. 
Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues 
in supporting the Grand Columbia 
Council and the efforts of the Boy 
Scouts of America throughout the Na-
tion. 
f 
REOPEN THE SCHOOLS 
RESPONSIBLY 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, as 
America 
continues 
to 
battle 
the 
coronavirus, many of us in Congress 
have worked to protect both lives and 
livelihoods. Now, we must focus our ef-
forts on supporting the safe reopening 
of our schools. 
Every child deserves to receive an in- 
person education, if they so choose. 
Schools in Pennsylvania’s Ninth Dis-
trict, 
for 
instance, 
Lake 
Lehman 
Township, are preparing in a smart, in-
novative, and safe manner. 
As the American Academy of Pediat-
rics has said: ‘‘All policy consider-
ations for the coming school year 
should start with a goal of having stu-
dents physically present in school.’’ 
Congress must work with school dis-
tricts to provide support for social 
distancing, PPEs, temperature checks, 
any equipment necessary for those who 
choose to learn remotely, and even per-
haps an on-site health and safety coor-
dinator. We must also pass legislation 
to 
create 
liability 
protection 
for 
schools to reopen without the threat of 
predatory lawsuits. 
Let’s put politics aside, follow the 
science, follow the recommendations of 
AAOP and the President’s task force 
and open schools safely for the millions 
of American families who want their 
children safely back in the classroom 
this fall. 
SUPPORTING THE TRUMP ADMIN-
ISTRATION’S 
DEALINGS 
WITH 
CHINA 
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
WATKINS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I rise in support of President 
Trump and fellow Kansan, Secretary 
Mike Pompeo, in their dealings with 
China. This includes closing the con-
sulate in Houston. 
The CCP has for decades been using 
meticulous multidimensional strate-
gies to degrade and undermine Amer-
ican hegemony and democracies around 
the world. 
Chairman Ghee has accelerated these 
efforts. That is clearly apparent in the 
CCP’s dealings with COVID–19, their 
mass detention of more than a million 
Uighurs, and their violation of Hong 
Kong’s sovereignty. 
Every action that China takes affects 
the global economy and security and, 
more importantly, the lives of Ameri-
cans. 
China’s repeated aggression and ne-
farious actions have proven China can-
not be trusted. 
Thankfully, we now have an Amer-
ican President and a Secretary of State 
who won’t be treating China with kid 
gloves and a President unlike any 
other in history who will be tough on 
China. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE CARR FIRE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, 2 
years ago, on July 23, the Carr fire 
broke out in Shasta County, California, 
near the city of Redding. For over a 
month, the Carr fire burned nearly 
230,000 acres and 1,600 structures. Trag-
ically, it claimed eight lives. 
In the 2 years since this fire, people 
in northern California have proven to 
be resilient in the face of this adver-
sity. 
We continue the recovery process, 
but for those impacted, it is difficult to 
make them whole again. 
The Carr fire, caused by a wheel 
sparking against the asphalt from a 
flat tire, is a sobering reminder that 
fires are preventable. 
So I have introduced the CARR Act, 
which allows us to clear vegetation 
sources of ignition within 150 feet of 
rural roads. 
Better management of our vegetation 
and our forests near power lines and 
roads and elsewhere on our public lands 
would 
prevent 
much 
human-caused 
wildfire. 
As we remember the Carr fire vic-
tims, I will continue to advocate for 
better fire prevention to prevent fur-
ther disasters. 
REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN 
JOHN LEWIS 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, rec-
ognition has properly gone to a great 
man, John Lewis, a colleague who will 
be sorely missed. 
He, along with the great Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., some people say: ‘‘Oh, 
they did much for African Americans.’’ 
But actually, they did a great deal for 
everyone in this country. 
As a young Christian, their efforts 
enabled me to treat brothers and sis-
ters as brothers and sisters. For that, I 
will be ever thankful.

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER 
RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-
TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF 
THE HOUSE 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I 
rise to give notice of my intention to 
raise a question of the privileges of the 
House. 
The form of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
Raising a question of the privileges 
of the House: 
Whereas, on July 22, 2020, House Res-
olution 7573 was brought to the House 
floor for a vote with the purpose of 
eliminating four specific statues or 
busts from the United States Capitol, 
along with all others that include indi-
viduals ‘‘who served as an officer or 
voluntarily 
with 
the 
Confederate 
States of America or the military 
forces or government of a State while 
the State was in rebellion against the 
United States,’’ yet failed to address 
the most ever-present historical stigma 
of the United States Capitol; that is, 
the source that so fervently supported, 
condoned, and fought for slavery was 
left untouched, without whom, the evil 
of slavery could never have continued 
as it did, to such extreme that it is 
necessary to address it here in order 
for the U.S. House of Representatives 
to avoid degradation of historical fact 
and blatant hypocrisy for generations 
to come. 
b 1015 
Whereas, the Democratic Party Plat-
form of 1840, 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 
states: ‘‘That Congress has no power 
under the Constitution to interfere 
with or control the domestic institu-
tions of the several States, and that 
such States are the sole and proper 
judges of everything appertaining to 
their own affairs, not prohibited by the 
Constitution; that all efforts of the 
abolitionists, or others, made to induce 
Congress to interfere with questions of 
slavery . . . are calculated to lead to 
the most alarming and dangerous con-
sequences; and that all such efforts 
have an inevitable tendency to dimin-
ish the happiness of the people and en-
danger the stability and permanency of

the Union, and ought not to be coun-
tenanced by any friend of our political 
institutions.’’ 
Again, from the Democratic Party 
Platform of those years. 
Whereas, the Democrat Party Plat-
form of 1856 further declares that new 
States to the Union should be admitted 
‘‘with or without domestic slavery, as 
the State may elect.’’ 
Whereas, the Democratic Party Plat-
form of 1856 also resolves that ‘‘we rec-
ognize the right of the people of all the 
territories . . . to form a Constitution, 
with or without domestic slavery.’’ 
Whereas, the Fugitive Slave Law of 
1850 penalized officials who did not ar-
rest an alleged runaway slave and 
made them liable for a fine of $1,000, 
which is about $28,000 in present-day 
value. Law enforcement officials every-
where were required to arrest people 
suspected of being a runaway slave on 
as little as a claimant’s sworn testi-
mony of ownership. The Democratic 
Party Platform of 1860 directly, in 
seeking to uphold to Fugitive Slave 
Act, states that ‘‘the enactments of the 
State legislatures to defeat the faithful 
execution of the Fugitive Slave Law 
are hostile in character, subversive of 
the Constitution, and revolutionary in 
their effect.’’ 
The 
Democratic 
Party 
Platform 
again. 
Whereas, the 14th Amendment, giv-
ing full citizenship to freed slaves, 
passed in 1868 with 94 percent Repub-
lican support, 0 percent Democratic 
support in Congress; the 15th Amend-
ment, giving freed slaves the right to 
vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent 
Republican 
support 
and 
0 
percent 
Democratic support in Congress. 
Whereas, Democrats systematically 
suppressed African Americans’ right to 
vote, and by specific example in the 
1902 constitution of the State of Vir-
ginia actually disenfranchised about 90 
percent of the Black men who still 
voted at the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury and nearly half of the White men. 
So they suppressed Republican voters 
as well. 
The number of eligible African-Amer-
ican voters were thereby forcibly re-
duced from about 147,000 in 1901 to 
about 10,000 by 1905; that measure was 
supported almost exclusively by Vir-
ginia Democrats. 
Whereas, Virginia’s 1902 constitution 
was engineered by Carter Glass, the fu-
ture Democratic U.S. Representative, 
Senator, and Secretary of the Treasury 
under Democrat President Woodrow 
Wilson, who proclaimed the goal of the 
constitutional convention as follows: 
This Democrat exclaimed: ‘‘Discrimi-
nation! Why, that is precisely what we 
propose. That, exactly, is what this 
Convention was elected for—to dis-
criminate to the very extremity of per-
missible action under the limits of the 
Federal Constitution, with a view to 
the elimination of every,’’ and I won’t 
use his word, but African-American 
‘‘voter who can be gotten rid of le-
gally,’’ which was said by a Democrat 
and applauded by his fellow Democrats. 
Whereas, in 1912, Democratic Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson’s administration 
began a racial segregation policy for 
U.S. Government employees, and by 
1914, the Wilson administration’s civil 
service instituted the requirement that 
a photograph be submitted with each 
employment application. 
Whereas, the 1924 Democratic Na-
tional Convention convened in New 
York City at Madison Square Garden; 
the convention commonly was known 
as the ‘‘Klan-Bake’’ due to the over-
whelming influence of the Ku Klux 
Klan in the Democratic Party. 
Whereas, in 1964, the Democratic 
Party led a 75-calendar-day filibuster 
against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
Whereas, leading the Democrats in 
their opposition to civil rights for Afri-
can Americans was a member of the 
Democratic 
Party, 
Senator 
Robert 
Byrd from West Virginia, who was a 
known recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. 
Whereas, Democrats enacted and en-
forced Jim Crow laws and civil codes 
that forced segregation and restricted 
freedoms of Black Americans in the 
United States. 
Whereas, on June 18, 2020, House 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI ordered the re-
moval from the Capitol portraits of 
four previous Speakers of the House 
who served in the Confederacy, saying 
this these portraits ‘‘set back our Na-
tion’s work to confront and combat 
bigotry’’; the men depicted in the por-
traits were Democrat Robert M.T. Hun-
ter, Democrat Howell Cobb, Democrat 
James L. Orr, and Democrat Charles F. 
Crisp. 
Resolved, 
One, that the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives shall remove any item 
that names, symbolizes, or mentions 
any political organization or party 
that has ever held a public position 
that supported slavery or the Confed-
eracy, from any area within the House 
wing of the Capitol or any House office 
building, and shall donate such item or 
symbol to the Library of Congress. 
Two, that any political organization 
or party that has ever held a public po-
sition that supported slavery or the 
Confederacy shall either change its 
name or be barred from participation 
in the House of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
rule IX, a resolution offered from the 
floor by a Member other than the ma-
jority leader or the minority leader as 
a question of the privileges of the 
House has immediate precedence only 
at a time designated by the Chair with-
in 2 legislative days after the resolu-
tion is properly noticed. 
Pending that designation, the form of 
the resolution noticed by the gen-
tleman from Texas will appear in the 
RECORD at this point. 
The Chair will not at this point de-
termine whether the resolution con-
stitutes a question of privilege. That 
determination will be made at the time 
designated for consideration of the res-
olution. 
STOP THE CANCEL CULTURE 
TRAIN 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, the cancel culture train, a/k/a/ H.R. 
7573 that passed yesterday, was wrong 
on a deep level. 
I am not going to get on that cancel 
culture train that says we have to do 
away with any mention or remem-
brance of everybody or everything that 
we don’t agree with; or that might 
have said something that we don’t like, 
didn’t like; or that might have stood 
for something that we don’t stand for, 
didn’t stand for. 
The First Amendment was put in the 
Constitution to prevent exactly this. I 
am not going to get on the cancel cul-
ture train because the next thing you 
know, I will get thrown off for saying 
something that somebody didn’t like or 
didn’t agree with or, Lord forbid, that 
I would do something that somebody 
didn’t like or didn’t agree with. 
Madam Speaker, if we are going to do 
this, what happened yesterday, then 
the building names, street names, 
plaques, 
and 
all 
remembrances 
of 
Democrats that Judge Gohmert just 
read about need to be removed from 
every street, every building, anything 
that honors them. 
Madam Speaker, that is a dangerous 
slope to be on, the cancel culture train. 
People better sit up and take notice. 
f 
QUESTION OF PERSONAL 
PRIVILEGE 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I seek recognition for a ques-
tion of personal privilege. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has been made aware of a valid 
basis for the gentlewoman’s point of 
personal privilege. 
The gentlewoman from New York is 
recognized for 1 hour. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would also like to thank 
many of my colleagues for the oppor-
tunity to not only speak today but for 
the many Members from both sides of 
the aisle who have reached out to me 
in support following an incident earlier 
this week. 
About 2 days ago, I was walking up 
the steps of the Capitol when Rep-
resentative YOHO
suddenly turned a 
corner, and he was accompanied by 
Representative ROGER WILLIAMS, and 
accosted me on the steps right here in 
front of our Nation’s Capitol. 
I was minding my own business, 
walking up the steps, and Representa-
tive YOHO put his finger in my face. He 
called me disgusting; he called me 
crazy; he called me out of my mind; 
and he called me dangerous. 
And then he took a few more steps, 
and after I had recognized his com-
ments as rude, he walked away, and 
said: I’m rude? You are calling me 
rude?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3703 
July 23, 2020 
I took a few steps ahead, and I 
walked inside and cast my vote because 
my constituents send me here each and 
every day to fight for them and to 
make sure that they are able to keep a 
roof over their head, that they are able 
to feed their families, and that they 
are able to carry their lives with dig-
nity. 
I walked back out, and there were re-
porters in the front of the Capitol. And 
in front of reporters, Representative 
YOHO
called me, and I quote, ‘‘a 
fucking bitch.’’ 
These are the words that Representa-
tive YOHO levied against a Congress-
woman, a Congresswoman that not 
only represents New York’s 14th Con-
gressional District but every Congress-
woman and every woman in this coun-
try because all of us have had to deal 
with this in some form, some way, 
some shape, at some point in our lives. 
And I want to be clear that Rep-
resentative YOHO’s comments were not 
deeply hurtful or piercing to me be-
cause I have worked a working-class 
job; I have waited tables in res-
taurants; I have ridden the subway; I 
have walked the streets in New York 
City, and this kind of language is not 
new. 
I have encountered words uttered by 
Mr. YOHO and men uttering the same 
words as Mr. YOHO while I was being 
harassed in restaurants. I have tossed 
men out of bars that have used lan-
guage like Mr. YOHO’s, and I have en-
countered this type of harassment 
riding the subway in New York City. 
This is not new, and that is the prob-
lem. 
Mr. YOHO
was not alone. He was 
walking shoulder-to-shoulder with Rep-
resentative ROGER WILLIAMS. 
b 1030 
And that is when we start to see that 
this issue is not about one incident. It 
is cultural. It is a culture of lack of im-
punity, of accepting of violence and 
violent language against women and an 
entire structure of power that supports 
that. 
Because not only have I been spoken 
to 
disrespectfully, 
particularly 
by 
Members of the Republican Party and 
elected officials in the Republican 
Party—not just here, but the President 
of the United States last year told me 
to ‘‘go home’’ to another country, was 
the implication, that I don’t even be-
long in America. The Governor of Flor-
ida, Governor DeSantis, before I even 
was sworn in, called me a ‘‘whatever 
that is.’’ 
Dehumanizing language is not new, 
and what we are seeing is that inci-
dents like these are happening in a pat-
tern. This is a pattern of an attitude 
towards women and dehumanization of 
others. 
So while I was not deeply hurt or of-
fended by little comments that are 
made, when I was reflecting on this, I 
honestly thought that I was just going 
to pack it up and go home. It is just 
another day, right? 
But then, yesterday, Representative 
YOHO decided to come to the floor of 
the House of Representatives and make 
excuses for his behavior, and that I 
could not let go. I could not allow my 
nieces, I could not allow the little girls 
that I go home to, I could not allow 
victims of verbal abuse and worse to 
see that, to see that excuse and to see 
our Congress accept it as legitimate 
and accept it as an apology and to ac-
cept silence as a form of acceptance. I 
could not allow that to stand, which is 
why I am rising today to raise this 
point of personal privilege. 
And I do not need Representative 
YOHO to apologize to me. Clearly, he 
does not want to. Clearly, when given 
the opportunity, he will not. And I will 
not stay up late at night waiting for an 
apology from a man who has no re-
morse over calling women and using 
abusive language towards women. But 
what I do have issue with is using 
women, our wives and daughters, as 
shields and excuses for poor behavior. 
Mr. YOHO mentioned that he has a 
wife and two daughters. I am 2 years 
younger than Mr. YOHO’s youngest 
daughter. I am someone’s daughter, 
too. 
My father, thankfully, is not alive to 
see how Mr. YOHO treated his daughter. 
My mother got to see Mr. YOHO’s dis-
respect on the floor of this House to-
wards me on television. And I am here 
because I have to show my parents that 
I am their daughter and that they did 
not raise me to accept abuse from men. 
Now, what I am here to say is that 
this harm that Mr. YOHO tried to levy 
against me was not just an incident di-
rected at me, but when you do that to 
any woman, what Mr. YOHO did was 
give permission to other men to do 
that to their daughters. 
In using that language in front of the 
press, he gave permission to use that 
language against his wife, his daugh-
ters, women in his community, and I 
am here to stand up to say that is not 
acceptable. 
I do not care what your views are. It 
does not matter how much I disagree 
or how much it incenses me or how 
much I feel that people are dehuman-
izing others, I will not do that myself. 
I will not allow people to change and 
create hatred in our hearts. 
And so what I believe is that having 
a daughter does not make a man de-
cent. Having a wife does not make a de-
cent man. Treating people with dignity 
and respect makes a decent man. And 
when a decent man messes up, as we all 
are bound to do, he tries his best and 
does apologize—not to save face, not to 
win a vote. He apologizes genuinely to 
repair and acknowledge the harm done 
so that we can all move on. 
Lastly, what I want to express to Mr. 
YOHO is gratitude. I want to thank him 
for showing the world that you can be 
a powerful man and accost women. You 
can have daughters and accost women 
without remorse. You can be married 
and accost women. You can take 
photos and project an image to the 
world of being a family man and accost 
women without remorse and with a 
sense of impunity. 
It happens every day in this country. 
It happened here on the steps of our 
Nation’s Capitol. It happens when indi-
viduals who hold the highest office in 
this land admit to hurting women and 
using this language against all of us. 
Once again, I thank my colleagues 
for joining us today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, that was brilliance, 
grace, intelligence, and complete dedi-
cation to what justice, equality, and 
dignity in the United States looks like. 
That is our colleague, ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, and we are so grateful 
to her for her voice. 
What my colleague from Florida did 
was unacceptable. It was violent. It 
was sexist. And I do believe he needs to 
apologize, not because it is going to 
make our colleague, Ms. OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, feel any better, but because he, 
too, needs to learn what unacceptable 
behavior looks like and rise to the 
level of the office that he has been 
elected to. It does not dignify just him, 
but the 750,000 people that he rep-
resents. 
And I thought, Madam Speaker, that 
it would be good to review for my col-
leagues a little bit of the history of the 
word that was used, the word that be-
gins with a b that is five letters and 
that rhymes with ‘‘witch,’’ that word. 
From 1915 to 1930, Madam Speaker, 
that word suddenly took off in usage in 
newspaper reports and articles. And do 
you know why? Because, in 1920, this 
body gave women the right to vote, and 
that was just a little too much power 
for too many men across the country. 
And so all of a sudden, that word rose 
in prominence because, God forbid, 
that women would have the right to 
vote, that we would have power in this 
body, that we would have power any-
where in this country. God forbid, that 
women would actually have a voice to 
speak out on issues that matter and be 
the arbiters of what is fair and right 
and spoken with dignity and truism. 
And so that is when that word started 
to take off. 
Now, I want to be clear that this vio-
lent language is about power. It is 
about power. It is about exerting 
power. It is about wielding power over 
people. It is about fear of people who 
may well be smarter than you, harder 
working than you, and more dedicated 
to achieving justice than you. It just 
may be that. It may be that fear. It is 
about diminishing and disrespecting 
when you have no other tools to do so. 
And it is not new. Madam Speaker, 
you were right here managing time on 
this floor when I, as a new Member of 
Congress, was told by one of my Repub-
lican colleagues that I was a young 
lady, and I didn’t know a damn thing 
about what I was talking about. You

were right here managing the time for 
our side, and you helped me through 
that moment. Thank you. And I did get 
an apology on this floor from my col-
league across the aisle. 
I was also told in Judiciary Com-
mittee to learn how to read by another 
one of my Members across the aisle. 
These are the things that happen to us 
all the time. These are not jokes. They 
are not little things, not because they 
hurt us—we are way too strong for 
that—but because they say something 
about the caliber of person that is here 
in the United States Congress. 
Do you know, Madam Speaker, out of 
the 11,000 people who have ever served 
in the United States Congress, there 
are only 79 of us women of color who 
have ever served in this body. And, yes, 
we bring a new voice. 
And so I say to my colleague, Rep-
resentative OCASIO-CORTEZ, thank you 
for your grace and for your brilliance 
and for your dignity. 
And to everybody who is out there 
watching us and to our colleagues 
across the aisle, let me say this: We are 
not going away. There are going to be 
more of us here. There is going to be 
more power in the hands of women 
across this country. And we are going 
to continue to speak up. We are going 
to continue to say, ‘‘Madam Speaker.’’ 
We are going to continue to have a 
voice for people so that everyday work-
ing people, our daughters and our 
mothers and our wives across the coun-
try, 
understand 
that 
somebody 
is 
standing up for them. 
So, Madam Speaker, I believe Mr. 
YOHO should apologize. I have been on 
a trip with him across the globe. I 
never thought I would hear this kind of 
language from him. I really didn’t. And 
I am stunned, and yet, at the same 
time, it is a pattern, and it is an old 
pattern. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
JAYAPAL
for giving context of how 
these words and this language have al-
ways been levied towards the ascent of 
women and women who are ascending 
in power. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ), another phenomenal lead-
er from my own home State. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
My friends, at times like this, it will 
benefit us all to remember what the 
word 
‘‘Congress’’ 
actually 
means. 
‘‘Congress’’ means a coming together. 
That is the entire point of this institu-
tion. 
People from different regions of the 
country, with varying political views, 
individuals of different backgrounds, 
ethnicities, sexual orientations, and, 
yes, genders come together to solve 
problems on behalf of the American 
people who elect us. 
That is where the word ‘‘Congress’’ 
originates from. A coming together. 
We will frequently disagree heatedly. 
We argue on this floor and in com-
mittee hearings and meetings. We may 
even disagree on the steps of the Cap-
itol. 
However, 
let 
us 
disagree 
agreeably. 
The words being discussed today did 
not live up to those ideals, and the gen-
tleman must say that he is sorry. He 
must apologize. It is not to apologize 
to 
ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
He 
must apologize to his wife, to his 
daughters, to women in this country. 
Today, our political discourse is too 
often infected with an anger and a mal-
ice unbecoming of our democratic tra-
ditions. As elected officials, we are ex-
pected to do better, to act as an exam-
ple of how we can debate passionately 
but treat one another with compassion, 
dignity, and respect. 
It saddens me that the words that we 
are discussing today failed to live up to 
that standard. 
For those reasons, Madam Speaker, I 
stand with my friend from New York in 
condemning the remarks that were 
made. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all of us to do 
better. We must do better. 
b 1045 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would take a moment to 
thank Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ
for 
her precedent and her leadership as 
well. Before I was a young Puerto 
Rican woman upending an incumbent, 
VELA´ ZQUEZ was as well. 
Every single one of us, as women, 
have to stand on the shoulders and the 
efforts made by other women who had 
to fight—fight hatred, fight patriarchy, 
fight hateful men—in order to simply 
exist in bodies like this. 
So, Madam Speaker, I also thank not 
only Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ, but 
Representative LAWRENCE, who is a 
leader in the Women’s Caucus, ensur-
ing that others and other women who 
will walk through these doors not just 
today but in generations to come, con-
tinue to be protected and amplified. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
stand here today in support of women. 
I stand here today condemning the 
words of, unfortunately, a colleague of 
mine. 
I want to reflect on history. 
The first African-American woman 
was elected in 1968, the first Hispanic 
woman in 1989. Madam Speaker, we are 
here to stay. This year is the 100th year 
that women have had the right to vote. 
For far too long, women and people 
of color have been subjected to being 
mistreated, humiliated, and trying des-
perately with words to minimize us. 
Women of color have traditionally 
been excluded from the Halls of Con-
gress, but I am here today saying, in a 
Congress where we have the largest 
number of diversity in women in the 
history of this Congress, our diversity 
is our strength and our unity is our 
power. 
We will see, today, speakers coming 
to this mike. Yes, we are standing up 
because of the words of one Member, 
but I am standing here today after gen-
erations of assault, generations of 
abuse, and I stand here proud, as a sur-
vivor. 
Our constituents expect leadership, 
not schoolyard bullying, from their 
elected colleagues. 
Almost 100 years after the ratifica-
tion of the 19th Amendment to the 
Constitution and now, at a time when 
this body is the most diverse it has 
ever been, this is the time we should be 
celebrating each other, thanking God 
that we have opportunities to serve 
with legends like John Lewis; but, in-
stead, we are trying to roll back the 
clock with behavior that is unaccept-
able. 
I am the little Black girl from the 
east side of Detroit who was raised by 
a woman who is the grandchild of an 
emancipated slave. I am not scared of 
you. I will call you out. I demand re-
spect, and I will respect you. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Michigan (Representative LAWRENCE) 
for her comments. 
As I had indicated earlier, having a 
daughter does not make a decent man, 
having a wife does not make a decent 
man, but treating people with dignity 
and respect makes a decent man. I am 
incredibly thankful to have the honor 
and privilege to serve with decent men 
in this body each and every day. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor and I 
am thankful to serve with Representa-
tive AL GREEN, who is a sterling exam-
ple of such a decent man. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for this 
opportunity, Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam Speaker, I am 72 years old. I 
have no children. But if I had a daugh-
ter, I would name her Alexandria, be-
cause my name is Alexander. 
If I had a daughter, I would want her 
to be bold; I would want her to be cou-
rageous; I would want her to speak 
truth to power; I would want her to be 
just like ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
The name means helper of humankind, 
and that is what she is about the busi-
ness of doing. 
Madam Speaker, I salute Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ for the positions that she has 
taken. 
Madam Speaker, this is not the first 
time we have heard this ‘‘b’’ word used 
by people in positions of authority. A 
higher office in this country has cor-
rupted the discourse. It came from a 
higher office, and we all took it for 
granted. We just assumed, well, that is 
just a person saying something. 
‘‘SOB″: You are talking about the 
mother. This is unacceptable. It is ab-
solutely unacceptable. 
I believe that we must change the 
tide of discourse in the country, and I 
believe that what Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ 
has said is something that all of us 
should take notice of. 
She spoke from her heart, as she usu-
ally does, by the way—a brilliant head 
with a compassionate heart.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3705 
July 23, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I am proud of Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. I will stand with her 
not only today, but in the future. I 
don’t have to agree with everything 
she says to respect her dignity, to re-
spect her humanity. 
And finally this. I grew up in a home 
where scatology was commonplace. I 
don’t think ‘‘scatologist’’ is a word, but 
if such a word existed, there were many 
scatologists in my home. ‘‘Scatology’’ 
is a word. 
I learned early on how that impacts 
the psyche of people. We cannot allow 
what happened to go unnoticed, which 
is why I am here today. 
Madam Speaker, this scatology with 
the ‘‘b’’ word is something that de-
means every woman when it is used. I 
will stand against it, and I will stand 
with 
the 
Honorable 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative GREEN 
for his comments. His words brought 
tears to my eyes. 
I think that the relationship particu-
larly between fathers and daughters is 
a very sacred one, and it is a very spe-
cial one. But I also know, if my father 
were publicly using that language to 
another woman, particularly my age, 
but any woman, I would tell him that 
he needed to apologize and that his be-
havior was reprehensible and embar-
rassing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I want to compliment her on a pro-
found, articulate, and accurate state-
ment of what is wrong with what is 
going on in this country and what is 
going on wrong in this body. 
As one of the co-chairs of the Demo-
cratic Women’s Caucus, I stand here as 
the author of the letter, along with my 
colleagues, calling on Mr. YOHO
to 
apologize, demanding an apology from 
him to Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. He didn’t 
give an apology yesterday, as Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ indicated. 
We really are at a watershed moment 
in this body. We have mourned the loss 
of two great leaders of this body. John 
Lewis, we sat on this floor last night 
for hours on both sides of the aisle 
talking about his greatness. And what 
did he call us? He called us a family. A 
family does not talk to each other as 
Mr. YOHO had talked to Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ. 
We mourn the loss of Congressman 
Elijah Cummings, who said, ‘‘We are 
better than this.’’ 
We are better than this. We are the 
most diverse Congress ever in the his-
tory of this country. Twenty-four per-
cent of us are women; 8 percent of us 
are women of color. 
Now, where does this all come from? 
It comes from the top. It comes from 
the White House, who calls women 
‘‘crazy 
Nancy’’ 
or 
‘‘such 
a 
nasty 
woman’’ or ‘‘a low-IQ person’’ of a col-
league of ours who serves as the chair 
of a committee, a ‘‘crazed, crying 
lowlife.’’ 
Our colleague, Mr. YOHO, conducted 
himself like a hit-and-run driver, and 
he does not want to take responsibility 
for his conduct. I believe he must take 
responsibility for his conduct. 
We are not, as women in this House, 
going anywhere. We are here to stay. 
We belong here, and we will demand re-
spect for Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ and every 
other woman in this House who has 
been demeaned by a colleague, whether 
a Democrat or a Republican. It is not 
right, and we can do better. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN), who is also the 
co-chair of the Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus and another wonderful 
champion for all people. 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Earlier this week, a Member of this 
body attacked another Member over 
their viewpoint, but it wasn’t the ordi-
nary debate over ideology. It turned 
personal 
and 
misogynistic 
all 
too 
quickly. 
What was the egregious offense? She 
said what we all know to be true: that 
poverty is a leading path to crime; that 
if you can’t pay your rent or feed your 
family, you will do whatever you have 
to do to survive, and you could turn to 
crime so you aren’t homeless or so 
your family doesn’t starve. That is 
called survival. 
Thanks to our Nation’s disastrous re-
sponse to COVID–19, more people aren’t 
working, and that will cause poverty— 
pretty simple, honest logic. 
Well, one Member not only took of-
fense to that truism, but they also 
took offense to the person who said it, 
in the most frightening manner. They 
started to attack a person not just for 
their values, but for who they are, with 
the most antiquated view and response 
I have seen in this body. 
By swearing at someone and calling 
them an f-ing b, you don’t denigrate 
the person you are attacking as much 
as you denigrate yourself and, hon-
estly, this institution. 
By not properly apologizing for that 
incident, you further dig yourself into 
a dinosaur-sized misogynistic hole. 
For the Republican Party to not deal 
with that Member swiftly and strongly, 
they show a greater problem with their 
party. 
It is likely not a coincidence that 
half of this body looks more like a 
‘‘Mad Men’’ episode than a representa-
tive governing body for the greatest 
Nation on the planet. 
Madam Speaker, I am so proud to 
serve with ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ 
and every other woman and woman of 
color in this body. This country is not 
just made up of older, White, wealthy 
men alone. We are a rich tapestry of 
genders, races, sexual orientations, 
economic backgrounds, and more. 
We can’t be afraid to look like the 
very country we represent, and smart 
women, 
smart 
women 
of 
color, 
shouldn’t make anybody afraid. They 
should make everyone proud of our Na-
tion and proud that we finally—fi-
nally—are starting to look more like 
it. 
If our actions in this body on issues 
like COVID if done improperly can lead 
to joblessness and poverty and could 
lead to more hunger and homelessness 
and, potentially, crime, if that truth, 
combined with the truth teller who 
looks like the Nation as a whole as op-
posed to this Congress, if that scares 
anyone, well, then they should learn 
how not to be scared or figure out their 
next career, because we have got more 
of this coming: truth telling and rep-
resentative democracy. It couldn’t be 
coming quickly enough. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ for giving me this opportunity 
to speak. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative POCAN 
for his brilliance. 
Madam Speaker, I think the gen-
tleman brings up such an excellent 
point, something we had all seen, that 
what we are seeing here is a resounding 
rejection of abuse and accosting of 
women. 
But why is this only happening from 
one party? 
b 1100 
This should not be a partisan issue. 
Yet, when Mr. YOHO walked down those 
steps and accosted me, and used these 
words, he was next to a Republican col-
league, and that Republican colleague 
did nothing. Not only did that col-
league do nothing, he pretended he 
didn’t even hear it, when he had, in 
fact, jumped in. So not only did a per-
son do it, but a bystander did nothing. 
And I have yet to hear from the lead-
er of the Republican Party personally. 
I have yet to have gotten a call from 
Representative MCCARTHY
addressing 
his Member’s behavior. I have yet to 
see Republican colleagues standing up 
for their daughters and saying that 
this behavior was unacceptable. 
So, in the resounding standing and 
loud calls for justice, equally loud is 
the silence and the pin drop from the 
Republican Party about this type of 
misconduct. 
No matter because, with that, we 
have 
an 
incredible 
champion 
for 
women, for men, for gender noncon-
forming people, and for justice, and I 
am proud to call her my sister. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to condemn in the strongest 
form the vulgar language and blatant 
disrespect a colleague directed at Con-
gresswoman OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
As the Congresswoman stated, we are 
not on the House floor today because of 
just one callous incident. Unfortu-
nately, what brings us to this moment 
are the structural and cultural condi-
tions, and, yes, the very men that have 
normalized 
the 
marginalization 
of 
women and, specifically, women of 
color, since this Nation’s very incep-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3706 
July 23, 2020 
Madam Speaker, patriarchy, is a tool 
of oppression that is very much at 
home in the halls of this powerful in-
stitution; not unlike the hostile work-
ing environments and harassment ex-
perienced by countless women across 
the Nation who dare to speak truth to 
power. 
Today, we rise for every woman that 
has dealt with these dynamics as a 
conflated part of their walk in life; 
every woman that has repressed the 
painful rhetoric inflicted on our bodies 
and our lives. 
So, suffice it to say that these tired 
tactics to debase and marginalize are 
familiar. And, yet, still, we rise. 
Our foremothers, the trailblazing 
women elected to Congress before us, 
equipped us to take on a world that 
was built on contradictions and injus-
tice. Because of them, we have learned 
how to walk with our heads held high; 
our legacy defined by the laws we write 
and the good we do on behalf of those 
we serve. 
I first set foot in this institution at 
the age of 19. My mother poured into 
me a sense of reverence for this institu-
tion, of the awesome power that it 
held. I walked through hallways, and 
still do, flanked by the statues of men 
that enslaved my ancestors, in a build-
ing built by my enslaved ancestors. 
Madam Speaker, while there may 
still be some specters in this hallway 
set on upholding oppression and misog-
yny, I know that when my 12-year old 
daughter walks through these hallways 
today, she sees my name embossed on a 
plaque outside the door and lit up on 
the voting board above this House 
floor. And she sees TLAIB, and OMAR, 
and CHU, and JAYAPAL, and ESCOBAR, 
and TRAHAN, and UNDERWOOD. Our very 
existence is proof that progress has 
been made. 
And yet, although in some instances 
we are better than we used to be, we 
are still not who we can be. And so, 
with my eyes fixed clear on the chal-
lenges of the moment, but clearer still 
on the promise of the future, I speak to 
our daughters, for they are watching 
and carefully taking note of how we re-
spond in this moment. 
So, in this moment, I say to my Cora, 
and all our daughters, you are power-
ful. You are limitless. Your contribu-
tions to this world are brilliant, need-
ed, and uniquely yours. Your ideas are 
substantive. Your lived experiences, 
your kind heart, and your critical eye 
belong at every single table where deci-
sions are being made. 
You deserve a life free from fear and 
filled with dignity and love. You are 
not defined by your productivity or 
your chosen work. 
We affirm these truths to be self-evi-
dent that women are the backbone of 
every family, of our communities, and 
we are nation builders. We believe in 
you fully, without reservation. You 
have a right to show up in the world 
exactly as you are. And who you are is 
always enough. Cora, you belong every-
where. 
And I will close with the words of 
Reverend William Barber who aptly 
points out that we find ourselves, as a 
Nation, in a moment of reckoning, a 
reckoning which calls for reconstruc-
tion. Old fights, but this is a new day. 
Let’s build the world that Cora and 
all girls and women deserve and let us 
begin with this very institution. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
friend and colleague, Representative 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, but most of all, I rise 
in support of basic human decency. 
I condemn remarks that are dis-
respectful and offensive; and recent re-
marks reflected a hostility that should 
alarm my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle. 
It is not expected that everyone in 
this Chamber agrees with each other. 
It is expected, however, that we treat 
each other with dignity and respect. 
There should never be a reason that 
anyone fails to meet this low bar. 
Turning policy disputes into personal 
disputes is dangerous. As leaders, we 
risk inciting violence in others. As 
Congress Members, it indicates a focus 
more on fighting than governing. 
We should never utter comments 
that are misogynistic and hateful to 
any Congress Member. This week, it 
was Congress Member OCASIO-CORTEZ, 
but if we don’t speak out against this, 
tomorrow it could be any Congress 
Member who is a woman or person of 
color; and that is why this must end 
now. 
If any such ugly curse words are ut-
tered, decorum dictates that there 
should be an apology, a real apology, a 
sincere apology, not words that simply 
deflect and blame others. 
On the great seal of the United 
States, it says, ‘‘e pluribus unum;’’ out 
of many, one. Disagreement and dif-
ferent perspectives were baked into 
this country, and it is our ability to 
work with others that we do not al-
ways agree with that has allowed 
America to be the beacon of hope. We 
should never betray these values of 
unity, despite disagreement. 
Congress 
Member 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ deserves respect. Con-
gress Member ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-COR-
TEZ deserves a real apology now. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, once again, I am so thankful 
to all of our colleagues who are coming 
and standing up today, again, not just 
for one incident, but for all of us in 
this country. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding, and I stand here in 
support of her courage. 
I rise to remind every man and 
woman on this floor that we were sent 
to Washington to destroy hostile work 
environments, not build them. 
Few women here, or watching, have 
not felt a man’s bullying breath or 
menacing finger in our face as we were 
told exactly what our place was at 
work. I certainly saw and felt it as a 
20-something lawmaker and had a high-
ly public, similar experience here in 
the Halls of Congress as a 30-something 
Member, once again, from a then-Flor-
ida Member of Congress. That former 
Member was just elected as the Chair 
of the Republican Party of Texas, by 
the way; so bullies continue advancing 
unchecked. 
Today, we take a stand for my col-
league and friend, Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ, 
and all women who endure this archaic 
behavior. Today, we take a stand and 
say enough is enough. 
Sadly, most capitols, including this 
one, endure this archaic behavior, and 
we must stand shoulder to shoulder to 
say that today is the last day that we 
will tolerate it. 
Sadly, most capitols, including this 
one, are still undeniably boys’ clubs, 
but women have critical numbers now, 
my friends, and all of us, women and 
men, have had it with bullies. 
The Halls of Congress are not middle 
school playgrounds. We have serious 
business to do. People across the coun-
try are sick, dying, unemployed, and 
facing eviction; yet, misogyny was this 
Member’s highest priority messaging. 
Unbelievable. I guess really not unbe-
lievable. 
It is a new day, gentlemen, and I use 
that term loosely with some cases. So 
just to reminder for those who still 
want to wield the workplace tool of in-
timidation, your time is up. 
To my sisters on this floor, and lis-
tening at home, to my daughters, lis-
tening at home, we must not let those 
who 
may 
be 
intimidated 
by 
our 
strength scare us away. 
I am proud of and proud to stand by 
my colleague and friend, Congress-
woman 
ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ 
today. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, we can disagree on 
issues that we face as a Nation, and we 
can disagree on the policies and the 
prescriptions that we develop to fix 
them. In fact, this very body was built 
on the belief that productive tension 
and spirited debate would force legisla-
tors to do the hard work of creating 
laws that will benefit all Americans. 
For centuries, the House of Rep-
resentatives has rejected personal at-
tacks like those hurled at Congress-
woman OCASIO-CORTEZ on the steps of 
the U.S. Capitol earlier this week. This 
institution has maintained rules that 
hold us, as Members of Congress, to a 
higher standard because that is what 
the hardworking people we represent 
expect from us, and that is what we 
owe to them. 
Madam Speaker, when we learn of 
the kind of personal attack levied 
against Congresswoman OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, we cannot sit idly by. We cannot

July 23, 2020 
let it go unaddressed, as many of us 
women have long been expected to do. 
We must call it out. We must demand 
accountability, like we are here today. 
That is what we owe to all women, es-
pecially to our daughters. 
We have to send the message loud 
and clear because, apparently, people 
still aren’t getting it. The days of bul-
lying women you disagree with, wheth-
er it is in a boardroom, in a newsroom, 
or a military base, or in these hallowed 
Halls of Congress, are over. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle don’t believe me, watch as we 
continue winning in districts across 
America. Watch as women band to-
gether to say enough to being publicly 
humiliated simply because they dis-
agree. And watch as we make up for 
lost time by course-correcting the be-
haviors that women like us have had to 
endure so that our daughters, and 
yours, will never have to. 
I want to thank my fearless col-
league for the grace, the courage, and 
the intellect that she brings to this 
Chamber every day. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), our majority 
leader, who has stood up for every 
Member in this body, and for decency 
across parties. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, this is 
an issue of who we are as a people. 
Many women have spoken on this floor, 
but this is an issue for fathers. This is 
an issue for sons. This is an issue for 
brothers. 
I have three daughters, two grand-
daughters, 
and 
three great grand-
daughters. They must not be con-
fronted with this kind of attack, and 
that is what it was. 
Some have tried to demonize the gen-
tlewoman from New York who does, in 
fact, bring the intellect, the passion, 
and the focus on issues surprisingly 
that the gentleman mentioned yester-
day in his non-apology. All the men on 
this side of the aisle are supportive of 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ and all of 
her sisters and all of her mothers as 
well. 
b 1115 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from New 
York for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the 116th Congress 
has the largest number of women serv-
ing in this body’s history: 101 women 
serving in the House and 26 women in 
the Senate. This historic class of 
women represents the broad and di-
verse America that we live in. 
We are all public servants. We all 
came here to serve our country and our 
communities. 
I 
frequently 
disagree 
with colleagues, but policy differences 
are no excuse for personal attacks, and 
we know that some of the harshest per-
sonal attacks are often reserved for 
women of color. Furthermore, telling a 
woman, ‘‘I am sorry you heard it that 
way,’’ is a cliche as old as time to be-
little and dismiss women after attack-
ing them. 
We have got to do better. We are role 
models for our children. I am standing 
here not just for my two daughters but 
for my two sons. We have got to do bet-
ter. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first of all, let me just say, I 
rise today to support not only my col-
league, 
Congresswoman 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, but I rise in strong sup-
port of this privileged resolution. 
As an African-American woman, first 
let me just say that I personally have 
experienced a lifetime of insults, rac-
ism, and sexism. And believe you me, 
Madam Speaker, this did not stop after 
being elected to public office. 
It is past time that this body under-
stands that women of color are here to 
stay. Congresswoman AOC is here to 
stay. It is past time that this House 
recognizes that women will not tol-
erate these personal attacks and insist 
that we be treated with the respect due 
to anyone in this House representing 
over 700,000 people. 
The impact of using this language 
against 
any 
woman 
dehumanizes 
women and girls and sends the message 
to other men that women are valued 
less than a human being. 
Now, my mentor, Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm from Brooklyn, New 
York, was the first Black woman elect-
ed to Congress. As a member of the late 
Congressman Ron Dellums’ staff, I 
spent many years on Capitol Hill and 
witnessed the personal attacks and 
curse words against her as a Black fe-
male Member of Congress. 
But do you know what, Madam 
Speaker? Just like the gentlewoman, 
she would not tolerate such behavior, 
and she had to fight, oftentimes alone, 
against such despicable language and 
behavior. 
Well, we are here today with the Con-
gresswoman. We are here supporting 
her right to speak out, to represent her 
constituents, and to be who she is: a 
brave and bold Member of Congress, 
which we know her to be. 
Now, the gentleman from Florida, 
yes, he must apologize to the Congress-
woman. He must apologize, though, to 
all the little girls who aspire to be who 
they are without being called dis-
gusting names and without barriers to 
keep their voices silent. 
Madam Speaker, I close with reading 
you just one verse of our beloved Dr. 
Maya Angelou’s poem, ‘‘Still I Rise.’’ I 
am 
reminded 
of 
the 
gentlewoman 
today. 
You may shoot me with your words, 
You may cut me with your eyes, 
You may kill me with your hatefulness, 
But still, like air, I’ll rise. 
So, yes, the Congresswoman has risen 
once again. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative LEE 
not just for her comments but for her 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR), 
who is another incredible, resilient, 
and passionate leader. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I am 
here not only to defend my friend and 
colleague, ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ; 
I am here on behalf of women around 
the world. This is not just about one 
woman, one incident, or one verbal 
assaulter. This is about respect and 
fundamental equality. 
Like ALEXANDRIA, I was raised by a 
dignified man who told me that I de-
served equality because I was an equal 
human being to my brothers. I am ap-
palled often, like ALEX was, when we 
hear men say: I would never do this be-
cause I have a wife, I have a daughter, 
I have sisters. 
Madam Speaker, you don’t only re-
spect women because they could be 
your mother, they could be your wife, 
and they could be your sister. No. You 
respect women because they are equal 
human beings to you. That is how my 
father raised me, and that is how ALEX-
ANDRIA’s father raised her. 
Nearly every woman in the world has 
experienced verbal abuse, not just 
once, but since they were little girls. 
We experience it on playgrounds; we 
experience it in workplaces; and we ex-
perience it in our social media feeds. 
We see it coming regularly from the 
President of the United States, and 
now we see it coming from his partisan 
lackeys. From birth, little girls are 
sent the message that they don’t mat-
ter. 
In this body, we have seen men who 
are afraid of Muslim women like me 
and RASHIDA
TLAIB
because we say 
proudly that you cannot ban us from 
this country because we pray dif-
ferently than you. They are afraid of 
women everywhere fighting systems of 
repression 
and 
sexual 
harassment 
through the Me Too movement. They 
are afraid not just of us but of losing 
their own power. 
It is no accident that ALEX was ver-
bally abused for speaking up for pov-
erty in her district and its relation to 
unrest because when you push power, 
power pushes back. When we speak for 
people from marginalized communities, 
we understand, as people who come 
from those marginalized communities, 
that is a threat to those who wield 
power against marginalized commu-
nities. 
So, we are here to say that we will 
not allow sexism, misogyny, and patri-
archy to hold us back. We will not 
apologize for advocating for women ev-
erywhere. We will not apologize for 
claiming the power that women de-
served for centuries. And we will send a 
message to our daughters and their 
daughters that they deserve funda-
mental equality. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank so many Members 
who have shown up today in support.

speak, 
Representatives 
CASTRO, 
DELAURO, and BARRAGA´ N
have also 
risen, along with many, many others, 
and I appreciate everyone’s presence. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
CLARK). 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, as we all know, 
sexism isn’t new to Congress, and it is 
not new to America. It happens in 
homes, in schools, and in all places of 
work. 
The behavior, the language, and the 
assault wielded against my colleague 
was disgusting, inappropriate, and en-
demic of the toxic masculinity that 
permeates our culture and our country. 
Slurs like the one used by Represent-
ative YOHO
are meant to degrade, 
objectify, and belittle women. It was 
an attempt to dismiss her, her role in 
this body, and her position altogether. 
All women have experienced this to 
some degree, but so often, it is women 
of color who are singled out. When we 
hear comments like this, men and boys 
think it is appropriate. Women and 
girls expect it. 
Today, we stand with our colleague. 
We will not accept this behavior any-
more. We will not be made to feel less 
than. This is our House, and we are 
claiming our space. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as a proud Member of this body, 
as a woman of color, and as a sister in 
service to my colleague, Congress-
woman 
ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ, 
who was verbally assaulted by a Mem-
ber of this same Chamber. 
Gaslighting my colleague in our 
country won’t work here. I rise to tell 
my sister in service: I believe you. I be-
lieve you not just because reporters 
happened to be standing there to hear 
the sexist attack, but because I believe 
women across our country when they 
tell us of the violence they experience 
at the workplace. 
Violence against women in politics 
specifically is a global problem. I 
know. I would invite any of my col-
leagues across the aisle to answer the 
calls into my office for just 1 day to 
hear the vile sexist remarks made 
about me and other women serving in 
this Chamber. 
When my colleague from Florida 
made the remark in question, he 
echoed and perpetuated those sexist 
and violent calls. 
Madam Speaker, we must condemn in 
the strongest terms possible this kind 
of violent sexism so that women and 
girls across the country know that 
there is no room for it in any work-
place, not in Congress, not anywhere. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

not so designated, or vice versa. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Florida is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, on 
Wednesday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
1060, providing for consideration of 
H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Interior, Environment, Military 
Construction, and Veterans Affairs Ap-
propriations Act, 2021, under a struc-
tured rule. 
The rule makes in order 132 amend-
ments. The rule provides 1 hour of de-
bate, equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and the ranking member of 
the Committee on Appropriations. 
The rule provides that the chair of 
the Committee on Appropriations or 
her designee may offer amendments en 
bloc, which will be debatable for 30 
minutes. 
Finally, the rule provides one motion 
to recommit, with or without instruc-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the bill in this rule. 
This appropriations package provides 
urgent and essential resources not only 
for the American people, but particu-
larly for my fellow Floridians. 
Among its provisions, the State, For-
eign Operations, and Related Programs 
bill provides emergency funding for 
coronavirus 
preparedness, 
response, 
and relief. 
There is much we do not know about 
this virus. The one thing we do know is 
that it respects no border. South Flor-
ida, which is now the epicenter of this 
pandemic, and as the capital of the 
Americas, knows all too well how dis-
eases can spread. This emergency fund-
ing will save lives both at home and 
abroad. 
The SFOPS bill provides robust fund-
ing to advance our global priorities and 
strengthens the international partner-
ships that are critical to supporting 
American influence and effectiveness 
across the globe. This includes specifi-
cally restoring funding for the World 
Health Organization, which this admin-
istration has threatened and is trying 
to cut off.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3709 
July 23, 2020 
Nearly 150,000 Americans have, trag-
ically, died from COVID–19. It is more 
important than ever that we are able 
to share information, best practices, 
and our skill and deep knowledge with 
our international partners. Many of 
those 
international 
partners 
were 
trained at the Centers for Disease Con-
trol over the years, and we simply 
can’t afford to play politics with WHO 
funding. 
Madam Speaker, I led the American 
delegation to WHO for 8 years. I am 
well aware of its limitations and its 
strengths. We need WHO more than 
ever. And, as I said, this virus knows 
no borders. 
Madam Speaker, this bill also sup-
ports the people of Venezuela in their 
fight to restore democracy to their 
country. It includes an amendment I 
filed with Representative MURPHY that 
increases the funding made available 
for programs to promote democracy 
and the rule of law in Venezuela. 
I am also very proud that this legis-
lation provides security assistance to 
our friends and ally Israel, fully fund-
ing our commitment to Israel’s secu-
rity. 
Madam Speaker, also in this package 
is the Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies bill. 
In this country, no one should ever be 
hungry, especially children, as this 
pandemic has made it only harder for 
hardworking families in my district 
and across the country to put food on 
the table. This bill provides robust 
funding for food and nutrition pro-
grams, which have never been more im-
portant. 
The bill provides for more than $25 
billion in mandatory funding for the 
child nutrition programs. This is an in-
crease above the fiscal year 2020 en-
acted level, and the bill provides for $68 
billion in required mandatory spending 
for SNAP. This includes $3 billion for 
the SNAP reserve fund. 
As my friend Marian Wright Edelman 
once said: ‘‘If we don’t stand up for 
children, then we don’t stand for 
much.’’ 
Madam Speaker, also in this package 
is the Interior, Environment, and Re-
lated Agencies bill, which provides 
funding for meaningful action on cli-
mate change and protects our environ-
ment. I am particularly proud of the 
provisions that provide robust funding 
for the Department of the Interior bu-
reaus working together to restore the 
Everglades, 
including 
the 
National 
Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, and the South Geographic Pro-
gram. 
Lastly, among its most important 
provisions, this package upholds our 
commitment to our troops, investing 
in housing, in medical care, in pro-
grams to reduce veteran homelessness. 
Simply put, with this legislation, we 
are fulfilling our obligations to our 
planet, to our American values, to our 
veterans, and to our children. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ms. SHALALA for yielding me the 
customary 30 minutes, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the bill we are de-
bating today, in some ways I am re-
minded of a Clint Eastwood movie. We 
have some good, some bad, and some 
really ugly. But this bill gives consid-
eration for fiscal year 2021 appropria-
tions, as the gentlewoman from Florida 
just outlined: State and Foreign Oper-
ations, Agriculture, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, Interior, Environment, 
Military Construction, and Veterans 
Affairs Administration. 
It is appropriate that we are consid-
ering these bills. The fiscal year ends 
on September 30, and we need to pro-
vide funding for the next fiscal year; 
and without the appropriations bills, 
that doesn’t occur. 
But we never did a budget this year, 
and since we never did a budget, House 
Democratic leadership decided to go 
without a budget. The only budgetary 
reference we can make is to the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019, which did in-
clude spending limits. But, unfortu-
nately, today, many of those limits are 
going to be jettisoned. 
So division A of this bill appropriates 
$65 billion for State and Foreign Oper-
ations, including $8 billion in cap-ex-
empt Overseas Contingency Operations 
funding and $10 billion in emergency 
coronavirus funding. Funding is con-
tinued for important global programs 
to support maternal and child health; 
combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and ma-
laria; contribute to vaccine adminis-
tration; and for the PEPFAR program. 
Funding to the northern triangle 
countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, 
and Honduras is provided to help those 
countries create economic opportuni-
ties for their citizens, reduce violence, 
and strengthen the rule of law. The 
Secretary of State is required to cer-
tify that these countries meet certain 
conditions before 50 percent of that 
funding can be obligated. 
The good news is they have made 
some recent progress, but we are obli-
gated to continue the oversight of tax-
payer-funded foreign assistance to en-
sure that the citizens of the recipient 
countries, the citizens, are benefiting 
and that we are effectively working to 
combat the drivers of illegal immigra-
tion. It is unfair to ask our taxpayers 
to have to subsidize this activity twice. 
However, this division also prohibits 
the use of funds to implement the Mex-
ico City policy, which requires non-
governmental organizations to certify 
that they will not perform or actively 
promote abortion as a condition of re-
ceiving United States funds. It also re-
moves conditions that promote trans-
parency and accountability at inter-
national organizations, including the 
World Health Organization. 
We know that China withheld infor-
mation from the World Health Organi-
zation. We know that that contributed 
to the excesses of the global pandemic, 
under which we now suffer. 
It is disappointing that these par-
tisan provisions were included in this 
bill. We could have had a bipartisan 
bill to provide for the American people. 
The poison pill provisions virtually 
guarantee that that will not be the 
case. 
The Agriculture and Food and Drug 
Administration division appropriates 
nearly $24 billion in discretionary fund-
ing, $487 million over the fiscal year 
2020 level. In the midst of a global pan-
demic, it is critical that our Food and 
Drug Administration be fully funded 
and staffed to stand at the ready to 
process applications for medical coun-
termeasures as they are developed, 
things such as therapeutics and vac-
cines against this novel coronavirus. 
The bill continues to fund the FDA 
Innovation Account. This was part of 
the 21st Century Cures Act and the var-
ious user fee arrangements that have 
proven to be so successful. But, again, 
you have to have concerns about the 
attempts to include authorizing lan-
guage in the appropriations bill, issues 
that authorizing committees have not 
yet debated. 
One of the issues is giving the FDA 
mandatory recall authority. Currently, 
manufacturers typically recall prod-
ucts if the FDA requests that they do 
so, because if they fail to act on a vol-
untary recall, guess what? Big liability 
for them. 
But the FDA also has other tools to 
keep a product off the market. The sec-
tion of code that this appropriations 
bill seeks to amend is specific to con-
trolled substances, which may not be 
an appropriate place to incorporate 
such a policy. 
Future considerations of such poli-
cies should happen within the com-
mittee of jurisdiction, which would be 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood for many 
American families, especially in rural 
communities. This coronavirus pan-
demic has greatly impacted our Na-
tion’s food supply, and this bill works 
to strengthen food security and pro-
mote agricultural research. That is 
good. 
As communities continue to work 
through the ‘‘new normal’’ we are expe-
riencing, with many people working 
from home and remote learning, efforts 
to bolster rural broadband are, indeed, 
critical. 
b 1145 
Once more, rather than simply pro-
viding for the American people, this 
bill includes language that would per-
manently 
prevent 
any 
administra-
tion—Republican or Democrat—from 
making changes to the Supplemental 
Nutritional Assistance Program. This 
policy would result in working age, 
nondisabled adults without children 
not being required to seek employment 
in times of low unemployment in order 
to seek benefits. When we are in the

middle of a national emergency, flexi-
bility is appropriate. However, the ad-
ministration should not be perma-
nently barred from making the pro-
gram more beneficial to both the re-
cipient and the taxpayer. 
Next, division C of this bill includes 
provisions that ensure that our Na-
tion’s environment and public lands 
are preserved for future generations. 
These funds will be used to combat 
invasive 
species, 
mitigate 
harmful 
algae blooms, stop the trafficking of 
endangered animals. They will also 
provide essential resources to maintain 
our Nation’s national park system. 
Unfortunately, the bill threatens the 
advancement of fundamentally pro- 
business and pro-worker policies. It 
adds unnecessary barriers to adminis-
trative efforts to reduce regulation. 
Eliminating bureaucratic red tape will 
be the key to unlocking future eco-
nomic growth, which I would submit is 
still important. 
Division C also threatens the contin-
ued development of America’s energy 
resources, thus its energy independence 
and the thousands of jobs tied to the 
energy sector. Specifically, it prohibits 
Federal funds to be used for oil and gas 
sales on Federal lands and offshore 
leases 
in 
Federal 
waters. 
These 
projects are important to America’s 
economic recovery, they are important 
to America’s national security, and 
they are important to America’s en-
ergy independence. We, in the House, 
should not be limiting the economic 
opportunities in the middle of a global 
recession. 
Division C of this bill contains many 
important provisions, but it is pro-reg-
ulation and anti-energy in ways that 
will harm our economy and thus hurt 
jobs throughout the country. 
I would last like to discuss the Mili-
tary Construction and Veterans Affairs 
division. As a historically bipartisan 
committee, I am grateful for the sup-
port that the committee has provided 
for important veterans’ programs, par-
ticularly in veterans’ health and mili-
tary construction, and for prioritizing 
military family housing. 
We have learned during the past cou-
ple of Congresses about the unaccept-
able condition of private military 
housing that is part of the military 
housing privatization initiative. Some 
reforms were included in last year’s 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
and my hope is that we can continue 
the funding and the oversight nec-
essary to ensure that our Armed Forces 
and their families feel safe in their 
homes on their bases. 
Although I agree with and support 
the veterans’ healthcare programs, I 
am encouraged by the robust mental 
health programs and the opioid abuse 
prevention and treatment assistance 
included in the bill, it is also a time 
when we must be at least cognizant of 
where the Federal Congressional Budg-
et Office estimates are taking us with 
the budget deficit exceeding over $3.7 
trillion for this fiscal year. So I do 
share some of the other Members’ con-
cerns on designating the $12.5 billion as 
emergency funding and disregarding 
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. 
Again, we are functioning without a 
current congressional budget in this 
session of the House. Why do we even 
work on spending caps in the first 
place if we are only going to ultimately 
disregard them for partisan priorities? 
Furthermore, I have serious concerns 
regarding provisions which would re-
strict funds for military construction 
projects, specifically a prohibition on 
funding for any type of border barrier. 
These restrictions unfairly jeopardize 
our military’s safety and well-being. 
We are in the middle of a global pan-
demic. Mexico agreed to limit border 
crossings with the United States. So 
legal and illegal entries have been sig-
nificantly reduced, limiting unexpected 
coronavirus transmission to domestic 
cases. 
Despite 
our 
best 
hopes, 
coronavirus cases are increasing, par-
ticularly along our southern border 
and our southern States. Now is not 
the time to restrict the ability of the 
President to act to further protect the 
country. 
Last, I would like to note report lan-
guage that presents pro-life concerns. 
The language grants flexibility to the 
VA without pro-life protections, thus 
including abortion referrals for those 
referred to outside care resources for 
services not provided by the Depart-
ment. 
Again, this appropriations package 
incorporates 
many 
provisions 
that 
both Democrats and Republicans can 
agree on. But it disregards the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act agreement and in-
cludes poison pill policy provisions 
that, frankly, I will find, and many Re-
publicans will find difficult to support. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues will 
come to the table and negotiate so we 
don’t abandon the American people as 
the end of the fiscal year approaches. 
With that, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I will reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON), the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Homeland Security. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to enter 
into a colloquy with the agriculture 
chair, Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. 
Mr. BISHOP, I have a concern about 
the eligibility of Piney Woods School 
and Farm in Piney Woods, Mississippi, 
which is the only African-American 
boarding school left in America to re-
ceive 
Community 
Facilities 
Grant 
funding. 
Currently, Piney Woods is ineligible 
to receive Community Facilities Grant 
funding because its geographic location 
is considered to be in a suburban area 
in Mississippi, when, in fact, the 
school’s location should be designated 
as rural. The current designation is 
limiting Piney Woods from receiving 
much-needed funding. 
Can we work together to try and find 
a solution? 
I yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), the subcommittee 
chair, for an answer. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate my colleague’s 
longtime interest in institutions such 
as Piney Woods. These institutions 
provide an opportunity to learn and to 
help these students go on to live ex-
traordinary lives. 
As a matter of fact, my father’s roots 
are in Mississippi. And about 60 years 
ago, when I was 13 years old, my par-
ents were strongly considering sending 
me to Piney Woods to complete my 
high school education. Piney Woods 
has a strong reputation. 
I have worked with the gentleman on 
issues like this over the years. I, too, 
share your interest in preserving insti-
tutions like this for future generations. 
Congress has developed programs like 
the Community Facilities program to 
help institutions just like this. I look 
forward to working with my colleague 
to take steps toward making resources 
available to preserve historic institu-
tions and facilities like the Piney 
Woods School in Mississippi. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time. 
I look forward to working with the 
gentleman from Georgia. There is no 
question that Piney Woods Country 
Life School is a model for helping 
shape minds for the future. Their 
record speaks for itself. The kids who 
are fortunate to matriculate there 
come out and actually do very well in 
society. And so it is with this spirit 
that I offer the opportunity for us to 
help Piney Woods be even better. I look 
forward to working on crafting a solu-
tion. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for the oppor-
tunity to express my disappointment, 
once again, with being denied the op-
portunity to amend this harmful piece 
of legislation on the floor. 
The Interior appropriations bill was 
introduced by my colleague from St. 
Paul 
and 
produced 
by 
the 
sub-
committee she chairs. Having anti- 
mining riders attached was no surprise, 
as Twin Cities Democrat politicians 
have leveled attacks at future mining 
projects multiple times this Congress. 
However, section 435 of division C is a 
new low. It directly attacks three ex-
isting iron ore operations: The Minntac 
mine, the Minorca Mine, and the 
Northshore 
mine, 
along 
with 
the 
Coldspring Mesabi Black quarry. Com-
bined, this places more than 2,000 jobs 
in my district on the chopping block. 
These blue-collar jobs support families 
in my district, jobs we need, especially 
during this pandemic. 
Twin Cities anti-job environmental-
ists continue to level bolder and bolder 
attacks on our way of life in northern 
Minnesota by now putting iron mining 
squarely in the crosshairs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3711 
July 23, 2020 
China controls more than half the 
world’s steel market with a cheap, low- 
quality product built with horrific and 
zero 
labor 
standards 
and 
environ-
mental standards. 
In my district, reclaimed mines pro-
vide drinking water for entire commu-
nities. Northern Minnesota has the 
cleanest air and water in the world and 
much cleaner than the brown water in 
St. Paul. 
We all care for our environment, but 
this legislation is no longer about envi-
ronmental protections. This is about 
ideology and our way of life. 
I will fight for northern Minnesota 
and our blue-collar jobs with every 
fiber in my body. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, Congress-
woman SHALALA, for her tremendous 
work and support. Her leadership cer-
tainly is warranted and necessary and 
needed right at this moment in our 
country’s history. 
Let me first take a moment to thank 
Congresswoman NITA
LOWEY
for her 
years of leadership both on the full 
Committee on Appropriations as well 
as the State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs Subcommittee. 
Over the years, the chairwoman has 
been a steadfast and effective advocate 
for a humane and generous American 
role in the world, especially through 
her work to expand education, espe-
cially for girls and women, focused on 
creating many opportunities for mil-
lions of girls around the world. 
I will miss Chairwoman LOWEY, but I 
just want to say that her legacy as our 
chair is going to remain very close to 
all of us, and it will remind us of the 
work which we must continue for fu-
ture generations. 
I serve as the vice chair of our State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams subcommittee and as a member 
of the Agriculture Committee. I rise to 
support this rule, which provides for 
the consideration—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to support this rule. It 
provides for the consideration of appro-
priations bill and contains the emer-
gency funds to respond to the impact of 
COVID around the world and also to 
ensure that our diplomacy and develop-
ment programs can sustain their ef-
forts in the face of this pandemic. 
I am pleased that we provide almost 
$6 billion for PEPFAR, including $1.5 
billion for the Global Fund. We provide 
$55 million for UNFPA, and, yes, we re-
peal the global gag rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, let me just be very quick in 
terms of just laying out why I support 
this rule again. 
We provide $55 million for UNFPA 
and $68 billion for SNAP, which is ex-
tremely important now, with so many 
people needing food security falling 
through the cracks. 
We provide $90 billion for veterans’ 
health and more than a half billion to 
get lead out of drinking water, which 
really, in this country, should be no 
more. It is a shame and a disgrace. 
And as we consider this rule, I urge 
my colleagues to examine the appro-
priations bill through the lens of racial 
justice. These bills contain important 
provisions that respond to this moment 
in American history when people are 
marching in the streets to demand that 
our country dismantle systemic rac-
ism. 
So I ask that we look at these bills 
and understand that equity has got to 
be so much a part of our funding prior-
ities. 
Madam Speaker, I support this rule, 
and I hope we adopt the important 
funding in this package. 
b 1200 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER), a valuable 
member of our Republican House lead-
ership. 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, the 
conversation we are having here today 
does not need to be as divisive and de-
structive to hardworking Minnesotans 
as my Democrat colleagues from Min-
nesota are pushing. 
Today, I stand with the Representa-
tive 
of 
northern 
Minnesota, 
PETE 
STAUBER, who is advocating for those 
Minnesotans who will be directly im-
pacted by this shortsighted effort. We 
both firmly believe that American 
mining is the safest and environ-
mentally 
responsible 
way 
to 
help 
America. 
We have been told, time and time 
again, not this mine, not this location. 
Unfortunately, the reality is, our Dem-
ocrat colleagues want to ban all min-
ing. They want to eliminate good-pay-
ing jobs in construction—labor—and 
allow countries like China and Russia 
to utilize child labor and environ-
mentally disastrous practices to mine 
for the minerals our everyday items 
need, like cellphones and cars. 
This bill doesn’t simply attack the 
future of mining. It impacts existing 
mines in operation today. This bill will 
decimate those jobs. 
I urge all of our colleagues to vote 
against this rule and the bill in order 
to preserve mining in our great State. 
It will also help secure America’s min-
eral independence and give miners the 
opportunity to do what they do best, 
mine responsibly in our country for the 
benefit of all Americans. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maine (Mr. GOLDEN). 
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, the 
purpose of my amendment is to call at-
tention to the shortage of VA mental 
health and substance use disorder fa-
cilities. 
For example, veterans in my home 
State of Maine must travel hundreds of 
miles out of State to access long-term 
treatment facilities. That is just unac-
ceptable. 
A proposed residential unit at the 
Togus VA hospital in Maine would pro-
vide treatment beds to 24 veterans. But 
until VA approves this new construc-
tion project, veterans in Maine have 
few options. 
VA needs to ensure long-term inpa-
tient mental healthcare and substance 
use disorder services are provided as 
close to each veteran’s home as pos-
sible. 
That is why I am proud to have 
worked with you, Madam Chair, to se-
cure $20 million above the budget re-
quest in the MILCON-VA bill for med-
ical facilities. I thank the gentle-
woman for her strong leadership on 
this and also other critically important 
issues for our Nation’s veterans. 
In addition to the extra funding, the 
bill directs VA to prioritize construc-
tion that expands access to overnight 
bed space for veterans seeking mental 
healthcare. 
Moving forward, I ask that the com-
mittee continue to push VA for an-
swers on progress toward boosting in-
patient capacity, prioritizing construc-
tion for these lifesaving services. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
chairwoman. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. GOLDEN 
for his extraordinary military service 
to our country and for his leadership 
on this urgent issue. 
Madam Speaker, no veteran should 
be forced to choose between seeking 
care away from loved ones or forgoing 
treatment altogether. I applaud my 
friend for his tireless advocacy for 
local mental health services for vet-
erans in the VA appropriations bill. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
together to prioritize greater accessi-
bility to these vital mental health 
services to veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I wish the gen-
tleman a happy birthday this Satur-
day. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Maine 
(Mr. GOLDEN). 
Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, I am 
not sure who outed me on the birthday, 
but I appreciate the well wishes. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the sub-
committee chairwoman for her strong 
support on this issue. This is the sec-
ond year in a row that the chairwoman 
and her committee and the committee 
staff have supported an increase like 
this for inpatient facilities for veterans 
who are struggling with mental health

or substance use issues and need treat-
ment, and I appreciate their advocacy 
very much. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR), chairman of the Con-
gressional Western Caucus. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the rule and the under-
lying bill. 
The underlying bill contains a wish 
list of provisions from far-left environ-
mentalists that prevent job creation 
and energy development in rural com-
munities. 
One in particular is the proposed 
buffer zone around the Chaco Canyon 
national park. This provision is an as-
sault on the private property rights of 
hundreds of Navajo allottees who own 
oil and gas rights in the area sur-
rounding the park. 
This buffer expansion in this bill 
would make these assets worthless, 
taking away valuable royalty pay-
ments from these impoverished com-
munities. To put this in perspective, in 
2015 alone, the Federal Indian Minerals 
Office distributed $96 million to 20,835 
allottees around the country. 
Instead of listening to all voices, the 
proponents of this provision have only 
listened to environmental groups who 
claim to represent all the relevant 
stakeholders on this matter but clearly 
do not. Allottees in the Chaco region 
have consistently expressed opposition 
to this proposed withdrawal. 
Any uncertainty amongst the oil and 
gas industry when it comes to the abil-
ity to extract oil and gas from this re-
gion has negative consequences for 
them and the local economy. 
In my role as the ranking member of 
the Natural Resources Subcommittee 
on Energy and Mineral Resources, I 
sent two of my staff to meet with Nav-
ajo allottees in New Mexico. The re-
sponse from these allottees was over-
whelming, as hundreds and hundreds of 
people showed up to express their oppo-
sition to a proposed buffer zone around 
Chaco Canyon national park. 
The facts are, Mr. Speaker, there are 
already laws on the books to protect 
Chaco national park and the pristine 
artifacts that may lay outside of its 
borders. The oil and gas industry has 
both a legal and moral obligation to 
protect the artifacts of the Chaco peo-
ple, as well as avoiding impacts on 
newly discovered artifacts, which has 
always been done. 
This provision is clearly unnecessary, 
and I would urge that it be removed in 
conference if this bill is passed by the 
House. 
It would also be remiss of me not to 
mention the equally egregious provi-
sion in the legislation that prevents 
copper, nickel, and iron mining in 
northern Minnesota. Copper, nickel, 
and iron mining is the historic life-
blood of the economy in northern Min-
nesota and has the potential to create 
thousands of good-paying jobs that can 
be done in an environmentally safe 
way. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON of Indiana). The time of the 
gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Arizona. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, we, as Con-
gress, need to wake up and stop talking 
out of both sides of our mouth. In fact, 
we cannot continue to rely on foreign 
adversaries to take care of our mineral 
needs. We can take care of our own 
needs with our own domestic resources 
in the most environmentally safe way. 
We do it better than anyone in the 
world, and yes, we do it without slave 
child labor like they do in the Congo 
with cobalt as China does. 
Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my 
colleagues to oppose the previous ques-
tion, the rule, and the underlying bill. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM). 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the 
Interior and Environment division of 
this bill makes many critical invest-
ments in protecting our natural re-
sources and contains several provisions 
designated to stop the Trump adminis-
tration from moving forward on disas-
trous environmental policies. 
This bill puts a halt on the use of 
funds in the next fiscal year to review 
approved mine plans within the water-
shed in the Nation’s most visited wil-
derness, the Boundary Waters Canoe 
Area. 
This provision does not—does not— 
impact the operations of current mines 
that already have their plans approved 
and are operating. There is no iron ore 
mine plan under review within the wa-
tershed or anywhere in the Superior 
National Forest. 
Sulfide-ore mines are toxic. They 
produce acid mine drainage, which in-
cludes heavy metals like lead and cad-
mium. This poses a significant risk to 
surface waters and ground waters. 
The Trump administration cannot be 
trusted to conduct an environmental 
review of sulfide-ore mining that could 
devastate this wilderness. They have 
already shown a lack of transparency 
and a willingness not to be guided by 
science. 
Multiple 
Cabinet 
members 
have 
pledged to members of the Appropria-
tions Committee in congressional hear-
ings that they would complete a min-
eral withdrawal study within this very 
watershed. Instead, they abandoned 
this review 20 months into a 24-month 
plan, and they have refused to release 
any of the information. 
Mr. Speaker, I would submit the re-
port that they did finally show me, but 
I have no idea how the good people who 
work at this front desk could put in 60 
pages of redacted material, 60 blank 
pages of a taxpayer-funded report. 
This is a 1-year halt on a mine plan 
in a wilderness area from an adminis-
tration that has shown a total lack of 
transparency and respect for science. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, someday, future generations 
of Americans will look back on us and 
wonder how and why a society that 
prided itself on the commitment to 
human rights precluded virtually all 
protections to the weakest and most 
vulnerable—unborn children. 
I believe they will demand to know 
why dismembering a child with razor- 
sharp knives, pulverizing an infant 
with 
powerful 
suction 
devices, 
or 
chemically poisoning a baby with any 
number of toxic chemicals failed to 
elicit empathy for victim babies. 
The bill before us today reverses sev-
eral modest but important pro-life 
policies, including the Protecting Life 
in Global Health Assistance policy, 
which is a reiteration and expansion of 
President Ronald Reagan’s Mexico City 
policy. Announced by Ronald Reagan 
at the UN conference on population 
growth in Mexico City in 1984, hence, 
its name, the policy was and is de-
signed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer 
money is not funneled to foreign NGOs 
that perform or promote abortion as a 
method of family planning. 
After Reagan announced that policy, 
Mr. Speaker, I offered the first amend-
ment in 1985 to protect that policy, and 
we won. We lost in the Senate, but 
since it was an executive order, the 
policy did survive. And I have done it 
many, many times since. 
The policy established pro-life safe-
guards, benign, humane conditions, on 
the $8.8 billion in annual global health 
assistance. For years, Mr. Speaker, for-
eign NGOs have been empowered by 
taxpayer funds, grant money, to weak-
en, undermine, or reverse pro-life laws 
in other nations, especially in Africa, 
and to destroy the precious lives of un-
born children. 
The Protecting Life in Global Health 
Assistance policy, which was put into 
effect by President Trump, mitigates 
U.S. taxpayer complicity in global 
abortion. U.S. foreign assistance, Mr. 
Speaker, and the foreign entities that 
we fund with billions of dollars of grant 
money should consistently affirm, care 
for, and tangibly assist women and all 
children—all children regardless of age 
or condition of dependency. 
I have authored many laws in this 
body, including the PEPFAR reauthor-
ization, the 5-year reauthorization of 
the President’s emergency plan for 
AIDS relief. 
When Henry Hyde, taking his cue 
from George W. Bush, authored that 
important legislation, I, and many oth-
ers, joined in. We were strong sup-
porters, but Henry Hyde was the lead-
er. 
That legislation has saved the lives 
of some 17 million people with ARVs, 
as well as with prevention strategies. 
And it has made all the difference in 
the world in the area of malaria as well 
as tuberculosis. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe we must in-
crease access to maternal and prenatal 
care and ensure access to safe blood

and better nutrition. We must also ex-
pand essential obstetrical services, in-
cluding skilled birth attendants, while 
improving 
transportation 
to 
emer-
gency care facilities to significantly 
reduce maternal mortality and mor-
bidity, including obstetric fistula. 
The law or the policy on the books 
with regard to obstetric fistula, I of-
fered the bill on that. It passed the 
House. It did not pass the Senate. But 
then I got USAID to adopt it adminis-
tratively. I have been to the Addis 
Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia, 
where many women have gotten their 
lives back because of reparative sur-
gery. 
No one is expendable or a throwaway, 
Mr. Speaker. Birth is merely an event, 
albeit an important one, but only an 
event. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, birth is really just an event. 
Ultrasound has shattered the myth 
that an unborn child is anything but 
human and alive and growing. It really 
is up to us to do all we can to make 
that life as healthy as humanly pos-
sible. 
Victim babies, like their mothers, 
absolutely deserve respect, protection, 
and an abundance of compassion.

Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to sanction any senior 
foreign official who conceals informa-
tion about the outbreak of a pandemic, 
including this current coronavirus pan-
demic. 
We know that China delayed report-
ing 
what 
they 
knew 
about 
this 
coronavirus. They withheld informa-
tion from the World Health Organiza-
tion and attempted to silence doctors, 
silence researchers who had alerted 
local health authorities. 
China’s continued attempts to avoid 
national humiliation resulted in a pan-
demic that has killed well more than 
600,000 people globally. It is unaccept-
able, and we must hold China account-
able. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of this amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CURTIS), my good friend, to speak 
on the amendment. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my legislation, the 
Li Wenliang Global Health Public Ac-
countability Act that would sanction 
any senior foreign official who conceals 
information dealing with the outbreak 
of a pandemic, including COVID–19. 
On December 30, 2019, Li Wenliang 
warned his medical school classmates 
of an outbreak of a SARS-like virus 
over WeChat. 
Wuhan’s Public Security Bureau de-
tained, questioned, and forced Dr. Li to 
sign a letter confessing he made false 
comments that severely disturbed the 
social order. Tragically, ironically, 5 
weeks later on February 7, 2020, Dr. Li 
died of a severe case of COVID–19. 
A study published in March indicated 
that if Chinese authorities had acted 
just 3 weeks earlier, the number of 
coronavirus cases could have been re-
duced by 95 percent and its geographic 
spread limited. 
By suppressing critical public health 
information, officials abroad have dem-
onstrated they care more about main-
taining their grip on power than the 
health and wellbeing of the world popu-
lation. 
This bill will change that by ensuring 
these cronies will not see the perks cre-
ated by their corruption. 
By passing this bill today, we will 
honor Dr. Li, set the global standard 
for transparency, and crack down on 
corruption and human rights abuses. I 
respectfully ask my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation and urge my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question, 
so that we can consider my bill. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we really do not have 
time to waste. Not only must we pro-
vide for the American people, but we 
have the added responsibility of con-
tinuing to fight and recover from the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
I hope my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will see the futility of 
passing purely partisan appropriations 
bills. That being said, there are provi-
sions included in this bill where we can 
all agree, and I hope we can sit down 
and negotiate with the other side so we 
can prevent a disruption at the end of 
the fiscal year for the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the 
rule, ‘‘no’’ on the underlying measure, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
With this appropriations bill we are 
responding to the crisis of today while 
preparing for tomorrow. Americans are 
out of work, struggling to make ends 
meet as this virus wreaks havoc on our 
health, on our healthcare system, and 
on our economy. 
The American people deserve a fund-
ing bill that makes smart investments, 
and this bill does just that. It addresses 
the hunger that is plaguing working 
families. It increases broadband access. 
It strengthens our international alli-
ances. It combats climate change. It 
increases funding to provide healthcare 
for veterans. This bill invests in Amer-
ica and our collective future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mr. BURGESS is as fol-
lows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1060 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 7733) to authorize the imposition of 
sanctions with respect to the deliberate con-
cealment or distortion of information about 
public health emergencies of international 
concern, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the 
bill shall be considered for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. 
When the committee rises and reports the 
bill back to the House with a recommenda-
tion that the bill do pass, the previous ques-
tion shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill and amendments thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except one mo-
tion to recommit with or without instruc-
tions. If the Committee of the Whole rises 
and reports that it has come to no resolution 
on the bill, then on the next legislative day 
the House shall, immediately after the third 
daily order of business under clause 1 of rule 
XIV, resolve into the Committee of the

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House

tempore (Mr. HIMES) at 2 o’clock and 4 
minutes p.m. 
CONTINUATION 
OF 
NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
MALI—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–138) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared with respect 
to the situation in Mali in Executive 
Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond July 26, 2020. 
The situation in Mali, including re-
peated violations of ceasefire arrange-
ments made pursuant to the 2015 
Agreement on Peace and Reconcili-
ation in Mali; the expansion of ter-
rorist activities into southern and cen-
tral Mali; the intensification of drug 
trafficking and trafficking in persons, 
human rights abuses, and hostage-tak-
ing; and the intensification of attacks 
against civilians, the Malian defense 
and security forces, the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabiliza-
tion Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and 
international security presences, con-
tinues to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13882 with respect to the situation in 
Mali.

eral agreement’’ refers to a framework bilateral 
agreement between the Government of the 
United States and the government of the coun-
try receiving assistance that describes the privi-
leges and immunities applicable to United States 
foreign assistance for such country generally, or 
an individual agreement between the Govern-
ment of the United States and such government 
that describes, among other things, the treat-
ment for tax purposes that will be accorded the 
United States assistance provided under that 
agreement.

RESERVATIONS OF FUNDS 
SEC. 7014. (a) REPROGRAMMING.—Funds ap-
propriated under titles III through VI of this 
Act which are specifically designated may be re-
programmed for other programs within the same 
account notwithstanding the designation if com-

by operation of any provision of this or any 
other Act: Provided, That any such reprogram-
ming shall be subject to the regular notification 
procedures of the Committees on Appropriations:

tivities by this or any other Act may be extended 
for an additional fiscal year if the Secretary of 
State or the USAID Administrator, as appro-
priate, determines and reports promptly to the

nation of assistance to a country or a signifi-
cant change in circumstances makes it unlikely 
that such designated funds can be obligated

vided, That such designated funds that con-
tinue to be available for an additional fiscal 
year shall be obligated only for the purpose of 
such designation.

peace in the region and to United States invest-
ment and trade in the Middle East and North

tral Office for the Boycott of Israel immediately 
disbanded; 
(3) all Arab League states should normalize 
relations with their neighbor Israel; 
(4) the President and the Secretary of State 
should continue to vigorously oppose the Arab 
League boycott of Israel and find concrete steps

termining to sell weapons to said country; and

annually on specific steps being taken by the 
United States to encourage Arab League states 
to normalize their relations with Israel to bring

cott of Israel, including those to encourage al-
lies and trading partners of the United States to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 23, 2020 
(2) In 2018, unemployment in the Palestinian 
territories was 32.4 percent. Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) growth in the Palestinian terri-
tories declined from 2017 to 2019, and it is pro-
jected to further decline in 2020. 
(3) According to the World Bank Ad Hoc Liai-
son Committee’s April 2019 Economic Monitoring 
Report, 
‘‘to 
achieve 
sustainable 
economic 
growth, in the Palestinian territories, growth 
and job creation going forward will need to be 
private sector driven’’. 
(4) According to the 2018 Joint Strategic Plan 
of the Department of State and the United 
States Agency for International Development, 
‘‘assistance can help prevent new recruitment to 
terrorist organizations, reduce levels of violence, 
promote legitimate governance structures that 
strengthen inclusion, and reduce policies that 
marginalize communities’’. 
(5) Although economic development is an im-
portant tool for stabilizing conflict-prone set-
tings and establishing connections between com-
munities, economic development by itself will 
not lead to lasting peace. People-to-people 
peace-building programs further advance rec-
onciliation efforts by promoting greater under-
standing, mutual trust, and cooperation be-
tween communities. 
(6) While the United States and its inter-
national partners continue to support diplo-
matic and political negotiations between the 
representatives of the parties to the Israeli-Pal-
estinian conflict, such efforts require broad pop-
ular support among the people on the ground to 
succeed. 
(7) Achieving sustainable, high-level agree-
ments for lasting peace in the Middle East must 
come through, and with the support of, the peo-
ple who live there, and the United States and its 
international partners can help the people of 
the region build popular support for sustainable 
agreements for lasting peace. 
SEC. 9003. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) building a viable Palestinian economy is 
central to the effort to preserve the possibility of 
a negotiated settlement leading to a sustainable 
two-state solution with the democratic, Jewish 
state of Israel and a demilitarized, democratic 
Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace, se-
curity, and mutual recognition; 
(2) United States and international support 
for grassroots, people-to-people efforts aimed at 
fostering tolerance, and building support for a 
such solution, can help counter extremist propa-
ganda and the growing issue of incitement; 
(3) strengthening engagement between Pal-
estinians, Israelis, and through people-to-people 
peace-building programs can increase the bonds 
of friendship and understanding; 
(4) investing in the development of the Pales-
tinian economy and in joint economic ventures 
can advance multiple sectors to the benefit of 
local, regional, and global parties; and 
(5) Congress encourages cooperation between 
Palestinian, American, and Israeli business sec-
tors in order to benefit the Palestinian, Amer-
ican, and Israeli peoples and economies.

dian Affairs or the Bureau of Indian Education

mination Act or the Tribal Self-Governance Act 
of 1994 (Public Law 103–413). 
In the event any tribe returns appropriations 
made available by this Act to the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs or the Bureau of Indian Education, 
this action shall not diminish the Federal Gov-
ernment’s trust responsibility to that tribe, or 
the government-to-government relationship be-
tween the United States and that tribe, or that 
tribe’s ability to access future appropriations. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
no funds available to the Bureau of Indian 
Education, other than the amounts provided 
herein for assistance to public schools under 25 
U.S.C. 452 et seq., shall be available to support

Interior may waive this prohibition to support 
expansion of up to one additional grade when 
the Secretary determines such waiver is needed 
to support accomplishment of the mission of the 
Bureau of Indian Education, or more than one 
grade to expand the elementary grade structure 
for Bureau-funded schools with a K–2 grade 
structure on October 1, 1996. Appropriations 
made available in this or any prior Act for 
schools funded by the Bureau shall be available, 
in accordance with the Bureau’s funding for-
mula, only to the schools in the Bureau school 
system as of September 1, 1996, and to any

school at a Bureau-funded school (as that term 
is defined in section 1141 of the Education 
Amendments of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 2021)), except 
that a charter school that is in existence on the 
date of the enactment of this Act and that has 
operated at a Bureau-funded school before Sep-
tember 1, 1999, may continue to operate during 
that period, but only if the charter school pays 
to the Bureau a pro rata share of funds to reim-
burse the Bureau for the use of the real and per-
sonal property (including buses and vans), the 
funds of the charter school are kept separate 
and apart from Bureau funds, and the Bureau 
does not assume any obligation for charter 
school programs of the State in which the school 
is located if the charter school loses such fund-
ing. Employees of Bureau-funded schools shar-
ing a campus with a charter school and per-

retary shall continue to distribute indirect and 
administrative cost funds to such grantee using 
the section 5(f) distribution formula. 
Funds available under this Act may not be 
used to establish satellite locations of schools in 
the Bureau school system as of September 1, 
1996, except that the Secretary may waive this 
prohibition in order for an Indian tribe to pro-
vide language and cultural immersion edu-
cational programs for non-public schools located 
within the jurisdictional area of the tribal gov-
ernment which exclusively serve tribal members, 
do not include grades beyond those currently 
served at the existing Bureau-funded school, 
provide an educational environment with edu-
cator presence and academic facilities com-
parable to the Bureau-funded school, comply 
with all applicable Tribal, Federal, or State 
health and safety standards, and the Americans

project, as defined by section 2801 of title 10, 
United States Code, for any of fiscal years 2016 
through 2020 or for fiscal year 2021 may be obli-

(1) a project to construct a wall, barrier,

(2) a road to provide access to a wall, barrier,

funds were appropriated for any of fiscal years 
2016 through 2020, but that were rescinded or 
postponed by reason of the declaration of a na-
tional emergency on February 15, 2019. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies Appropriations Act, 2021’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This minibus combines four bills: 
State and Foreign Operations; Agri-
culture, Rural Development, FDA; In-
terior, Environment; and Military Con-
struction and Veterans Affairs. 
The package is the product of months 
of thoughtful deliberation and input 
from Members on both sides of the 
aisle. I am proud of the work we have 
completed under the incredibly dif-
ficult circumstances of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
This appropriations package address-
es urgent national priorities. I would 
like to highlight a few of our key suc-
cesses that our cardinals have secured: 
strong funding and protections to help 
put nutritious food on people’s tables 
during this time of economic crisis and 
rising food insecurity; increased invest-
ments in broadband to connect more 
Americans to work, school, healthcare, 
and family; robust funding to protect 
the environment and build resilience to 
climate change; and $12.5 billion in 
emergency funding to address sharply 
rising veterans’ healthcare costs. 
I am proud that the package also in-
cludes strong emergency appropria-
tions to confront coronavirus and sup-
port economic recovery, with invest-
ments in critical infrastructure and 
coronavirus 
preparedness, 
response, 
and relief domestically and globally. 
Turning to the State and Foreign Op-
erations division, it is bittersweet to 
bring my last State and Foreign Oper-
ations bill to the floor before I retire. 
As subcommittee chairwoman or rank-
ing member for two of my three dec-
ades here, I am honored to have been 
entrusted with this responsibility on 
this bill that has been a key compo-
nent of United States foreign policy 
since World War II. 
The work of the subcommittee has 
been marked historically by biparti-
sanship, and I thank former Chair and 
Ranking Member HAL
ROGERS
and 
former Chair and Ranking Member KAY 
GRANGER for their partnership to ad-
vance this vital legislation each year. 
Pivotal moments, from September 
11th to the devastation the coronavirus 
pandemic continues to cause, under-
score the significant value of foreign 
aid. It promotes freedom and democ-
racy and supports global development 
and security, all of which increase sta-
bility and mitigate threats to Ameri-
cans here at home. 
Indeed, our own children and grand-
children are more secure as a result of 
the United States’ foreign assistance 
that has made the world better, safer, 
and healthier for generations, efforts 
that are continued in the fiscal year 
2021 State and Foreign Operations bill 
we consider today. 
With a total of $65.87 billion, it re-
jects the President’s go-it-alone ap-
proach to foreign policy. The bill in-
cludes $47.85 billion in base funding, $8 
billion in Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations funds for base requirements that 
otherwise would not be funded by the 
President’s budget request, and $10.018 
billion in urgently needed coronavirus 
emergency funding to mitigate COVID– 
19’s impact on our health and economy. 
To ensure this pandemic does not de-
rail decades of development gains, this 
bill provides $3.8 billion in base funding 
for development assistance. This in-
cludes $975 million to increase access 
to basic education, of which not less 
than $150 million shall be spent on 
girls’ education in areas of conflict. 
It effectively addresses food insecu-
rity, poor water and sanitation serv-
ices, trafficking in persons, and other 
long-term development objectives. 
The bill’s holistic approach to global 
health seeks to bolster low- and mid-
dle-income countries’ management of 
health threats and communicable dis-
eases. 
It would sustain progress against 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria 
with $5.93 billion for global HIV/AIDS 
activities, including $1.56 billion for 
the Global Fund, for which it clarifies 
the United States’ commitment to our 
33 percent share. 
It also reverses the President’s global 
gag rule, stops counterproductive re-
strictions 
on 
family 
planning 
and 
health funding, and includes $805.5 mil-
lion for family planning services, of 
which $55.5 million is for the United 
Nations Population Fund. 
The bill provides restoration of funds 
for the World Health Organization to 
ensure American influence in an orga-
nization critical to the development 
and distribution of vaccines. 
b 1415 
To address policies of the administra-
tion that harm our neighbors and drive 
migration, the bill amends prior-year 
appropriations acts to significantly 
limit the President’s ability to redirect 
assistance outside of the region. 
It also maintains robust funding for 
counternarcotics and law enforcement 
efforts in Colombia, Mexico, Central 
America, and the Caribbean; includes 
$68 million to address international or-
ganized crime; and maintains funding 
to combat cybercrime. 
The bill provides $9 billion for secu-
rity assistance to key allies and part-
ners with support for programs in East-
ern Europe, Jordan, and Tunisia. It 
keeps the commitments of the United 
States at Camp David to promote peace 
in the Middle East by providing $3.3 
billion in aid for Israel’s security as 
well as assistance for Egypt. 
It restores humanitarian and devel-
opment assistance to Palestinians with 
resources to organizations working in 
the West Bank and Gaza, and it ad-
vances a bipartisan priority, with $50 
million to fund a new partnership for 
peace that would strengthen economic 
development and engagement between 
Palestinians and Israelis. It includes 
$7.83 billion in refugee and disaster as-
sistance, including to Latin America, 
the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. 
Additionally, the bill prioritizes the 
security of diplomatic and develop-
ment staff and facilities with $6.071 bil-
lion for embassy security, which is 
$692.2 million above the President’s re-
quest. 
To effectively engage allies and re-
claim our leadership role, this bill reaf-
firms our support for international 
partners and multilateral organiza-
tions, which extends the impact of our 
assistance, and facilitates delivery of 
urgent aid to mitigate human suf-
fering. 
Lastly, to combat the destabilizing 
and persistent threats posed by climate 
change, the bill provides funds in this 
and prior acts to support multilateral 
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions. It also strengthens conservation 
and environment programs and con-
tinues funding for adaptation and re-
newable energy programs at prior-year 
levels. 
This bill reflects our common belief 
in the absolute necessity of effective 
diplomacy, global engagement, and ro-
bust development assistance to protect 
our own national security even as we 
address moral imperatives beyond our 
own borders. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
my 
sub-
committee staff who have worked in 
difficult circumstances to prepare the 
bill, including Majority Clerk Steve 
Marchese; staff Craig Higgins, Erin 
Kolodjeski,

fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills to 
be considered by the House. I wish the 
circumstances were different and I 
could support this very important 
piece of legislation that funds many 
key programs. 
This bill supports the veterans who 
have honorably served our country, the 
diplomats who promote American busi-
nesses and our values around the world, 
the farmers and ranchers who put food 
on our tables, and the custodians of our 
parks and public lands who protect our 
national treasures. 
Unfortunately, I am not able to sup-
port this bill before us because it has 
some fatal flaws. 
First, there are many policy provi-
sions similar to the partisan legisla-
tion the majority has pushed through 
the House the last few months. 
Second, the spending levels exceed 
the amounts the Congress and the 
President agreed to just last year. 
While I acknowledge the hard work 
Chairwoman LOWEY and her staff have 
done 
under 
very 
difficult 
cir-
cumstances, these bills do not reflect 
the way our committee typically does 
its business. 
Instead of building consensus with 
Members on our side of the aisle, these 
bills contain policy and funding pro-
posals that appear to have been dic-
tated from the top down. For example, 
the bill jeopardizes our security by pro-
hibiting funds from being used to ad-
dress the crisis on our southern border 
and by restricting the President’s abil-
ity to respond to a national emergency. 
Provisions are included that would 
permanently prevent any administra-
tion from implementing reforms to 
programs that help lift many Ameri-
cans out of poverty. 
The bill reverses course on nearly all 
of the language that was negotiated 
last year in the State, Foreign Oper-
ations bill to protect life. It does away 
with current policies that stop foreign 
organizations from receiving funds if 
they provide abortions. 
I am also disappointed to see that 
longstanding provisions aimed at en-
hancing transparency at the United 
Nations were removed. These condi-
tions have made an impact on these 
agencies, and they should be continued. 
There are also new directives added 
that would jeopardize America’s energy 
independence, and instead of rolling 
back burdensome environmental regu-
lations to help America’s businesses, 
this bill prevents many commonsense 
policies from being put in place and 
takes out key provisions from prior 
years. 
The bill also contains billions of dol-
lars in emergency spending. $15 billion 
is included for infrastructure. 
Even 
though 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee has held more than 100 
hearings and briefings this year, these 
proposals were never formally consid-
ered, and there were no discussions 
with Members on our side of the aisle. 
This is disappointing. 
Another $10 billion is included to ad-
dress coronavirus, even though a $3 
trillion bill passed the House in May 
and the Senate is planning to consider 
that bill in the next few weeks. 
In addition, $12.5 billion of veterans 
funding is unnecessarily designated as 
emergency, even though it was known 
that this spending would be needed 
when the budget agreement was en-
acted last year. 
We must work together on appropria-
tions bills that avoid controversial leg-
islative language and meet agreed- 
upon spending levels. This is the only 
way to get bills through the House and 
the Senate and signed into law. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to vote against this 
package, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. BISHOP), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
me the time, and I rise in support of 
H.R. 7608. 
As chairman of the Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee, I am pleased to high-
light the national priorities that are 
funded in the division that is covered 
in this bill. 
First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank our distinguished ranking mem-
ber, Mr. FORTENBERRY. I hope he is not 
getting too embarrassed by my endless 
thanks and praise, but it is really gen-
uine. 
Drafting legislation can be com-
plicated, but we have been able to 
maintain an open line of communica-
tion, and I am proud of our bipartisan 
relationship. We have produced a good 
work product that makes important in-
vestments that will improve the life of 
every American. 
Our fiscal year 2021 allocation is al-
most $24 billion, 2 percent above the 
fiscal year 2020 and more than $4.1 bil-
lion above the budget request. 
The bill provides $3.2 billion for rural 
development initiatives to fund critical 
infrastructure, 
such 
as 
water 
and 
wastewater systems, and rural housing 
needs. 
The bill also funds the ReConnect 
Program at $990 million, which is an 
increase of $435 million, or 78 percent. I 
am extremely proud of the investments 
that we make to close the digital di-
vide. The coronavirus pandemic has 
made everyone aware of just how im-
portant it is for students and workers 
to be connected to the internet, and 
our bill reflects that. 
The bill, once again, includes the 10– 
20–30 antipoverty formula for Rural De-
velopment programs that is designed to 
target much-needed Federal resources 
to rural communities in need. Per-
sistent-poverty communities for too 
long have suffered from neglect, and 
this provision will assist in reversing 
that and help these communities to 
thrive. 
The bill provides $1.83 billion for 
farm production programs. I am par-
ticularly proud of the $33 million in 
loan authority that will help resolve 
ownership and succession of farmland 
issues, also known as the ‘‘heirs’ prop-
erty’’ issue, which predominantly af-
fects Black farmers and has led to the 
loss of millions and millions of acres of 
privately held farmland for over a cen-
tury. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
hunger has become a new reality for 
millions of Americans, and our bill 
fully funds the SNAP, child nutrition, 
and WIC programs to meet the ex-
pected participation in fiscal year 2021. 
We also provided a big boost, $45 mil-
lion, 18 percent, to the Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program, which 
serves the elderly poor. 
Our bill also blocks two unconscion-
able SNAP rules. The Able-Bodied 
Adults Without Dependents final rule 
and the Standard Utility Allowance 
proposed rule are both designed to re-
strict program eligibility. 
The bill provides $3.3 billion for agri-
cultural research to ensure that Amer-
ica retains its role as the leader of 
global agricultural science. That num-
ber includes an increase of $29.5 million 
for programs that support the 1890 
land-grant institutions. 
We rejected the administration’s pro-
posed elimination of the Food for 
Peace and the McGovern-Dole pro-
grams. Respectively, we provide $1.775 
billion and $235 million for these pro-
grams, which is an increase totaling 
$65 million, to ensure that American 
agriculture remains an essential tool of 
diplomacy. 
The Food and Drug Administration is 
funded at $3.2 billion in discretionary 
funding, the increased funding dedi-
cated to new initiatives that would ad-
vance influenza vaccine technologies 
and enhance the safety of medical 
products and the Nation’s food supply, 
especially in light of COVID–19. 
The bill also gives the FDA the au-
thority to require mandatory recalls of

unsafe

over-the- 
counter drugs. This is the same author-
ity that the FDA already has to recall 
unsafe foods, infant formula, vaccines, 
and medical devices, a need that has 
become increasingly apparent in the 
past few weeks. 
The bill also funds the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission at $304 
million, which is the same as the ad-
ministration’s request. 
Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of 
this division of the minibus, and I am 
supportive of the whole package. I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my per-
sonal staff, Michael Reed and Maya 
Solomon; and the subcommittee staff, 
Martha Foley, Diem-Linh Jones, Perry 
Yates, Joe Layman, Randy Staples, 
Justin Masucci, and our intern Xavier 
Roberts for their hard work on the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank Tom 
O’Brien of the minority staff of the 
subcommittee as well as the minority 
staff of the full committee, and a spe-
cial thanks to our majority clerk, 
Shalanda Young, for her steady hand in 
leading the majority full committee 
staff.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. I yield the gentleman 
from Georgia an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member GRANGER for 
her hard work and her commitment 
and her public service. 
Finally, I want to say a special thank 
you to Chairwoman LOWEY. This is 
likely to be her last Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, and Related Agencies appro-
priations bill, and it has been a tre-
mendous pleasure and honor working 
with her. We will miss her. But Ameri-
cans and people all over the world are 
better for her many years of service to 
this Congress. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS), the former chair-
man of the full committee, and ranking 
member of the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, my 
ranking member, for yielding this 
time; and I rise in opposition to H.R. 
7608, the first appropriations measure 
to be considered by the House for fiscal 
year 2021. 
The measure before us today, Mr. 
Speaker, includes four of the 12 annual 
spending bills. Specifically, it would 
provide funding for the Departments of 
State, Agriculture, Interior, as well as 
Veterans Affairs, and their related 
agencies and programs. 
As ranking member of the State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Subcommittee, I want to again 
offer my sincere thanks to Chairwoman 
NITA LOWEY for her collaboration. Her 
decision to lead this subcommittee, as 
well as being chairman of the big com-
mittee, the full committee, is a testa-
ment to her dedication to improving 
lives around the globe. 
She has been a tremendous partner in 
that venture for many years, and we 
will deeply miss her leadership of our 
committee and of this subcommittee. 
But I assure you, Madam Chair, we will 
continue this work in your memory be-
cause you have invested so much of 
your life in this subcommittee. 
Division A, the State and Foreign 
Operations appropriations bill for fis-
cal year 2021, includes $55.85 billion in 
non-emergency discretionary funding, 
and $10 billion in emergency funding 
for global coronavirus response, for a 
total of $65.87 billion. 
Within that total, the bill includes 
funding for many key priorities that 
are critical to our national security. 
Chief among them is $3.3 billion in For-
eign Military Financing for Israel and 
continued funding at the current level 
for our close partners in the region, in-
cluding Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, and 
Tunisia. 
I am also pleased that the bill main-
tains funding at the current level, as 
has been said, for embassy security. 
The attacks on our embassy in Bagh-
dad this year were a stark reminder of 
how we must do everything we can to 
support the safety of our foreign serv-
ice officers working abroad. 
I appreciate the Chair continuing 
funding to combat the flow of drugs 
into 
this 
country 
and 
to 
tackle 
transnational crime overseas. Overdose 
deaths from synthetic opioids like 
fentanyl have spiked with COVID–19’s 
growth, so we have got an epidemic 
now of increased overdose deaths with-
in the pandemonium that is going on 
as well. These international efforts go 
hand-in-hand with the work we do here 
at home in the relentless fight against 
drug abuse and addiction. 
Elsewhere in the bill, Divisions B, C, 
and D of this package include some no-
table areas of bipartisanship worth 
highlighting. I was pleased to see ro-
bust funding for clean and reliable 
water systems and rural broadband 
service, which are vitally important in 
my Kentucky district. 
The bill also continues funding for 
the Abandoned Mine Land Pilot Pro-
gram, a crucial economic and commu-
nity development tool for regions like 
mine that were devastated by the war 
on coal. 
The bill also provides critical re-
sources to take care of our veterans, 
another welcome inclusion, given their 
great service to our Nation. 
While I admire the chair’s leadership 
in guiding this legislation through 
committee under the most challenging 
circumstances, I simply cannot support 
the measure in its current form. 
Our committee has a proud tradition 
of bipartisanship and working together 
to fund and enhance shared priorities. 
However, this bill’s unchecked emer-
gency spending and partisan policy rid-
ers give me great concern, and ensure 
it has no hope of becoming law in its 
current form. 
Sweeping measures that threaten the 
sanctity of life, like those that over-
turn the President’s expanded Mexico 
City policy and weaken the long-
standing protections against coercive 
abortion 
and 
forced 
sterilization, 
known as Kemp-Kasten, are the most 
concerning and controversial. 
Also problematic are ill-advised in-
vestments, including the international 
climate funds like the Green Climate 
Fund, which jeopardizes American jobs. 
Despite some areas of agreement, the 
unrestrained spending and partisan rid-
ers require my opposition to the pack-
age. I therefore urge my colleagues to 
oppose the bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. I con-
gratulate her for her work over the 
years. She and I spent over 2 decades 
serving together on that committee, 
the Appropriations Committee, and the 
same amount of time serving on the 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee 
of 
that 
Appropriations 
Committee; and I enjoyed her insight 
and her wisdom and her hard work, and 
I thank her for what she has done for 
the committee and what she has done 
for the country. 
I also want to thank the Staff Direc-
tor of the committee, Shalanda Young, 
who clearly is one of the most out-
standing members of the Congressional 
staff on either side of the Capitol. She 
has been tireless in working with Mrs. 
LOWEY to bring bills to the floor and, 
particularly with respect to our re-
sponse to COVID–19, has performed ex-
traordinary services. 
Frankly, but for the Appropriations 
Committee and its staff on both sides 
of the aisle, we would not have been 
able to do that; so I thank all those in-
volved. 
Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat infa-
mous, I suppose, on my side of the aisle 
with some other committee chairs and 
staff, for wanting to make sure that we 
do our work on appropriation bills. 
Frankly, there are so many impor-
tant bills that this House and Senate 
pass and the President signs. Unfortu-
nately, that hasn’t been the case late-
ly, but usually is the case. But these 
bills must pass. 
If the American people are going to 
continue to enjoy the services of their 
government, in so many critical ways 
to their lives, then the Appropriations 
Committee must do its job. We have 
been blessed that we have as chair and 
ranking member two Members who 
care about that process in Mrs. LOWEY 
and Ms. GRANGER. 
I also had the opportunity of serving 
some period of time with Ms. GRANGER 
on the Appropriations Committee. She 
is a woman and Representative that I 
have great respect for and appreciate

her attitude and collegial effort to 
work together. 
I regret that these will not be bipar-
tisan bills. Frankly, I think it is not so 
much because of the appropriations bill 
as it is because of the context in which 
we find ourselves in Washington, and in 
our country today. 
The House is getting its work done 
for the people, and passing these appro-
priations bills well in advance of the 
end of the fiscal year, as we did last 
year. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Sen-
ate is on track to fail to mark up a sin-
gle bill in committee, which may be 
the first time ever that that has been 
the case. 
Sadly, it is consistent with their not 
passing any other bills either, so 275 of 
our bills sit untended in the United 
States Senate. Why? 
Because, as former appropriator and 
former 
Senate 
Budget 
Committee 
Chair Senator Judd Gregg said: ‘‘I 
don’t see any reason why they should 
go to markup if the goal of that mark-
up is to simply create political fodder 
for the election, rather than move the 
bills forward.’’ 
That bleak assessment speaks di-
rectly to the harmful effects of Senate 
Republicans’ policy choices, because in 
this body, and in the Democratic Cau-
cus, we believe appropriations bills are 
a statement of our values and an op-
portunity to communicate them to the 
American people. 
We have a saying, all of us, put your 
money where your mouth is. And if you 
don’t do that, then your mouth is ar-
ticulating things that you may not 
really believe in, but you think it is 
useful for people to hear. 
This package contains important and 
positive investments in our people, our 
economy, and in our national security 
that reflect House Democrats’ commit-
ment to governing for the people and, 
very frankly, I think, for the most 
part, Republican values, which is why I 
am so disappointed that this will not 
be a bipartisan effort. 
It reflects our priorities for moving 
America forward and helping our peo-
ple get ahead. 
This bill will help ensure that chil-
dren and families receive the assist-
ance they need through SNAP and WIC 
to protect against hunger, an extraor-
dinary challenge in today’s COVID–19- 
afflicted America. 
It strengthens our conservation ef-
forts and ensures a cleaner environ-
ment. And we passed an extraordinary 
historical bill yesterday in a bipartisan 
fashion to accomplish that objective as 
well. 
In particular, I am pleased it includes 
funding for the Chesapeake Bay pro-
gram, so vital to my State and to our 
region. 
We are taking steps as well to pro-
tect the Arctic National Wildlife Ref-
uge, and this package will require that 
the National Park Service will move 
any commemorative displays honoring 
the Confederacy, so that no American 
will be either humiliated or denigrated 
as they visit our national parks. 
The bill also ensures we provide re-
sources to support our veterans, so 
critical, and across the board, felt to be 
a moral responsibility. We are standing 
with our servicemembers by prohib-
iting, frankly, the President from 
stealing funds from our military in 
order to build this wall that he said the 
Mexicans were going to pay for. No-
body believed it then; nobody believes 
it now. And he is taking money from 
our troops, from our military security, 
to build that wall. 
b 1445 
I am proud that this bill continues 
America’s strong and robust support 
for our ally Israel. 
In all, this is a funding package of 
which our country and this House can 
be proud. It reflects our values and our 
principles, and it is focused on gov-
erning responsibly and spending tax-
payer resources wisely. 
Sadly, it will, in all likelihood, join 
the more than 275 other bipartisan 
House bills languishing in the Repub-
lican-controlled Senate. We have a lot 
of new judges; we just don’t have legis-
lation for the people. 
I urge the Senate to do its part to 
avoid even the risk of another shut-
down. Just a few 18 months ago, 19 
months ago, we came into this Con-
gress with much of the Government of 
the United States shut down because 
the previous Congress had not funded 
the government. I urge the Senate to 
do its part. Let’s get the job done to-
gether for the people. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair, I 
thank the ranking member, I thank 
the staff on both sides of the aisle, and 
I thank Shalanda Young. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CARTER), who is the ranking mem-
ber of the Military Construction, Vet-
erans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
about division D of H.R. 7608, the Mili-
tary Construction and Veterans Affairs 
appropriations bill for fiscal year 2021. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
have focused on three things: soldiers, 
their families, and veterans. It is an 
honor to serve as the ranking member 
of the appropriations subcommittee 
that has their interests in the forefront 
of our minds. 
Overall, I strongly support the fund-
ing provided for military construction 
projects. I am pleased the bill includes 
funding for the services’ unfunded pri-
orities: privatized military housing, re-
silient and energy-efficient installa-
tions, and cleanup of contaminated 
sites. 
On a bipartisan basis, the bill in-
creases funding for women veterans, 
mental health and homeless programs, 
and supports construction of new VA 
facilities. 
Veterans have earned special atten-
tion for their service and sacrifice. In 
many ways, this bill helps to fulfill our 
promises to them. 
However, unfortunately and regret-
fully, I must express my opposition to 
H.R. 7608. Less than a year ago, we 
agreed to the 2019 Bipartisan Budget 
Act. I believe it is irresponsible to des-
ignate some funding as emergency just 
to avoid the caps set by that act. This 
is especially true since we all acknowl-
edged the growing costs of veterans’ 
healthcare programs when we agreed to 
the budget deal. 
I recognize the budget realities we 
face, but we should not unravel that 
agreement through this year’s appro-
priations process. I am also concerned 
that this bill includes provisions that 
limit the President’s ability to address 
the national emergency on our south-
ern border. 
Regardless of one’s position, the fact 
remains that cartels and criminal 
gangs take advantage of our political 
disagreements and continue to flood 
our Nation with dangerous and illegal 
drugs and exploit and traffic men, 
women, and children seeking a better 
life. This is unacceptable. 
While I oppose the final passage of 
the bill, I believe that the committee 
can continue to work together to fund 
programs important to soldiers, their 
families, and veterans in a responsible 
manner. 
In closing, I would like to thank my 
subcommittee 
chairwoman, 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, for her dedica-
tion to our subcommittee and its re-
sponsibilities. Also, I want to thank 
Chairwoman LOWEY for her service and 
leadership in this Congress, and I want 
to thank Ranking Member GRANGER 
for her support and commitment to en-
acting responsible spending bills. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), who is the dis-
tinguished chair of the Subcommittee 
on Interior, Environment, and Related 
Agencies. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to support the fiscal year 2021 Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies ap-
propriations bill. Thank you to my 
partner 
in 
this, 
Ranking 
Member 
JOYCE, for his collaboration and part-
nership throughout this process. I am 
grateful for the leadership of Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member 
GRANGER. 
Last year, House Democrats secured 
significant new investments in envi-
ronmental protection and land con-
servation. This bill builds on those suc-
cesses to advance priorities of Amer-
ican families, ensuring that we have 
clean air and clean water to protect 
our children’s health. We protect our 
most special places and endangered 
species and take meaningful actions to 
address climate change. 
The subcommittee recommends a 
total of $36.8 billion in discretionary 
funding, an increase of $771 million 
over last year’s enacted level.

The bill also includes $2.4 billion in 
fire cap adjusted funds for suppression 
operations. 
The bill includes an additional $15 
billion in emergency-designated infra-
structure investments. These invest-
ments will increase access to quality 
healthcare and education and help 
clean up contaminated lands, polluted 
water, and unhealthy air. 
With 
yesterday’s 
passage 
of 
the 
Great American Outdoors Act in fiscal 
year 2021, the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund will be fully funded at 
$900 million, the first time this has 
happened in over 40 years. 
I thank all of our constituents for 
making this passage a reality. 
Back to this bill. We reject the dan-
gerous policies and funding cuts pro-
posed by the Trump administration. In-
stead, we move forward by investing 
our resources in ways that keep our 
communities safe and healthy. We in-
vest in protection and preservation of 
our landscapes and our biodiversity. 
I am particularly proud that this bill 
includes protections for our Nation’s 
most visited wilderness, the Boundary 
Waters. It will put a halt to the use of 
funds in the next fiscal year to review 
or approve mine plans in the watershed 
of this treasured wilderness. 
But let me be clear: The operations 
of the current taconite mines of Min-
nesota’s iron ore range are not im-
pacted. There are no iron mines with 
plans under review. But there is a for-
eign-owned mining conglomerate with 
a plan under review for a toxic copper- 
sulfide ore mine on the doorstep of the 
Boundary Waters. The Trump adminis-
tration cannot be trusted to conduct 
this environmental review. 
Multiple Cabinet members pledged in 
congressional hearings to complete a 
mineral withdrawal study within this 
very watershed. Instead, they aban-
doned the congressionally directed en-
vironmental review after 20 months, 4 
months from completion, and they 
refuse to release results. 
This bill seeks to protect the Bound-
ary Waters from an administration 
that has shown a lack of transparency, 
respect for science, or the ability to 
follow 
our 
Nation’s 
environmental 
laws. 
Our subcommittee continues its non-
partisan approach to issues facing our 
Native American brothers and sisters. 
We provide $3.5 billion for the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian 
Education, and the Office of the Spe-
cial Trustee for American Indians, and 
$6.5 billion to the Indian Health Serv-
ice. This is another step in the right di-
rection toward upholding the Federal 
Government’s trust and treaty obliga-
tions, but the work continues. 
The bill contains provisions related 
to ending the use of Confederate sym-
bols on our public lands. Confederate 
flags and memorials have long been 
symbols of oppression and discrimina-
tion, and I am committed to doing ev-
erything we can to help this country 
confront and heal its legacy of racism. 
This is not about erasing our history, 
but it is about whether we are willing 
to do the hard work that is needed to 
confront the truth of our history and 
to work to right past wrongs. 
This is a good bill that works to tell 
the history of our country, even though 
sometimes it is painful to do so. It is a 
good bill that strives to use our nat-
ural resources wisely to protect our 
air, our water, and our land and to 
clean up those places that have been 
polluted in the past. This bill embraces 
conservation and the judicial use of our 
public lands, and yes, at times, it seeks 
to showcase the beauty of our natural 
resources that have been given to us by 
our creator. 
This is a good bill, and I encourage 
Members of this House to support it. 
I want to thank staff on both sides of 
the aisle for their hard work, including 
Rita, Jocelyn, Kusai, Janet, Peter, 
Donna, Tyler, Kristen, Darren, and Re-
becca Taylor on my personal staff. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. FORTENBERRY), who is the 
ranking member of the Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
want 
to 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER for yielding. But first, let me 
acknowledge the service of our chair, 
Mrs. LOWEY. I am so grateful for her 
graciousness, friendship, and especially 
the extraordinary example the gentle-
woman sets in working with Ranking 
Member GRANGER, for the shepherding 
of our great committee. I thank the 
gentlewoman so much for her service. 
I also want to thank my good friend, 
Chairman BISHOP, for the close work-
ing relationship that we have devel-
oped. Chairman BISHOP
has worked 
very hard to accommodate the many 
requests from our side of the aisle. I 
really value the constructive manner 
in which he was able to express his per-
spective, and we were able to work to-
gether toward constructive outcomes. 
The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that 
this bill largely reflects the coopera-
tive spirit of the agricultural commu-
nity in America as well as this com-
mittee. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, if I could divert 
for a moment, I want to tell a little 
story. My daughter Christine is 17. She 
got up at about 4:30 this morning. Blur-
ry-eyed, she made her way over to a 
local parking lot, got on a bus, and 
went about 30 miles into a cornfield 
where she and many other young peo-
ple begin to pick the tassels off the 
corn, fighting off rash and insects. 
They work most of the day until it is 
too hot to work anymore. She will 
come home tired and exhausted, and 
tomorrow, she and others will get up 
and do it again and again. 
This is a rite of passage in Nebraska. 
It is called detasseling. What it does is 
it creates this beautiful, lifelong lesson 
for young people, connecting effort to 
reward and the satisfaction of a job 
well done. 
So it is with the farmer, Mr. Speaker. 
Agriculture, in so many ways, both 
provides and unifies, and that is why I 
am proud to be ranking member of the 
subcommittee. 
Whatever policy differences we may 
have, particularly over budgets or 
transitional work requirements, it is 
clear that this bill affects the life of 
every American in many, many impor-
tant ways. 
I would like to highlight three of 
those: food security, rural broadband, 
and our Nation’s drug supply. 
First, this bill makes sure that vul-
nerable Americans have proper nutri-
tion. Members on both sides of the 
aisle have shown strong support for nu-
trition programs, including the wom-
en’s, infants’, and children’s nutrition 
program called WIC and the Com-
modity Supplemental Food Program 
for the needy elderly. There are many 
other nutrition programs that receive 
strong support, as well. 
Our committee and the entire Con-
gress have worked well together to 
meet our current needs and to build 
upon these base programs to support 
those who have suffered the indignity 
of food insecurity, which is heightened 
right now during the midst of this pan-
demic. 
Second, our health not only depends 
upon good food, but it depends upon 
the integrity of our drug supply. 
During 
the 
pandemic, 
America 
learned what we here already knew: We 
are importing drugs and drug ingredi-
ents from countries that do not nec-
essarily share our commitment to 
transparency, quality, or the protec-
tion of labor. 
Approximately 80 percent of our ac-
tive pharmaceutical ingredients are 
sourced from outside of the United 
States. The bill directs the FDA to 
block entry of products from those 
drug manufacturing plants overseas 
that prevent immediate inspection just 
like we have in America. Frankly, Mr. 
Speaker, I would be more comfortable 
if I saw the ‘‘Made in America’’ label 
on each prescription bottle. 
Third, telehealth, tele-education, and 
telework are here to stay and are revo-
lutionizing the way we think about and 
structure community. But here is our 
problem: Too many parts of the coun-
try don’t have access to high-speed 
internet, about 35 percent of rural 
areas and, as has been noted, some 
urban areas as well. 
A 
mother 
from 
Columbus, 
Ne-
braska—a community that is rural in 
character of about 25,000 people—re-
cently told us that she had to drive to 
the local public school parking lot in 
order to access their broadband and 
their WiFi to help her child do home-
work. I think we can do better than 
this, Mr. Speaker. 
This bill does provide over $1 billion 
of funding for the expansion of rural 
broadband and new metrics to measure

its success. Because it is not just about 
service providers or wires laid; it is 
about functionality and the mission of 
what I call creating an ecosystem of 
livability. 
The ideas behind what is tradition-
ally called rural development really do 
need to change. The farm of the future 
concept will be driven by data-driven 
solutions, precision agriculture, and re-
silient ag practices that increase pro-
ductivity, generate value-added prod-
ucts, enhance sustainability in ag com-
munities, and put an important empha-
sis on local foods in addition to the ex-
pansion of the opportunities for tele-
health, telework, and tele-education. 
b 1500 
I want to also note something that 
Chairman BISHOP
has done. He has 
placed an important emphasis on ex-
panding resources to historically Black 
colleges 
and 
universities, 
an 
area 
where we can all look for enhanced op-
portunity. 
Let me note the current challenges 
at the source of a disagreement in the 
bill. 
One of the objections relates to the 
budget used by the majority to fund 
these 12 bills in violation of the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019. 
Another objection is less about num-
bers and more about our commitment 
to one another. The problem is that the 
bill permanently disallows any future 
changes on work requirements in the 
SNAP program. From my perspective, 
when times are good and the economy 
is strong, the program should be al-
lowed to adjust accordingly as persons 
seek meaningful work. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to con-
tinuing our work together to improve 
this bill and, once we do so, to poten-
tially pass it into law. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 51⁄2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from New York, Chairwoman LOWEY, 
for yielding and for all of her hard 
work and leadership during this proc-
ess and for her distinguished years of 
service. I am sad this is the last time 
that we will do this together, but I am 
so appreciative of her leadership and 
mentorship of me personally. I will 
truly, truly miss her. 
Mr. Speaker, the Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies division of the bill highlights 
our continued commitment to our serv-
icemembers and their families and to 
our veterans. 
Constructing the barracks, bases, and 
facilities that our military needs is 
crucial to our country’s military readi-
ness. Properly funding the Department 
of Veterans Affairs is how we deliver 
on the promise of medical care and 
other benefits that our veterans have 
earned through service to our Nation. 
The related agencies, including the 
American Battle Monuments Commis-
sion and Arlington National Cemetery, 
demonstrate to the world how we 
honor the sacrifices of those who 
served. That is why I am proud this bill 
includes $115.5 billion in discretionary 
funding, which is a $5.1 billion increase 
above the enacted fiscal year 2020 fund-
ing level and $2.3 billion above the 
President’s budget request. 
For Military Construction, we pro-
vided $10.1 billion, rejecting the Presi-
dent’s proposed cut of $3.6 billion below 
the current level for critical infra-
structure needs on military installa-
tions. This includes $439.5 million for 
the Energy Resilience and Conserva-
tion Investment Program, which is $297 
million above the request, and $1.49 bil-
lion for family housing construction, 
which is $135 million above the request, 
as well. We added these resources in 
order to fund critical oversight to ad-
dress unacceptable conditions in mili-
tary 
family 
housing, 
like 
mold, 
vermin, and lead. 
Mr. Speaker, $200 million is provided 
to clean up PFOS and PFOA contami-
nation at previously closed installa-
tions. 
The bill also includes a new provision 
to 
prohibit 
military 
construction 
projects on installations named for 
Confederate officers until a process is 
initiated to rename those bases. No 
servicemember should live or train on 
a base named for a person who be-
trayed America’s pursuit of a more per-
fect Union. 
For the VA, this bill provides a total 
of $240.2 billion, including mandatory 
spending; $104.8 billion is discretionary 
funding. This amount represents an in-
crease of $12.3 billion above the fiscal 
year 2020 enacted level. 
The $90 billion within this total for 
VA medical care fully funds the budget 
request. 
I am proud that this bill will improve 
the quality of veterans’ healthcare 
through 
significant 
investments 
in 
women’s veterans’ health, the ‘‘whole 
health’’ model, mental health and sui-
cide prevention, homelessness assist-
ance, rural health, and opioid abuse 
prevention. 
We also finally achieved consensus 
with the Senate that the cost of VA 
healthcare cannot remain within the 
budget caps. So $12.5 billion within the 
overall total of $104.8 billion for VA 
programs is designated as emergency 
funding 
to 
adequately 
fund 
VA 
healthcare for its more than 7.2 million 
patients. 
The bill boosts funding for VA re-
search by 5 percent over the fiscal year 
2020 enacted level to support the impor-
tant work studying rare cancers and 
prosthetics for women veterans, just to 
name a few. 
It also provides funding for infra-
structure improvements to ensure the 
VA has modern, safe facilities to treat 
our veterans, as well as supports con-
tinued implementation of the Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization 
implementation and efforts to reduce 
the disability claims backlog. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what this 
bill does, but I am equally proud of 
what it does not do. 
It does not fund the border wall, nor 
does it allow the President to bypass 
congressional intent and divert vital 
military construction funding from 
previously approved national security 
projects in support of an ineffective, 
unnecessary barrier. We cannot allow 
Presidential bigotry and xenophobia to 
be prioritized over American lives, our 
servicemembers, or our national secu-
rity. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking 
member, subcommittee partner, Judge 
Carter, and Ranking Member GRANGER. 
We worked very well together. And 
while we may not always agree on 
these issues, we are agreeable, and I am 
proud to have them as partners and 
friends and truly appreciate their in-
sights. 
I also thank the staff of both the sub-
committee and in our personal offices, 
whose expertise and commitment to 
our servicemembers and our veterans is 
evident every day. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, it is 
a strong bill, and, most importantly, it 
does right by our servicemembers, 
their families, and our veterans. 
I also would briefly discuss a few of 
our accomplishments in the other divi-
sions of this minibus. 
The Agriculture division supports 
our Nation’s farmers, strongly invests 
in lifesaving nutrition programs, like 
WIC and SNAP, and blocks Trump’s 
cruel SNAP regulations. 
The bill also includes funding and 
language to strengthen the regulation 
of e-cigarettes to break the epidemic of 
nicotine addiction that is gripping our 
Nation’s youth. 
The Interior division protects our in-
valuable public lands, invests in cli-
mate resilience, and helps us restore 
our crumbling infrastructure, like the 
sewage failures in Fort Lauderdale. 
And I am particularly pleased that the 
bill includes language I requested that 
would block offshore drilling in any 
new area, including Florida’s coast-
lines. 
Finally, the State and Foreign Oper-
ations division empowers women by in-
creasing funding for international fam-
ily planning and health programs. The 
bill expands aid for those struggling 
within Venezuela and for the refugees 
fleeing the economic collapse and op-
pression of the Maduro regime, and it 
ensures our ally, Israel, can defend her-
self, which is critical to our national 
security. 
Mr. Speaker, I personally thank our 
incredible staff: Lisa Molyneux, our 
clerk; Jennifer Hollrah; Sarah Young; 
Nicole Cohen; Keihysha Cenord; Lauren 
Wolman, on my personal staff; Michael 
Harris on my personal staff; and, of 
course, Shalanda Young, our intrepid 
clerk of our full committee, and the 
entire front office staff as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this spending package, and I 
thank everyone for their hard work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3796 
July 23, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JOYCE), the ranking member of 
Subcommittee on Interior, Environ-
ment, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 7608. 
Before I get into the details of divi-
sion C, the Interior and Environment 
section of the bill, I take a moment to 
thank Chairwoman LOWEY and Rank-
ing Member GRANGER for their stead-
fast leadership on the Committee on 
Appropriations. 
I extend my thanks to my friend and 
colleague, BETTY MCCOLLUM, the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Interior, Envi-
ronment, 
Related 
Agencies. 
Chair 
MCCOLLUM has been an excellent lead-
er, and I am glad to have the oppor-
tunity to serve alongside her as the 
ranking member on the subcommittee. 
Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2021 Inte-
rior, Environment bill includes many 
bipartisan initiatives to conserve and 
protect our natural resources and to 
increase the Federal commitment to 
honor our treaties and trust respon-
sibilities with American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. 
The bill increases investments in 
wildfire suppression, hazardous fuels 
activities, provides additional support 
for the National Park Service, EPA’s 
rural 
water 
technical 
assistance 
grants, and fully funds the Payments 
in Lieu of Taxes program. 
The bill also provides significant 
funding—more than one-quarter of the 
bill—to help Tribal communities across 
Indian Country with healthcare, edu-
cation, and law enforcement needs. 
This support is essential given, on a 
per capita basis, COVID–19 has hit In-
dian Country harder than any other 
area in our Nation. 
As a co-chair of the Bipartisan Task 
Force to End Sexual Violence, I was 
pleased to see critical funding included 
to implement the Violence Against 
Woman Act in Indian Country and to 
support Operation Lady Justice, an ini-
tiative established by the President to 
address missing and murdered indige-
nous people, human trafficking, and 
other violent crimes. 
Chair MCCOLLUM and her staff have 
worked hard to accommodate these re-
quests for Members on both sides of the 
aisle in the bill. They will be appre-
ciated by our constituents, regardless 
of party. 
In particular, I am grateful for the 
continued, robust investment in the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, 
which is essential to reducing harmful 
algal blooms, eradicating Asian carp, 
and addressing coastline erosion. 
However, despite these investments 
and bipartisan priorities, there are con-
cerns in this bill that will need to be 
addressed before we reach bipartisan 
agreement. 
First and foremost, the bill adds sev-
eral new controversial policy riders, 
administrative provisions, and report 
language directives. These partisan 
provisions prevent the administration 
from reducing regulatory burdens and 
limit responsible natural resource de-
velopment. 
Limiting our domestic supply of 
much-needed natural resources does 
not decrease our demand for them, it 
only makes us more dependent on for-
eign nations to obtain them, which is 
not only a national security concern, 
but is also an economic security con-
cern. We cannot protect American jobs 
if we cannot supply them with the en-
ergy and raw materials. 
This bill also eliminates several long-
standing commonsense provisions that 
have enjoyed bipartisan support for 
many years. Adding these provisions 
back will be essential to reaching a bi-
partisan agreement. 
A final area of concern is the funding 
level proposed in this bill. This bill 
benefits from off-budget emergency 
funding provided in other bills, and in-
stead of using the savings from the pas-
sage of the Great American Outdoors 
Act towards paying down our ever- 
growing national debt, the bill reallo-
cates those funds. 
The bill also includes a new title, 
with $15 billion in so-called emergency 
spending for additional infrastructure. 
To be clear, there are critical infra-
structure programs in this bill that 
need these funds and more, but that 
alone does not give the Federal Gov-
ernment license to continue to borrow 
and spend without any overarching 
plan for fiscal responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, it is for a combination 
of these funding and policy reasons 
that I cannot support this bill at this 
time and in its current form, but I am 
committed to working with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle as we 
move through the fiscal year 2021 proc-
ess to craft a bill that can receive bi-
partisan support. 
Mr. Speaker, until then, I strongly 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this package. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member, 
Ms. GRANGER, and Chair LOWEY. Also, I 
give thanks to Chair MCCOLLUM and 
also Ranking Member JOYCE on the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee for Interior 
for allowing the provision that I am 
going to speak about to be included in 
today’s legislation. 
It is very important because this in-
clusion was language from a bill that I 
introduced, the Springfield Race Riot 
National Historic Monument Act, and 
that is in the fiscal year 2021 Interior 
Appropriations bill. 
Mr. Speaker, my bill would designate 
the 1908 Springfield Race Riots, which 
ultimately played an integral role in 
the formation of the NAACP, it would 
designate the site of those race riots. 
For over the last few years, because 
of a Federal project, we have been un-
covering artifacts from those race 
riots. We want to tell a story about 
those race riots and why America and 
Springfield, Illinois, should never have 
anything like that happen again. This 
language would authorize the Park 
Service to conduct a special resource 
study to determine its eligibility into 
the park system. 
Thank you, again, to all who have 
made this a possibility. Building off 
conversations that we had on the floor 
yesterday, I am grateful for this oppor-
tunity to further engage in the impor-
tant discussions that we are having 
surrounding race in this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to sup-
porting a final package that includes 
this language to give this site and the 
events that occurred there proper rec-
ognition. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, in times like this, it is easy 
to understand why we have a social 
safety net. 
Today, 6 million more Americans are 
on food stamps than were in February. 
Now, SNAP encourages work and edu-
cation. Those are the critical ingredi-
ents in upward mobility. And by de-
sign, those requirements are flexible 
enough to account for difficult eco-
nomic times. 
Despite that flexibility, the majority 
is using this appropriations process to 
prohibit future administrations from 
more effectively encouraging work and 
education. 
Now, yes, we are in difficult eco-
nomic times, but as our economy re-
covers, work and education will be 
even more important. By setting aside 
that emphasis, we are not improving 
our country. We are not reducing de-
pendence. We are not improving eco-
nomic opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
reconsider. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, this pack-
age of appropriations bills will help 
make our Nations stronger at home 
and respected again in the world. 
Together, we can bolster food secu-
rity, combat climate change, protect 
our environment, aid the world’s most 
vulnerable people, and meet our com-
mitments to our veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. 
KAPTUR. 
I 
applaud 
Chairwoman 
LOWEY in her resolve to accomplish Congress’ 
top Constitutional priority assuring the oper-
ation of the government of the United States 
and in record speed this year, despite a global 
pandemic. Today’s bold Appropriation minibus,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3797 
July 23, 2020 
and Environment, and Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs, reflects historic invest-
ments to meet the needs of the American peo-
ple and strengthen our national resolve during 
an unprecedented period in American history. 
Here are a handful of provisions that make 
this bill strong. 
The bill prioritizes U.S. national security in-
terests, including at liberty’s edge in Central 
and Eastern Europe. It takes valuable steps to 
combat Russian aggression, it demonstrates 
our unwavering support for liberty in Ukraine, 
funds diplomatic exchanges between the U.S. 
and Poland, and protects Radio Free Europe’s 
longstanding editorial independence. 
Then with acute food insecurity exposed in 
the pandemic, this bill advances sustainable 
agriculture in this era of climate change. It pro-
vides much needed support to hungry Ameri-
cans, while giving rebirth to an idea cultivated 
by the Greatest Generation, Victory Gardens 
so every American family can reconnect with 
the power of earth to sustain life. 
As a lifelong resident of Toledo, Ohio, the 
distress from which our beloved Lake Erie and 
all our Great Lakes have struggled as a result 
of harmful algal blooms and invasive species 
like Grass Carp is a daily concern. For the last 
decade, we’ve lived with putrid green algae 
floating atop Lake Erie’s Western Basin and 
tributaries, causing environmental, economic, 
and public health crises in the process. That’s 
why I’ve fought to increase federal funding for 
projects like the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative, which will receive $335 million in this 
bill and other fresh water sources. 
This bill says thank you to America’s vet-
erans, from general healthcare and mental 
health services, to suicide prevention and 
homeless assistance. This legislation makes 
historic investments to improve the delivery of 
care, with extra focus on women veterans. It 
also, underscores the importance of the VA’s 
workforce and makes recruitment and reten-
tion a top priority. 
These examples are but a few of the worthy 
causes included in this effort that make Amer-
ica even greater. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislative package dem-
onstrates the good a unified Congress can 
achieve when we work together, even during 
a pandemic where much of our work has been 
carried out remotely. I would like to thank 
Chairwoman LOWEY for her remarkable leader-
ship throughout this process, as well as each 
of the subcommittee chairs for their dutiful 
work getting this legislation across the finish 
line. I urge strong bipartisan support. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey, Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak on provisions of H.R. 7608. 
Someday, future generations of Americans 
will look back on us and wonder how and why 
a society that prided itself on its commitment 
to human rights, precluded virtually all protec-
tion to the weakest and most vulnerable—un-
born children. 
I believe they will demand to know why dis-
membering a child with razor-sharp knives, 
pulverizing an infant with powerful suction de-
vices, or chemically poisoning a baby with any 
number of toxic ‘‘medications’’, failed to elicit 
empathy for victim-babies. 
The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, re-
verses several modest but important pro-life 
polices including the Protecting Life in Global 
Health Assistance Policy—which is a reiter-
ation and expansion of President Ronald Rea-
gan’s Mexico City Policy. 
Announced by Reagan at the United Na-
tions Conference on Population Control in 
Mexico City in 1984—hence its name—the 
policy was and is designed to ensure that U.S. 
taxpayer money is not funneled to foreign non- 
governmental organizations (NGOs) that per-
form or promote abortion as a method of fam-
ily planning. 
I would note parenthetically, that over the 
years, I’ve sponsored many amendments on 
this floor to protect the Mexico City Policy, be-
ginning in 1985. 
The policy restored by President Trump, 
now called the Protecting Life in Global Health 
Assistance Policy, established pro-child safe-
guards—benign, 
humane 
conditions—on 
about $8.8 billion in annual global health as-
sistance. 
For years—under Presidents Clinton and 
Obama—foreign non-governmental organiza-
tions (NGOs) had been empowered by U.S. 
taxpayer grant money—to weaken, undermine, 
or reverse prolife laws in other nations and to 
destroy the precious lives of unborn children. 
Many countries throughout the world have 
been besieged by aggressive and well-funded 
campaigns to overturn their pro-life laws and 
policies. 
The Protecting Life in Global Health Assist-
ance Policy mitigates U.S. taxpayer complicity 
in global abortion. 
U.S. foreign policy—and the foreign entities 
we fund with billions of dollars in grant 
money—should consistently affirm, care for, 
and tangibly assist women and children—in-
cluding unborn baby girls and boys. 
Mr. Speaker, I am the prime author of sev-
eral humanitarian and human rights laws in-
cluding the historic Trafficking Victims Protec-
tion Act, the $30 billion five year reauthoriza-
tion of the President’s Emergency Plan for 
Aids Relief (PEPFAR), End Neglected Tropical 
Diseases, the Autism CARES Act, the Frank 
Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, the 
Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act, and 
much more. 
I am the prime author of the Microenterprise 
Results and Accountability Act and a second 
microenterprise law to help the poor, espe-
cially women, escape poverty through micro-
enterprise grants, credit assistance, business 
development training—and self-sufficiency. 
I believe we must increase access to mater-
nal and prenatal care and ensure access to 
safe blood and better nutrition for all women- 
especially those living in poverty. 
We must also expand essential obstetrical 
services, including skilled birth attendants, 
while improving transportation to emergency 
care facilities to significantly reduce maternal 
mortality and morbidity—including from obstet-
ric fistula. 
I wrote a bill—the Foreign Relations Act of 
2006–7—that passed the House. I included a 
life-saving provision to establish 12 fistula cen-
ters mostly in Africa. 
When the Senate failed to act on my com-
prehensive bill, I asked USAID’s Kent Hill to 
initiate a fistula repair program by administra-
tive action. He did. Approximately fifty-four 
thousand women have had a life-changing fis-
tula surgical repair. 
Mr. Speaker, prioritizing programs that en-
sure adequate nutrition and supplementation 
for moms and children during the all-important 
first 1,000 days of life—from conception to the 
second birthday—are among the most trans-
formative, life-enhancing commitments that 
can be made. 
I’ve chaired several hearings on the stun-
ning impact of the first 1000 days and in-
cluded the initiative in my bill that passed the 
House—the Global Food Security Act. 
Expanding all these initiatives make women 
and children healthier, stronger, and more re-
silient to disease and disability while reducing 
death and injury. 
No one is expendable or a throwaway. 
Mr. Speaker, birth is merely an event—al-
beit an important one—in the life of a child. 
Victim-babies and their mothers absolutely 
deserve respect, protection, and an abun-
dance of compassion. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7608, and I commend and 
thank the chairman and chairwomen who 
worked very hard to produce funding bills that 
reflect our ‘‘For the People’’ vision for Amer-
ica. 
This mini-bus composed of the State and 
Foreign Operations, the Agriculture, Interior 
and the Military Construction and Veterans Af-
fairs appropriations bills provides critical re-
sources for a wide range of our important do-
mestic and international priorities. 
While there is much to be thankful for in this 
mini-bus, I would like to highlight a few of the 
many critical protections I requested for vul-
nerable animals which these subcommittee 
chairs graciously included in their bills. 
This bill defunds dog testing at the Veterans 
Administration and prohibits notorious Class B 
dealers from selling illegally acquired pets into 
research. It also provides emergency shelter 
options for domestic violence survivors with 
companion animals. 
It prevents horses from being slaughtered in 
America for human consumption and cracks 
down on the painful practice of horse soring. 
It pushes FDA to reduce primate testing and 
to retiree these animals to sanctuary. 
Finally, the mini-bus combats wildlife poach-
ing and trafficking around the world and pro-
vides recovery funding for endangered species 
like the California Condor. 
Madam Speaker, Mahatma Gandhi once 
said the greatness of a nation can be judged 
by the way its animals are treated. I thank 
Chairman BISHOP and Chairwomen LOWEY, 
MCCOLLUM and WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for dem-
onstrating what that greatness looks like. 
I urge my colleagues to support animal wel-
fare and our many ‘‘For the People’’ priorities 
and vote YES on H.R. 7608. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to the amendment to 
H.R. 7608 proposed by my colleagues, Mr. 
PERRY and Mr. JOYCE from Pennsylvania. The 
amendment would prohibit the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) from fulfilling the role 
outlined in an agreement that the Agency en-
tered into—along with six states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia—to restore the Chesapeake 
Bay. Like the rest of the Bay’s 64,000 square 
mile watershed, in my district in Hampton 
Roads, Virginia, healthy tributaries and a 
healthy Chesapeake are vital to the environ-
ment, the economy, recreation, wildlife and 
our way of life. 
Despite the vital importance of the Bay, how 
to best address its deterioration was a con-
cern for almost half a century. Prior to the 
states’ agreement with the EPA, their indi-
vidual efforts were largely unsuccessful. In 
2010, however, the Environmental Protection 
Agency established Total Maximum Daily 
Load, limits on nutrient and sediment pollution

to improve the Bay’s water quality. Though the 
work continues, this new level of coordination 
and federal-state cooperation has been very 
successful. Beyond the Chesapeake region, 
this level of coordination provides a unique 
precedent for other restoration efforts across 
the country. Unfortunately, this amendment 
would prohibit the EPA from fulfilling their cru-
cial role, one that the watershed states have 
agreed is necessary. History makes it clear 
that the collaboration and partnership of state, 
local, Federal, and non-governmental partners 
will be required to restore this national treas-
ure. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this 
amendment. 
I also rise in support of the amendment that 
my colleague Ms. Speier has introduced. I 
share the gentlewoman’s concern about forc-
ing non-federal entities that have faithfully 
worked with the EPA to secure funding for the 
very successful Water Infrastructure Finance 
and Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program to re-
apply. In my district in Hampton Roads, the 
SWIFT project—or the Sustainable Water Ini-
tiative for Tomorrow—is currently very close to 
closing a loan to move forward with their work 
to replenish the Potomac aquifer. Changing 
the application process for non-federal appli-
cants that are already so far along in the proc-
ess is wasteful and would unnecessarily delay 
projects that support access to safe and af-
fordable water for our communities. 
In the case of the innovative SWIFT project, 
the WIFIA program supports my community’s 
access to clean drinking water not only now, 
but also in the future as it recharges an aqui-
fer on which most of eastern Virginia depends 
for their drinking water. In addition to limiting 
the amount of treated water that would other-
wise be discharged into the James, Elizabeth, 
or York Rivers, this project would also yield 
enormous benefits to the entire region by 
slowing land subsidence, which is com-
pounded in the Hampton Roads region by 
sea-level rise. Importantly for agricultural pro-
ducers, the project also promises to slow the 
intrusion of saltwater into groundwater in the 
region. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting the WIFIA program and the many ben-
efits that it provides.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. ALLEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in House Report 116–459. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division A (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. lll. Each amount made available 
by this Act (other than an amount required 
to be made available by a provision of law) is 
hereby reduced by 5 percent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, once again this Con-
gress is being asked to vote on an enor-
mous spending package after being pro-
duced in just the last few weeks. 
How can the American people pos-
sibly have time to learn where their 
tax dollars are going? 
Today, we are considering amend-
ments to a four-bill, 689-page package 
that totals $219.6 billion in discre-
tionary spending, plus another $37.5 
billion in emergency spending. 
The bills in this package spend bil-
lions on top of what the current budget 
agreement allows, and they also con-
tain partisan poison pills, like over-
turning the administration’s Mexico 
City Policy, allowing foreign organiza-
tions to receive Federal funds, even if 
they perform abortions. 
Let me underscore, under the Demo-
crat majority, we can’t even stick to 
the budget that was agreed to. 
As a former business owner—and if 
you talk to any business owner, they 
will tell you the same thing—you have 
to operate within a budget. 
Every day, families across this coun-
try are sitting down at the kitchen 
table making tough choices to live 
within their means. 
I am appalled by the lack of fiscal re-
sponsibility being shown by this body 
today as we seem to hold ourselves to 
a different standard than American 
workers and families. 
Unfortunately, that is just business 
as usual in the 116th Congress. 
The level of appropriations for State 
Department and Foreign Operations, 
which is what this amendment is spe-
cifically targeting, is $8.5 billion higher 
than Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of 
nearly 15 percent. 
The bill continues funding normal ac-
tivities through Overseas Contingency 
Operations, rather than through the 
normal funding accounts, which is a 
mechanism that was originally set up 
to avoid spending constraints. 
My amendment today is simple. It 
would reduce State and Foreign Oper-
ations spending by 5 percent for Fiscal 
Year 2021. If you do the math, my 
amendment would cut about $3.3 bil-
lion. 
Even with my modest 5 percent cut, 
this division would still increase spend-
ing for Fiscal Year 2021 compared to 
Fiscal Year 2020. 
I believe my Democratic colleagues 
should support my amendment, since 
they will still be spending a lot of your 
hard-earned money, just a bit less than 
they initially intended. 
I want to be clear, though. I do not 
want to cut funding going towards our 
cherished and critical ally, Israel. 
I also want to know that our diplo-
matic efforts abroad are necessary. In 
fact, my son is currently living over-
seas and working on behalf of our Na-
tion’s interests. But it is important 
that we look at the balance sheet and 
make cuts wherever possible. 
We can no longer neglect our na-
tional debt crisis, and my colleagues 
must take a serious look at Wash-
ington spending and start to take back 
control. 
For the sake of our children and 
grandchildren, we must act imme-
diately to rein in Federal spending so 
we don’t leave our next generation 
with an insurmountable debt. 
Mr. Speaker, I am the proud grand-
father of 13 grandchildren, with one on 
the way, and I believe it is my duty to 
do everything in my power to avoid 
placing a $26 trillion and rising burden 
of debt on their backs. 
My amendment is just a small first 
step toward bringing fiscal responsi-
bility back to Washington. I urge all 
my colleagues in this body to support 
my amendment today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
time in opposition to the gentleman’s 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, our committee has 
worked hard on a bipartisan basis to 
craft a bill that provides the necessary 
tools to the Secretary of State and the 
USAID 
administrator 
to 
advance 
United States foreign policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I have long opposed 
amendments 
that 
indiscriminately 
apply across-the-board cuts to the 
carefully considered funding in this 
bill, which addressed many of the re-
quests brought to the committee from 
both Democrats and Republicans in the 
House. 
Such amendments make no provision 
for protecting high-priority programs 
and 
activities. 
For 
example, 
this 
amendment would cut $165 million

from security assistance for Israel. It 
would cut $457 million from global 
health programs, including $296 million 
less 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
activity. 
This 
amendment would cut $391 million 
from lifesaving humanitarian assist-
ance and $305 million from funds made 
available to protect our diplomats and 
development personnel and the facili-
ties in which they work and live over-
seas. 
In addition to assistance for our ally 
Israel, cuts would also impact funding 
for other key allies, such as Jordan, 
Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia, and coun-
tries in Eastern Europe that are bat-
tling 
Russian 
aggression 
and 
disinformation. 
I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
gentleman’s amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand we are in 
unprecedented times. But of the $10 bil-
lion in spending that Democrats say go 
towards international coronavirus re-
lief, only $2.5 billion is designated to 
health programs, and a significant 
amount of those funds are diverted 
away from coronavirus. 
And let me just say that I understand 
the need to work with our allies on a 
vaccine and global health response to 
the coronavirus, but I believe that our 
priorities should be focused on combat-
ting the virus here in the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot overstate the 
importance of restoring fiscal sanity 
here in the United States Congress. It 
is in the best interests of the future of 
our country that we take desperately 
needed steps to rein in our national 
debt. 
We are passing along to future gen-
erations an enormous debt burden. 
Does anybody understand that? I mean, 
can you imagine our children’s chil-
dren’s children’s children dealing with 
this? 
I would ask all my colleagues today 
to 
think 
about 
your 
kids, 
your 
grandkids, and your great-grandkids 
before casting your vote. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS), the distinguished 
ranking member on the State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
gentleman’s 
amendment. 
This 
bill 
funds a number of important programs 
that are part of our national security. 
While I believe there is room for a 
small reduction, taking cuts across the 
board is not an appropriate way to 
carry that out. 
The amendment would cut every-
thing across the bill, indiscriminately, 
and that includes the $3.3 billion, as 
has been mentioned, in foreign mili-
tary financing for Israel. Reducing 
funding for Israel’s security by $165 
million, in addition to reductions to 
embassy security and other key invest-
ments, is ill-advised. There is a better 
way. 
I urge Members to oppose the amend-
ment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, our national security is 
strongest when development, diplo-
macy, 
and 
defense 
are 
equally 
prioritized. This amendment under-
mines U.S. leadership and diminishes 
our engagement in the world. 
Yes, I do think of my eight grand-
children when I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the pre-
vious 
question

the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) 
and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
GRANGER) will each control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. Craig). 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, we owe our 
veterans our utmost respect and a debt 
that can never be repaid. 
Earlier this year, I testified for in-
creased mental health services, espe-
cially in rural communities, and in-
creased access to care on behalf of the 
veterans in Minnesota’s Second Con-
gressional District. 
I am proud that my legislation is in-
cluded in the bill that we will pass to-
morrow, and it includes the following: 
My amendment for a $1.5 million in-
crease in the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration medical services’ account to 
expand the Rural Health Resources 
Center’s program and increase funding 
for the Office of Rural Health so that 
they can continue their research to 
navigate barriers and expand access to 
care. 
I ask all of my colleagues to join me 
in stepping up to support our veterans. 
b 1530 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. STEWART). 
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to amendment No. 
69, sponsored by Representative COHEN 
from Tennessee, which is included in 
this en bloc. 
While I appreciate the gentleman’s 
concerns for our Nation’s wild horse 
and burros, and I don’t doubt that at 
all, the amendment is misguided and 
will actually end up hurting these ani-
mals more than it helps. 
I have been working on this issue for 
more than 6 years. There is nothing 
more important to the rural part of my 
district than is this, yet none of the 
sponsors of this amendment came to 
me to talk about this amendment. If 
they had come, I could have saved 
them some time. 
The amendment seeks to push the 
PZP contraceptive. The only problem 
with that is it doesn’t work. Instead, 
we should allow research scientists and 
the BLM to do their jobs in deter-
mining the best way to manage these 
herds. 
Tying their hands by earmarking 50 
percent of the increase on PZP birth 
control doesn’t allow them to follow 
the best science to maintain healthy 
herds and healthy ranges. If you care 
about these animals and if you don’t 
want to see them starve to death, then, 
please, work with us, and let’s defeat 
this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude, 
if I have a few more seconds. We have 
a diverse and bipartisan group that has 
been working on this, as I have, for 
many years. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), the co-chair 
of the DPCC. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the bipartisan en bloc 
amendment and three of my important 
amendments included in this package 
to address PFAS contamination. 
PFAS is a national health and envi-
ronmental crisis. It is growing in scope 
every day, contaminating our air, 
water, and soil. Michigan has been hit 
hard. But yesterday, we led in setting 
the standard in the absence of Federal 
action. 
My main amendment will ensure that 
the administration cannot withdraw 
their decision issued in January to pro-
ceed with the national drinking water 
standard for PFO and PFOS. It will 
also prevent the administration from 
reversing its efforts to designate these 
notorious chemicals as hazardous sub-
stances under the Superfund program, 
which will kick-start the cleanup proc-
ess at the most contaminated sites na-
tionwide. 
This 
amendment 
doesn’t 
go 
far 
enough, but it is a beginning to make 
sure we don’t go backward in our ef-
forts. I push all of my colleagues to 
join these efforts as cosponsors and 
thank Chair MCCOLLUM for her endur-
ing leadership in this year’s Interior 
appropriations bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
this bloc of bipartisan amendments, 
which contains two amendments I have 
offered with my friends across the 
aisle. 
Mr. SOTO and I introduced an amend-
ment which will support important fer-
tilizer 
research 
and 
development 
through the fertilizer management ini-
tiative, as this body authorized in the 
2018 Farm Bill. 
I also would like to speak on an 
amendment I offered with Mr. PA-
NETTA, which will empower agriculture 
employees to provide personal protec-
tive equipment for our essential agri-
culture workers. This pandemic has af-
fected every aspect of our lives, but 
what has not changed is the critical 
role that our farmers, our ranchers, 
and our agricultural employees play in 
putting food on our tables and securing 
our Nation’s food supply. 
It is my hope that this amendment 
will lead to a larger conversation about 
how we ensure the safety of those 
working hard to feed our country and 
strengthen our agricultural industry. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these amendments, and I look 
forward to continuing our bipartisan 
work. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, for more 
than 80 years, Hagia Sophia has served 
as a museum visited by people from all

around the globe. As a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site, it is an architectural 
masterpiece, with a complex history as 
a place of worship for both Christians 
and Muslims. 
Changing its status is an affront to 
religious pluralism, and it jeopardizes 
its standing. This amendment encour-
ages the State Department to denounce 
Turkey for taking this despicable ac-
tion and to engage for the purpose of 
returning its status to a museum. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, on be-
half of all veterans living rurally and 
remotely, I rise in support of my 
amendment included in this en bloc 
package. 
The amendment focuses additional 
efforts within the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration Office of Rural Health on 
solutions 
that 
will 
bring 
more 
connectivity to veterans living in rural 
and remote areas. 
My district features not just rural 
but remote communities where many 
veterans are unable to access high- 
speed broadband. The coronavirus has 
only further highlighted this digital di-
vide. 
The VA and Congress proactively re-
sponded to the pandemic with in-
creased telehealth resources for vet-
erans. This is a crucial and critical 
step, but what good is it for the vet-
erans 
who 
don’t 
have 
access 
to 
broadband in the first place? 
We need to keep our Nation’s prom-
ises to all veterans, including those liv-
ing in rural and remote communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 45 seconds to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of my amendment to H.R. 
7608, which provides an additional $1 
million for the VA to conduct edu-
cational outreach to veterans about 
the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn 
Pit Registry. 
My amendment will help veterans ex-
posed to burn pits by strengthening the 
burn pit registry and making patients 
aware of early warning signs of life- 
threatening illnesses as well as the ex-
istence of the registry. 
My amendment will also fund addi-
tional research on the health effects of 
burn pits, using the data from the reg-
istry. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
help our veterans exposed to burn pits 
by supporting my amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Alas-
ka (Mr. YOUNG), the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, Madam 
Chair, and Madam Ranking Member, 
this could be a good bill, but there are 
some provisions that shouldn’t be in it 
that were put in it. 
One is ANWR, which we passed in 
this House 13 times with help from 
both sides, open an Arctic wildlife 
range. There is a provision here to pro-
hibit that. 
There is also a provision not to re-
peal the roadless area in the Tongass 
National Forest. 
There is a provision about not allow-
ing the State of Alaska to control the 
fishing and hunting rights of the State 
of Alaska on Federal lands, as it is 
now. 
You know, I resent it. To allow other 
Members of Congress to come into your 
district or my district and tell us how 
we should represent them, this is not 
the way to do business. This is the 
House of the people, as representatives 
of the people, duly-elected from each 
constituent. 
Everyone that I know of in my State 
opposes these riders and these amend-
ments. But for some reason, there is a 
group that say, ‘‘Oh, we know better 
than the people,’’ the Congressmen. We 
know what is best for us, and it is not 
their district. 
The Tongass, for instance, is an area 
of 16 million acres of land. Prohibiting 
harvesting timber or access because of 
the roadless definition of the Obama 
administration is wrong. We have har-
vested less than 400 acres of that whole 
total 16 million acres of land. We are 
not asking to harvest that, but we 
want access for communities. And 
there are other parts of our State, 
lands within that forestland, but this 
provision, this rider, would preclude 
that. That is not representation from a 
Congress of the people. 
I have watched this body now in 48 
years dissolve into what I call an ad-
versarial position on both sides by 
label. That is not representation. These 
riders shouldn’t be in here. These 
amendments should not be accepted if 
you believe in the House of Congress 
for the people of America. If you don’t 
believe that, maybe we ought to set up 
a different system. These should not be 
in this bill. 
The bill, overall, is not a bad bill. I 
think it is pretty good. In fact, there 
are some good things in there for Alas-
ka. But you had to let these little mice 
come into the barn and eat the grain 
and leave residue behind. 
I am making a suggestion. When you 
write these bills, be very careful what 
you allow to be put in the bills that 
don’t apply to the bill and, in fact, are 
personal interests not only from those 
Congressmen that submitted them but 
wrong for the State of Alaska. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the two 
amendments that I have in the en bloc 
concern horses. 
One concerns wild horses and a more 
humane way to deal with the wild 
horse population. Right now, the Bu-
reau of Land Management uses heli-
copters, rounds them up, and puts them 
in pens for the rest of their lives. This 
would be a more humane practice and 
cost only 10 percent of their budget, 
and it would certainly be something 
the Rolling Stones would be for, ‘‘Wild 
Horses.’’ 
The other is one that would give 
money for an audit on the soring prac-
tices of Tennessee walkers, an inhu-
mane practice that has gone on for a 
long time. We need to be considerate of 
our four-legged friends, and this would 
support the walking horses. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful to see 
these included in the en bloc, and I am 
pleased to see this progress. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of my amendment to this 
appropriations package that highlights 
the need to use all the tools in Amer-
ica’s tool kit to counter the Chinese 
Communist Party and the totalitarian 
government in Beijing. 
My amendment shows bipartisan sup-
port for the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Cor-
poration and its important work to 
counter China’s Belt and Road Initia-
tive. 
As a member of the House’s China 
Task Force and former chair of the 
House 
Financial 
Service’s 
Sub-
committee on Monetary Policy and 
Trade with jurisdiction over the Treas-
ury Department’s national security 
portfolio, I am keenly aware of the 
threat that China poses through its 
Belt and Road Initiative and direct for-
eign investment internationally. 
While we will never match China dol-
lar for dollar in government subsidies, 
agencies like DFC can leverage the un-
limited potential of the private sector 
to counter China’s model of debt-trap 
diplomacy and colonialism. 
I am proud to support DFC in pro-
moting private investment in devel-
oping countries, its role in advancing 
U.S. global development goals and eco-
nomic interests, and offering an alter-
native to China’s malign investment 
overseas. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
adopt this amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to 
increase funding for the Airborne Haz-
ard and Burn Pit Center of Excellence. 
Burn pits have been called the Agent 
Orange of our generation. Too many of 
our veterans have been exposed to 
harmful chemicals from burn pits, 
which we know lead to increased risk 
of lung and respiratory diseases. We 
have seen this firsthand in my district 
due to the illnesses related to working 
on the burn pits on the pile in an area 
of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We must 
do more. 
The center located in New Jersey is 
doing critical research into the long- 
term health effects from burn pits, re-
search our veterans and healthcare 
providers need.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this package. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, this appro-
priations package continues to make 
important investments to restore and 
protect the environment of our beau-
tiful State of Florida. 
We have language in there encour-
aging the National Park Service to 
consider the Kissimmee River at the 
headwaters of the Everglades for the 
Wild and Scenic Rivers Program, one of 
the highlights of our district. 
Everglades restoration: over $15 mil-
lion, including $10 million for CERP. 
We 
help 
address 
harmful 
algal 
blooms that hurt our coast, including 
recognizing the threat and encouraging 
EPA for more support and research. 
We address the threats to the Great 
Florida Reef by recognizing the coral 
disease outbreak and recommending 
additional resources with State and 
local partners. 
We help out with sinkholes through-
out Florida by having the USGS iden-
tify and map them out so we can pro-
tect Floridians. 
We are also recognizing natural dis-
asters like the earthquake in Puerto 
Rico by continuing to develop new pro-
grams.

Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today to offer an amendment to 
protect our Nation’s farmworkers. 
This pandemic has shown that our 
farmworkers are absolutely essential. 
They show up to work every day to 
keep our communities fed and our Na-
tion’s food secure. But due to living 
and working conditions, many are 
uniquely susceptible to this disease. 
That is why we must dedicate imme-
diate and robust funds to the USDA to 
establish an emergency program that 
covers the cost of PPE and other safety 
measures to protect our farmworkers. 
And that is just the beginning. We 
need to provide our farmworkers with 
proper pay, job security, methods for 
childcare, family leave, and support for 
their families. 
Our farmworkers deserve and require 
action from the Federal Government to 
protect our food supply and our food 
security. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her 
tremendous 
leadership. 
I 
also 
thank 
Chairwoman 
MCCOLLUM
and 
Ranking Member JOYCE for working 
with me on this very important amend-
ment. 
In my congressional district in North 
Carolina resides the Uwharrie National 
Forest, which many of my constituents 
call home. This national treasure is a 
pillar of our community and brings 
folks from all across the Nation and 
the world to North Carolina every 
year. But for those who live in the 
Uwharrie National Forest, it looks a 
lot different. 
My constituents in the Green Gap 
community have had to contend with 
dangerous roads in the Uwharrie Na-
tional Forest for years while the For-
est Service has neglected their mainte-
nance. As someone who has seen first-
hand how dangerous these roads are, I 
can attest to the critical need to pave 
these roads. 
One of my constituents had a heart 
attack, and the ambulance couldn’t get 
down the road because of ruts and the 
washouts. Thankfully, the desperate 
but resourceful paramedics got out of 
the ambulance and sprinted down the 
road with a stretcher. 
Another one of my constituent’s 
house burned to the ground because the 
road was so impassable, the fire truck 
couldn’t get to the house to put out the 
blaze. 
Put yourself in the shoes of my con-
stituents. Imagine living with this fear 
every day. 
Working with me, the State of North 
Carolina has stepped up with financial 
assistance and agreed to maintain 
these roads. I am asking this Congress 
to also step up to ensure my constitu-
ents are not forgotten and they have 
access to critical lifesaving services 
they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in support of this package, 
which contains four amendments I in-
troduced. 
My first amendment supports the 
family-owned dairy farms, backbones 
of the rural economy in northwestern 
New Jersey, which are facing major 
challenges from the pandemic. 
Dairy farmers have suffered more 
than $5.7 billion in losses from the cri-
sis, and my amendment calls for sup-
port for the dairy farmers. 
My second amendment provides more 
resources for the inspector general of 
the VA to investigate and ensure prop-
er compliance of the State-run vet-
erans homes, like the disaster-stricken 
State-run New Jersey veterans home in 
Paramus, where 81 residents and one 
staff member tragically died from the 
coronavirus outbreak. My amendment 
will make much stronger Federal over-
sight of these facilities possible, which 
we need to protect our veterans. 
My third boosts investment for med-
ical care at non-VA facilities to con-
tinue our fight for greater access to 
healthcare for veterans in north Jer-
sey. 
And my fourth would increase invest-
ment for the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum’s outreach services. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from New Jersey an ad-
ditional 15 seconds. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, my 
fourth amendment would increase in-
vestment for the United States Holo-
caust Memorial Museum’s outreach 
services so more Americans can learn 
about the history of the Holocaust, 
anti-Semitism, and other forms of ha-
tred, bigotry, and intolerance. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bipartisan en bloc set of amendments. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of further research, production, and use of 
PZP–22, native PZP, GonaCon, and other re-
versible fertility control to help reduce our 
country’s untenable wild horse populations. 
Urgent action is needed to protect the wild 
horses and prevent further population in-
crease. 
I support and thank my colleague Rep-
resentative STEVE
COHEN
and those who 
joined him in the Appropriations amendment 
which calls for $11,000,000 for the Bureau of 
Land Management’s (BLM) Wild Horse and 
Burro Program budget. This funding would be 
used to implement a humane fertility treatment 
such as PZP, which is a reversible fertility 
control. This specific funding is a necessary 
and immediate measure that addresses the bi-
partisan call for humanely managing the wild 
horse population. 
In my district, the University of Toledo has 
led the way on research and production of 
PZP–22 for wild horse fertility control. BLM re-
cently confirmed that PZP remains a nec-
essary tool to control the wild herds. Unfortu-
nately, BLM is not utilizing PZP or fertility con-
trols to its fullest potential and is leaving re-
search capabilities unutilized. BLM has a duty 
to continue the research, production, and use 
of proven contraception such as PZP–22, 
while also pursuing other efforts toward their 
goal of a vaccine that can be administered 
quickly and cost effectively. The Cohen 
Amendment draws critical attention to these 
measures. 
I look forward to continuing to work with my 
colleagues in the House and the Bureau of 
Land Management to find a humane and ef-
fective solution to reversible fertility control. 
Until then, we must persist with proven revers-
ible fertility vaccines to quell the unsustainable 
wild horse population. 
I urge adoption of the Cohen Amendment. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the Chinese 
Communist Party’s aggression and malign 
conduct grows more severe each day. The 
CCP’s malfeasance allowed the COVID–19 
outbreak to become a global pandemic, caus-
ing untold economic destruction. They conduct 
militarized territorial aggression against most 
countries that border China. The CCP is pio-
neering a new form of colonialism, degrading 
the sovereignty of developing nations through 
debt and corruption, extracting resources and 
military outposts. They have orchestrated the 
largest transfer of wealth in human history

through state-directed economic espionage 
against the United States and other advanced 
economies. And the CCP is responsible for 
the gravest human rights atrocities occurring 
in the 21st century. The evidence is manifest 
that the malign influence of the CCP is the 
greatest United States foreign policy challenge 
of this generation. It affects every one of our 
states and districts, a fact that was under-
scored this week by the closure of China’s 
Houston consulate in response to multiple in-
stances of economic espionage. We must sus-
tain U.S. resources to counter this threat, so 
I am grateful that my amendment has been in-
cluded in a bipartisan en bloc package for 
H.R. 7608, the Fiscal Year 2021 State, For-
eign Operations, Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Interior, Environment, Military Construc-
tion, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. 
My amendment will partially restore the prior 
fiscal year’s funding levels for the Countering 
Chinese Influence Fund, helping to ensure 
that appropriate resources are available to ad-
dress this generational challenge. I’m glad that 
the House will address our leading foreign pol-
icy priority on a bipartisan basis, and thank my 
colleagues for supporting this measure to sus-
tain U.S. resources to counter the malign influ-
ence of the CCP. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment, numbered 40 to Divi-
sion B of H.R. 7608, to provide $750,000 for 
the National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s 
Agricultural and Food Research Initiative to re-
search innovative practices to increase carbon 
storage in agricultural land. My amendment 
identifies Enhanced Rock Weathering as a pri-
ority research area, with a focus especially on 
how this practice enhances carbon sequestra-
tion or may affect air quality and soil health. 
Additionally, my amendment requires that re-
search also identify any impacts this practice 
would have on workers and consumers. 
As discussed by a new major research 
study from the University of Sheffield, pub-
lished in Nature, adding rock dust to farmland 
could remove up to two billion tons of carbon 
dioxide from the air each year and help signifi-
cantly reduce our global CO2 footprint. The 
technique of adding crushed volcanic rock 
dust to farmland—known as ‘‘enhanced rock 
weathering’’—has shown great potential to in-
crease the soil’s extraction of carbon dioxide 
from the environment. 
However, there are significant gaps in this 
research, including the side effects of this 
method on public health for both farmworkers 
and neighboring communities, and USDA is 
not currently engaged in studying this par-
ticular practice. Clearly more research is need-
ed on this technology, and USDA is well-posi-
tioned to fund this work. 
I urge the adoption of this commonsense 
amendment to this en-bloc package. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment numbered 71 to Divi-
sion C of H.R. 7608 to increase base funding 
to $300,000 within the National Park Service 
budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 for the New 
England National Scenic Trail (NET). 
The NET was designated by the Omnibus 
Public Land Management Act of 2009 making 
it the newest of the nation’s 11 national scenic 
trails. The NET is a 220-mile hiking trail wind-
ing through 40 communities in Connecticut 
and Massachusetts. Nearly 2 million people 
live within 10 miles of the trail, and since the 
designation, excitement about the trail and ac-
tivities to improve the trail have continued to 
increase. The NET is managed through a part-
nership between the National Park Service 
and two of New England’s most established 
nonprofit trail and conservation organiza-
tions—the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), 
established in 1876, and the Connecticut For-
est & Park Association (CFPA), established in 
1895. 
Since designation, the NET has been flat- 
funded at an average level of $127,000 in Op-
eration of the National Park System funding, 
despite a conservative recommendation in its 
original 2005 NPS Trail Feasibility Study of an 
annual operating budget of $271,000. An in-
crease in base funding is needed to imple-
ment the federal portion of the Trail Manage-
ment Blueprint for the NET and to support the 
work of two trail partner organizations, the 
AMC and the CFPA. 
Based on more than a decade of experi-
ence with NET trail operations and needs, a 
total annual appropriation of $300,000 in FY 
2021 is recommended to fully fund this trail 
and to support the work of volunteers, regional 
partners, and youth trail crews as they exe-
cute improvements to trail infrastructure, trail 
protection and planning, and trail information 
and promotion. 
I urge adoption of this en-bloc package, and 
I want to thank Mr. HIMES, Ms. DELAURO, Mr. 
LARSON, Ms. HAYES, Mr. NEAL, and Mr. 
MCGOVERN
for their kind support for this 
measure. 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment to H.R. 7608, Division B—Agri-
culture, Rural Development Appropriations Act 
of 2021. My amendment, included in the bipar-
tisan en bloc, will increase funding for the 
Crop Protection and Pest Management pro-
gram by $1 million. In 2017, the Allium 
leafminer—an invasive pest that threatens 
onion crops—was discovered in Orange Coun-
ty’s black dirt region. Orange County produces 
half of New York State’s onion crop, generates 
$25 million in annual sales, and employs hun-
dreds of residents. So, my office got to work 
with Dr. Brian Nault of Cornell. By leveraging 
a grant from the Crop Protection and Pest 
Management program, Dr. Nault has been 
working to find effective and sustainable solu-
tions for managing the Allium leafminer. But 
he needs more help. My amendment will add 
$1 million into the program helping to save Or-
ange County’s onion crop. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank Chairwoman Lowey for the 
opportunity to bring this critical amendment to 
the floor. Her leadership of the Committee is 
matched only by her commitment to combat 
the nefarious rise of anti-Semitism around the 
world, and unfortunately here at home. 
I encourage my colleagues to support my 
amendment to the FY2021 State, Foreign Op-
erations, and Related Programs appropriations 
bill, to increase the Diplomatic Policy and Sup-
port account by $500,000 in order to double 
the amount allocated for the Office of the Spe-
cial Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semi-
tism (SEAS), Elan Carr. 
Over the last year, we’ve seen an increase 
in anti-Semitic rhetoric and violence directed 
against Jewish communities in the United 
States as well as around the world. In my 
home city of New York, hate crimes spiked by 
72 percent over the same period last year. 
We’ve also seen distressing cases of violence, 
like the terror attacks in Monsey during the 
celebration of Hanukkah and the assault 
against a synagogue in Halle, Germany. 
We’ve even seen anti-Semites target Jewish 
Members of Congress like me for daring to 
stand up to them. It is clear that need to be 
investing, now more than ever, to monitoring 
and combatting anti-Semitism wherever it 
rears its head. 
The Office of the Special Envoy, and espe-
cially Special Envoy Carr, have done incred-
ible work addressing this rise in global anti- 
Semitism. Yet the office currently has only 
three dedicated full-time staffers, including the 
Special Envoy himself, and a number of 
detailees. The critical work of the Special 
Envoy and his Assistant Envoys requires the 
staff and the commensurate budget with which 
to confront this challenge. By doubling the 
amount allocated for the office, the Special 
Envoy will be able to hire more staff, to in-
clude specialists and operations support, as 
well as increase their activities identifying anti- 
Semitism and sharing best practices with Jew-
ish communities around the world. 
This amendment will provide a much-need-
ed investment at a critical time for Jews 
around the world. I urge its inclusion in the 
House Appropriations package, and thank my 
colleagues for their support. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in strong support of Jackson Lee 
Amendments to H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign 
Operations, Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Interior, Environment, Military Construction, 
and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.’’ 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking 
Member COLE for making these Jackson Lee 
amendments in order for House consideration 
of H.R. 7608. 
These 
Jackson 
Lee 
Amendments 
are 
straightforward and make the bill even better. 
I believe they would command the support of 
a majority of the House and urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of them. 
The amendments are to the following divi-
sions: 
Division A—Department of State, Foreign 
Operations; 
Division B—Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration; and 
Division C—Department of the Interior, Envi-
ronment. 
DIVISION A—DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN 
OPERATIONS 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 11 will des-
ignate $1,000,000 to combat the trafficking of 
endangered species. 
My amendment makes a good bill better by 
providing a $1 million focus to combat the 
transportation of the remains of endangered 
species, to confront the transport of the re-
mains of killed endangered species. 
The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being 
lured off a protected preserve was an indica-
tion that we needed to do more to protect en-
dangered species at risk of being killed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3805 
July 23, 2020 
At that time, I introduced and sought the 
support of my colleagues as original cospon-
sors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endan-
gered and Threatened Species Act of 2015. 
This bill sought to strengthen partner coun-
tries’ capacity in countering wildlife trafficking 
and designating major wildlife countries for 
protection. 
The amendment offered is in the same spir-
it: to prohibit the taking and transportation of 
any endangered and threatened species as a 
trophy to the United States. 
Currently, the Endangered Species Act does 
not protect most wildlife animals killed. At this 
point, we can choose to make wise decisions 
that will sustain the global population, or we 
can ignore the warning signs. 
I believe this amendment is one that Mem-
bers can support because it would bring great-
er awareness and protection to these beautiful 
and vital populations that are too often taken 
for granted, by allowing this amendment to ad-
dress the senseless trafficking in trophy 
killings of all endangered and threatened spe-
cies. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 provides 
funds to be allocate funds provided for Global 
Health Programs to the fight against the prac-
tice of Female Genital Mutilation. 
I have been a dedicated champion against 
this practice for a long while, even working 
with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New 
York to introduce legislation targeted at sup-
porting the elimination of this ludicrous prac-
tice of mutilating young women. 
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) 
comprises all procedures that involve partial or 
total removal of the external female genitalia, 
or other injury to the female genital organs for 
non-medical reasons. 
This practice is rooted in gender inequality 
and is often linked to other elements of gen-
der-based violence and discrimination, such 
as child marriage and recognized internation-
ally as a violation of the human rights of 
women and girls. 
Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 
million girls and women alive today have been 
victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger 
representing 44 million of those who have 
been cut. 
For example, consider that: 
Around the world, at least five girls are 
mutilated/ cut every hour. 
More than 3 million girls are estimated to be 
at risk of FGM/C, annually. 
The impacts of FGM/C on the physical 
health of women and girls can include bleed-
ing, infection, obstetric fistula, complications 
during childbirth and death. 
Other significant barriers to combatting the 
practice of FGM/C include the high concentra-
tion in specific regions associated with several 
cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one 
religion. 
According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to 
occur in all parts of the world, but is most 
prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, 
and Asia. 
Due to the commonality of this practice 
many migrants to the U.S. bring the practice 
of FGM/C with them, increasing the impor-
tance of combatting FGM/C abroad. 
The United Nations adopted a set of 17 
Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 that 
includes a target to eliminate FGM/C and rec-
ognizing the abandonment of this harmful 
practice can be achieved because of a com-
prehensive movement that involves all public 
and private stakeholders in society. 
With these provisions in place and my 
amendment increasing the funding for foreign 
assistance we can ensure Female Genital Mu-
tilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally rec-
ognized violation of the human rights of girls 
and women comes to an end. 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) pub-
lished a report in 2016 estimating that 513,000 
women and girls in the United States were at 
risk or may have been subjected to FGM/C. 
The presence of FGM/C in the United 
States brings a sobering truth to light, that we 
still have much work to do here at home to 
stop our young women and girls from suffering 
at the hands of this archaic and utterly unnec-
essary practice. 
I am reminded of the story of Hadiatu 
Jalloh, a 7-year-old from Sierra Leone, who 
with her mother fled to Houston to seek a life 
saving operation to rectify complications from 
the practice of FGM/C from which she suf-
fered for more than a year. 
Due to complications from the FGM proce-
dure, little Hadiatu could not stop bleeding, 
she then underwent two additional nonmedical 
procedures to repair the damage she suffered. 
However, the bleeding continued and after 
the second procedure to stop the bleeding, 
Hadiatu could not properly urinate and suf-
fered terrible pain. 
In her desperate quest for help, Hadiatu’s 
mother Umu took her daughter across the bor-
der to Sierra Leone, but still could not find a 
doctor to treat Hadiatu. 
Dr. Hardwick-Smith a world-renowned board 
certified OBGYN—along with a team led by 
Houston pediatric urologist Dr. Eric Jones— 
solved Hadiatu’s problem by removing scar 
tissue during the successful surgery. 
Stories such like this remind me of the im-
portance of this work, and how can we cannot 
afford to ignore any instance of FGM/C. 
And that is why earlier we celebrated the 
International Day of Zero Tolerance for Fe-
male Genital Mutilation, a multinational effort 
to bring this practice to an end. 
That is why my amendment reprograms 
funding that will be used by the U.S. Agency 
for International Development (USAID) for 
elimination of FGM/C. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment increases 
funding to expedite the complete and total 
elimination of FGM/C. 
I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amend-
ment. 
DIVISION B—AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD 
AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 45 clarifies 
that nothing in the bill restricts the authority of 
the Secretary of Agriculture or any federal 
agency head from providing assistance and 
benefits to victims of trafficking as permitted 
by 22 U.S.C. 7105(b) of the Victims of Traf-
ficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 
(114 Stat. 1464, Pub. Law 106–386). 
Perpetrators of crime know that they are 
more likely to evade detection and punishment 
when their victims refuse to assist or cooper-
ate with law enforcement. That is why they 
make it a point to instill fear in their victims— 
for their own safety or that of family and loved 
ones. 
Human trafficking involves the use of force, 
fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor 
or commercial sex act. 
Every year, millions of men, women, and 
children are trafficked worldwide—including 
right here in the United States. 
It can happen in any community and victims 
can be any age, race, gender, or nationality. 
Traffickers might use violence, manipulation, 
or false promises of well-paying jobs or ro-
mantic relationships to lure victims into traf-
ficking situations. 
Language barriers, fear of their traffickers, 
and/ or fear of law enforcement frequently 
keep victims from seeking help, making 
human trafficking a hidden crime. 
They look for people who are susceptible for 
a variety of reasons, including psychological or 
emotional vulnerability, economic hardship, 
lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or 
political instability. 
The trauma caused by the traffickers can be 
so great that many may not identify them-
selves as victims or ask for help, even in high-
ly public settings. 
Recognizing key indicators of human traf-
ficking and providing support to victims so that 
traffickers are prosecuted is the first step in 
ending this crime. 
Victims are often alone and without re-
sources to survive outside of a trafficker’s con-
trol. 
Access to food programs is essential to es-
caping this terrible existence. 
I introduced this Jackson Lee amendment to 
provide food assistance to victims of human 
trafficking no matter who they are or where 
they may have come from. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 46 increases 
funding by $2,000,000 for the USDA agency 
that provides grant research funding for 
‘‘1890s Land Grant Universities,’’ which are 28 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 
The USDA’s National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture (NIFA) works to improve our na-
tion’s food production through agricultural re-
search, economic analysis, extension, and 
higher education. 
The NIFA was created at the time of the in-
dustrial revolution to ensure that the nation 
would have enough working farms to provide 
a reliable supply of domestically produced 
food. 
One of the ways NIFA achieves its mission 
is by providing research grants to education 
institutions, which include 1890s institutions 
created by the Morrill Act of 1890. 
Today, land-grant colleges and universities 
can be found in 18 states, the District of Co-
lumbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The list in-
cludes: 
Alabama A&M University, Alcorn State Uni-
versity, Delaware State University, Florida 
A&M University, Fort Valley State University, 
Kentucky State University, Langston Univer-
sity, Lincoln University, North Carolina A&T 
State University, Prairie View A&M University 
in Texas, South Carolina State University, 
Southern University System, Tennessee State 
University, Tuskegee University, University of 
Arkansas Pine Bluff, University of Maryland 
Eastern Shore, University of the District of Co-
lumbia, University of the Virgin Islands, Vir-
ginia State University, West Virginia State Uni-
versity. 
HBCUs annually enroll 40 percent of all Afri-
can American students in 4-year colleges and 
universities. 
HBCUs are prominent among research insti-
tutions in fields such as: animal sciences, sus-
tainable agriculture and agriculture economics, 
toxicology and waste management, conserva-
tion and environmental management, business 
and 
industrial 
development, 
biomedical

science, food and nutrition, plant and social 
sciences, international development. 
Research is essential to meeting the food 
needs of people not only in the United States 
but around the world. 
In the U.S. the demand for fresh fruits and 
vegetables as well as concerns for the dis-
tance food travels before, it reaches tables in 
urban areas has led to more research on how 
to improve urban farming. 
Another aspect of research is improving the 
shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables to slow 
the process of spoilage, which has proven to 
be one of the problems experienced during 
COVID–19 due to some disruptions caused by 
food supply chain difficulties. 
Extending shelf life of fresh fruits, and vege-
tables would also reduce food waste and im-
prove diets for people on limited incomes by 
making fresh items will be as economical as 
canned or frozen. 
HBCU agriculture research institutions are 
playing a role in bringing urban farming to 
communities of color. 
HCBU’s agricultural research programs also 
assist people living in densely populated areas 
to learn ways to eliminate food deserts, in-
crease public education regarding farming, de-
velop a greater appreciation for our nation’s 
farmers, and provide new avenues for careers 
for those graduating with agriculture degrees 
seeking to enter into cutting edge agricultural 
research. 
The funds provided by the Jackson Lee 
amendment would support research and edu-
cation into means for helping urban and sub-
urban communities maximize their green 
space by turning it into productive farming re-
sources to support access to affordable foods. 
The funding can also help to develop new 
research efforts directed at reducing food inse-
curity during a Pandemic or other crises that 
impact the availability or affordability of food. 
I ask for your support for these Jackson Lee 
Amendments. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of en bloc Amendment No. 1 which includes 
my amendments number 16 to the State and 
Foreign Operations division and number 123 
to the Military Construction and Veterans Af-
fairs division of the bill. 
The first of these would provide an addi-
tional $1.5 million for counterterrorisrn financ-
ing. Our nation is facing unprecedented inter-
national challenges including an out-of-control 
pandemic, a global economic slowdown due to 
the coronavirus, and stepped up efforts by au-
thoritarian governments to undermine demo-
cratic institutions both here and around the 
world. 
Unfortunately, these new trials do not dimin-
ish the importance of other critical long-
standing challenges we have been tackling, in-
cluding the threat of extremist groups and their 
terrorist tactics. Indeed, some groups have 
been 
trying 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic to bolster their agendas 
and attract more recruits. 
As Chairman of the Oversight National Se-
curity Subcommittee and Co-Chair of the Task 
Force on Terrorism and Proliferation Financ-
ing, I have seen how money is a lifeline for 
these groups. Cutting off financing is key to 
thwarting their efforts, and the best way to do 
that is by working with our allies. This addi-
tional funding will allow us to work even more 
closely with even more nations to starve these 
extremists of the capital they need to dissemi-
nate their agenda and carry out terror attacks. 
My second amendment, number 123, would 
provide an additional $1.5 million for veterans’ 
suicide prevention through the PREVENTS ini-
tiative. We are still seeing a suicide rate 
among our veterans that is unacceptably and 
tragically high at one-and-a-half times that of 
civilians. with women veterans twice as likely 
to die by suicide as their civilian counterparts. 
I chaired a National Security Subcommittee 
hearing last May examining veteran and ac-
tive-duty military suicides, as well as efforts by 
the Department of Defense ( DOD) and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to combat 
this problem. The testimony highlighted the 
need for comprehensive solutions that span 
the DOD and the VA, with a focus on high 
quality healthcare, provider training and edu-
cation, and access to services and resources. 
Both the DOD and VA have made signifi-
cant efforts to provide more services and out-
reach 
to 
prevent 
suicides 
among 
our 
servicemembers and veterans, but there is al-
ways much more that can be done. This addi-
tional funding will support public-private part-
nerships designed to provide greater access 
to the vital help that can save the lives of our 
brave men and women after they leave the 
military. 
I would like to thank Appropriations Com-
mittee Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking mem-
ber GRANGER for including these amendments 
in this en bloc.

ant to House Resolution 1060, the pre-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) 
and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
GRANGER) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), the co-chair 
of the DPCC. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the wonderful chair of the Appropria-
tions Committee for yielding. 
I rise in support of en bloc 2, which 
includes an important amendment to 
block the Trump administration’s lat-
est attack on the National Environ-
mental Policy Act. 
For 50 years, NEPA has both pro-
tected and fought for the environment 
and empowered local communities pro-
tecting them. In many cases, NEPA 
provides ordinary Americans the only 
opportunity to have a voice on major 
projects, including pipelines or extrac-
tive activity like oil and gas drilling 
that directly impacts their commu-
nities. 
The administration’s new NEPA rule 
both limits the scope of environmental 
review and exempts entire categories 
of projects from review all together. 
Mr. Speaker, the administration’s at-
tack on NEPA prioritizes special inter-
ests and polluters ahead of the Amer-
ican people and our environmental her-
itage. I urge my colleagues to support 
this en bloc amendment and to block 
this assault on one of our Nation’s bed-
rock environmental laws. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this group of partisan, 
antiresource development amendments 
offered by several House Democrats. 
These provisions offered on the Interior 
appropriations bill will hamstring our 
Nation’s efforts to secure our energy 
independence. 
Many of these amendments seek to 
prohibit oil and gas development, and, 
Mr. Speaker, I have just got to say, it 
is really quite ironic to see my col-
leagues who just yesterday voted for 
sweeping legislation mandating $900 
million a year from the oil and gas in-
dustry for conservation projects to 
now, just one day later, not even 24 
hours later, offer amendments to re-
strict the very industry that those 
projects depend upon. 
This is hypocrisy, plain and simple. 
But it is exactly what I shared in a 
message with my constituents yester-
day. Democrats are trying to have 
their cake and eat it too. From the 
Green New Deal to Mr. Biden’s energy 
plan to these irresponsible amend-
ments we have here before us, Demo-
crats continue to put forward ideas 
that are not based in reality and will 
harm our Nation’s energy security. 
Another partisan amendment seeks 
to block the recent finalized rule by 
the Council on Environmental Quality 
to modernize severely outdated and 
burdensome National Environmental 
Policy Act regulations, something that 
has not been done for 40 years. 
According to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce’s Unlock American Invest-
ment coalition, we are now seeing in-
frastructure project delays of up to 20 
years across our country. This is unac-
ceptable, and it prevents critical re-
pairs and construction of roads, of 
bridges, of airports, railways, renew-
able energy projects, even water infra-
structure projects in the West and 
many more things. 
At a time when American jobs and 
the economy are facing significant 
challenges, these provisions threaten 
our Nation’s resiliency, our energy 
independence, and our ability to re-
cover from this pandemic. 
Please, Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘no’’ on 
these amendments. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and for her incredible leadership. 
I rise in support of this package, 
which contains two amendments I have 
introduced. 
My first amendment addresses the 
harmful algal blooms impacting many 
north Jersey lakes and harming our 
ecotourism, local businesses, and resi-
dents. We need the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey to report to Congress on ways to 
combat toxic HABs like those in 
Greenwood Lake and Lake Hopatcong. 
My second amendment prohibits any 
funds in the bill being used to promote 
the sale of vaping and dangerous e-cig-
arette products, which can harm our 
children. We must do everything we 
can to help save lives and protect fami-
lies by combating the youth vaping 
epidemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
set of amendments. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member from Texas (Ms. 
GRANGER) for yielding. 
This amendment would increase, by 
100,000, the funding to combat the prev-
alence of female genital mutilation, 
FGM, around the world. 
FGM represents a grave moral evil, 
irreparably compromising the health 
and well-being of every woman and girl 
subjected to it. 
The practice of FGM occurs in 30 
countries, in particular, Egypt, Indo-
nesia, and Ethiopia, and has been per-
formed on more than 200 million 
women and girls to date. Every year, 3 
million more girls are placed at risk, 
with most of the victims below the age 
of 15. 
The long-term effects of FGM are 
wide ranging, including post-traumatic 
stress disorder, depression, flashbacks, 
self-harm, and severe difficulties dur-
ing labor. 
In February, an Egyptian doctor was 
arrested for performing FGM on a 12- 
year-old girl, resulting in her death, at 
the instruction of the girl’s parents. 
The doctor conducted the practice 
without any anesthesia and without 
having the appropriate surgeon quali-
fications. 
To be clear, this is not an isolated 
case. 
Egypt has banned the practice of 
FGM since 2008 and criminalized it in 
2016. The fact that it still happens to 
an overwhelming number of young 
girls in that country, despite the strict 
legal measures, illustrates the massive 
scope of this problem and the immense 
work remaining for each of us. 
The U.S. must be unequivocal in con-
demning this disgusting, horrific prac-
tice and lead the world in calling for it 
to end, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. FOSTER.)

July 23, 2020 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
My amendment directs the State De-
partment to use $10 million from the 
NADR account to fund a major science 
facility in Jordan called SESAME, or 
the 
Synchrotron-light 
for 
Experi-
mental Science and Application in the 
Middle East. SESAME is a cooperative 
venture by scientists and governments 
throughout 
the 
region, 
including 
Israel, Iran, and everyone in between. 
Science is a universal language that 
can cross barriers, and SESAME has 
the potential to be that bridge in an 
area where very few exist. The U.S. 
support would strengthen collaboration 
and provide encouragement for all of 
the countries in the region. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this en bloc package. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, before I 
introduce the next speaker, I just want 
to say a few words about SESAME, be-
cause it is an extraordinary project, 
and I thank the gentleman for bringing 
it to this body’s attention. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
b 1600 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman LOWEY for yielding. I appre-
ciate the opportunity to speak. 
In this en bloc amendment, there are 
four amendments that I offered. I have 
offered them for 4 years. They have 
been accepted, now, for 2 years. They 
are emoluments amendments. They 
will say we can’t spend money at busi-
nesses that the President owns. 
Well, we shouldn’t. No President 
should be in the business of getting 
money from the government, and it 
wasn’t until Donald Trump became 
President that this became a problem. 
He does it at his hotels. He does it at 
his golf clubs. He has done it having 
airplanes stop at different airports 
than they normally do for refueling so 
they will end up having to spend the 
night at his golf club in Scotland. And 
recently, it came up that he asked his 
Ambassador to England to get one of 
his golf clubs in Scotland the oppor-
tunity to host the British Open and 
make a ton of money. 
The Presidency should be about serv-
ing the country and serving the people 
and supporting democracy, not about 
supporting yourself and putting money 
in your pocket. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on this en bloc package, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I thank the gentlewoman 
for her generosity and for recognizing 
the importance of the work that we are 
doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to my 
amendments and thank the Rules Com-
mittee for these amendments. I guess I 
have to speak very quickly. 
We have been committed over the 
years to stopping the trafficking of en-
dangered species, and I am glad that I 
have established a focus on protecting 
the endangered species like Cecil the 
lion. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules Com-
mittee for that amendment, as well as 
the amendment that I have been work-
ing on for many years to stop female 
genital mutilation, to highlight the ex-
tensive amount of mutilation in devel-
oping nations across the world. 
I was also very pleased to have an 
amendment that provided for the au-
thority of the Secretary of Agriculture 
or any Federal agency, to stop them 
from eliminating assistance and bene-
fits to victims of trafficking as per-
mitted by 22 U.S.C. 7105. 
We know that victims of human traf-
ficking are the most vulnerable, and 
my city of Houston has been the epi-
center of human trafficking. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to also applaud the fact that I 
was able to get an amendment in that 
increases the funding by $2 million, 
through the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture, for the 1890s land-grant col-
leges, which are 28 historically Black 
colleges. It helps those who are in food 
deserts. 
And, Mr. Speaker, my district has 
now some percentage of COVID–19 who 
are, in essence, underwater, suffering, 
and food distribution, or the lack of 
food, is very evident. 
We have suffered in my region with 
toxic poisoning from chemicals, and we 
now have $5 million that has been in 
the Department of the Interior to high-
light the need to support culturally 
competent Federal, State, and local 
public health and environmental pro-
tection efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Fifth 
Ward Texas that they have been heard 
in the Halls of the United States Con-
gress; they will not any longer be con-
taminated by creosote and having the 
numbers of cancers that they have ex-
perienced, as I have knocked on doors 
and had people telling me about their 
families dying because the railroad’s 
creosote contaminated their backyards 
and the trees that they grew and the 
fruit that they grew. 
How horrendous that we would have 
that. 
I am very glad that our amendments 
were included in this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
chairwoman has been enormously gra-
cious for me to be able to conclude my 
remarks by indicating again the impor-
tance of the historically Black colleges 
getting an extra $2 million; empha-
sizing that Fifth Ward Texas, the home 
of Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, 
older neighborhoods in the historically 
minority communities, won’t suffer 
any longer by toxic poisoning because 
of chemicals that have been placed 
without care; and to be able to thank 
them, as well, for taking care of the en-
dangered species and those who are 
trafficked and those, as well, with fe-
male genital mutilation. 
Mr. Speaker, I close my remarks by 
simply saying the COVID–19 dollars are 
needed. I thank the chairwoman for 
that. We are suffering in Houston, and 
we are going to fight to stop commu-
nity spread by more testing, more test-
ing, more testing. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CARBAJAL). 
Mr. 
CARBAJAL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Chairwoman LOWEY for yielding 
to me. 
I rise in support of an amendment 
that includes a provision I coauthored 
with Representative PANETTA to send a 
clear message to this administration 
that our public lands are not for sale. 
We will not put the interests of Big 
Oil over our people and sit idly by as 
the Trump administration seeks to 
open up the Carrizo Plain National 
Monument and other public lands in 
my district for oil and gas develop-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, my amend-
ment will direct $4,000,000 within the Inter-
national Border and Water Commission to 
clarify the responsibility for the maintenance of 
the International Outfall Interceptor (IOI). This 
is in addition to, and separate from, the fund-
ing that currently exists for the long overdue 
repairs to the IOI. 
The International Outfall Interceptor is the 
infrastructure that transports wastewater from 
Sonora, Mexico and Arizona to the Nogales 
International Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
The IOI pipeline covers approximately 8.5 
miles. Under a 1944 water utilization treaty, 
Mexico can treat water in the United States. 
The International Border and Water Commis-
sion is tasked with managing international in-
frastructure negotiations and operates the 
Nogales International Sanitation Project. 
On average, 92 percent of the water treated 
daily at the Nogales International Wastewater 
Treatment Plant is from Mexico and 8 percent 
from the surrounding community. 
Unfortunately, due to damage and aging in-
frastructure, the International Outfall Inter-
ceptor needs costly and urgent repairs. 
Wastewater constantly emerges from the IOI 
and pollutes surrounding rivers and streams. 
Rains carry the polluted stormwater into 
Nogales, Arizona and exposes downstream 
populations to extraordinary public health risk. 
In 2017, I called on the Governor of Arizona 
to commence the Disaster Declaration process 
for the State of Arizona to secure immediate 
federal assistance to remedy and prevent raw 
sewage exposure to Arizona residents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3817 
July 23, 2020 
Every year during the monsoon season the 
health of residents along the Arizona southern 
border are put at risk, due to this ongoing 
issue. While Arizona residents are very famil-
iar with this issue, other communities along 
the United States-Mexico border experience 
similar health risks due to similar issues. 
The IBWC has finalized engineering plans 
and already identified an existing $34.2 million 
to begin the urgent repairs to the IOI. My 
amendment further directs $4,000,000 within 
the International Border and Water Commis-
sion to clarify the responsibility to sustain the 
maintenance and operation of the International 
Outfall Interceptor (IOI). 
This has been an ongoing international 
issue that impacts the safety and well-being of 
communities across Southern Arizona. In the 
past, Senators and Member of Congress on 
both sides of the aisle of the Arizona delega-
tion have collaborated to remedy the situation. 
I would like to thank Senator MCSALLY for 
championing this issue in the Senate. 
I would like to thank the Chairwoman and 
the committee for their work on this bill. I ap-
preciate the opportunity to speak on this 
amendment, and I would urge all my col-
leagues to support this amendment. We must 
finally find a solution to protect the health of 
residents along the United States-Mexico bor-
der. 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to advocate for amendment No. 33 to 
H.R. 7608, the Department of State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Appropria-
tions Act for Fiscal Year 2021. My colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle have come together 
to support this amendment, which should ap-
propriate $1.4 million in foreign aid for ongoing 
humanitarian 
demining 
in 
Nagorno 
Karabakh—Artsakh. 
USAID’s demining program has eliminated 
nearly 4,000 landmines and over 57,000 items 
of unexploded ordnance, saving many lives 
from these remnants of war. The program has 
also transformed over 62,000 acres of former 
minefield and battlefield into land that can be 
used productively. 
However, we know that significant landmine 
contamination remains. Nagomo Karabakh 
has suffered from one of the worst mine acci-
dent rates in the world, with nearly 400 civilian 
casualties since 1994—a quarter of which 
have been children. Just last month an 11- 
year old boy named Hovannes found a sub-
munition while digging in his family’s garden. 
Because Hovannes had received U.S.-funded 
mine risk education about how to identify the 
weapon and stay safe, he told his family about 
the item, who contacted the U.S. demining 
program. The submunition was safely re-
moved the next day. 
Continued funding for the demining program 
will unquestionably save lives and generate 
peace and stability in the region. The United 
States’ 
demining 
program 
in 
Nagomo 
Karabakh represents the only source of U.S. 
support in the region, and the only demining 
assistance 
available 
to 
the 
families 
of 
Karabakh. Without an appropriation of $1.4 
million, the U.S. demining program will close, 
and families in the region, who are still waiting 
for their land to be made safe, will suffer in-
definitely—families that are of utmost impor-
tance to the many Armenian American com-
munities in my district and throughout our na-
tion. 
Landmine clearance is a bipartisan U.S. pri-
ority that will provide critical humanitarian relief 
to countless families in Nagomo Karabakh 
who continue to live in constant threat of dan-
ger. I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and help provide much needed 
stability to this region, while continuing to sup-
port a constructive relationship between the 
U.S., Nagomo Karabakh, and Armenia. 
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of my amendment to H.R. 7608, which high-
lights the contributions of Vietnamese, Laotian, 
and Cambodian immigrants and discourages 
attempts to increase repatriations to those 
countries. 
In 2008, the United States reached a formal 
agreement with Vietnam which contains spe-
cific restrictions on the repatriation of certain 
individuals to Vietnam. Under this agreement, 
any Vietnamese national who arrived in the 
United States before our two nations estab-
lished formal diplomatic relations on July 12, 
1995 is barred from being repatriated to Viet-
nam. This provision benefits our communities 
by keeping families together and allowing peo-
ple who have lived here for decades to con-
tinue making a positive impact on their com-
munities. Under this Administration, there has 
been a renewed push to increase deportations 
to Southeast Asian countries, including the 
weaponization of visa sanctions to unilaterally 
push for broadened repatriation agreements. 
I am proud to represent a community where 
we honor the thousands of men, women, and 
children who arrived in the United States after 
the Vietnam War in search of a better life, and 
I call upon this Administration to cease at-
tempts to renegotiate repatriation agreements 
to allow for greater numbers of repatriations to 
these countries. 
I would like to thank Chairwoman LOWEY 
and the House Committee on Appropriations 
for including report language we requested to 
prevent the use of funds to negotiate or enter 
into an agreement with the Governments of 
Laos or Vietnam for the repatriation of these 
individuals. I also would like to thank my col-
leagues, Representatives ALAN LOWENTHAL, 
LOU CORREA, and ZOE LOFGREN, for their sup-
port of this amendment and their continued 
hard work on behalf of Vietnamese and South-
east Asian American communities. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in strong support of Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 84 to H.R. 7608, the State, 
Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Rural Devel-
opment, Interior, Environment, Military Con-
struction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations 
Act. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking 
Member COLE for making this Jackson Lee 
amendment in order for House consideration 
of H.R. 7608. 
This Jackson Lee Amendment is straight-
forward and makes the bill even better. I be-
lieve they would command the support of a 
majority of the House and urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor of them. 
The amendment is to Division C—Depart-
ment of the Interior, Environment. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 84 provides 
$5 million to highlight the need to support cul-
turally competent federal, state, and local pub-
lic health and environmental protection efforts 
to address cancer clusters impacting overbur-
dened communities in the gulf coast region, 
which is home to a refinery row that runs from 
Mobile to Houston Texas. 
In the 18th Congressional District Creosote 
contamination in my district has had long term 
consequences for the residents of the 5th 
Ward. 
I have worked for years to address Environ-
mental Justice issues in and around my Dis-
trict, by bringing agencies and communities to-
gether for meaningful dialogues. 
In April of 2019, I held a meeting between 
residents, local public health and Union Pacific 
Railroad regarding contamination in the 5th 
Ward area of Houston. Predecessor R.R. was 
South Pacific 
The meeting was to discuss letters that 
Union Pacific sent to residents informing them 
that they could not dig water wells in their 
yards due to creosote contamination. 
During this meeting residents expressed 
frustration at not getting questions answered 
regarding their concerns about the safety of 
water and soil due to the contamination and 
the alarming number of cancers occurring 
among residents. 
After hearing the discussion, I asked about 
a study to investigate the situation and provide 
answers to residents. 
A cancer cluster study was performed by 
the Texas Department of State Health Serv-
ices and found that there is a higher incidence 
of certain types of cancers and cancer deaths 
among residents of Kashmere Gardens and 
the Fifth Ward. 
Southern Pacific operated the open pit of 
creosote in the residential area that treated 
railroad ties and light post for decades. 
Southern Pacific was acquired by Union Pa-
cific, which continued to operate a wood treat-
ment facility, dipping railroad ties in the pre-
servative creosote. 
The creosote emitted fumes, leached into 
the soil and ran through ditches when it rained 
or flooded. 
Union Pacific closed their creosote treat-
ment capacity, but the damage remained, be-
cause creosote is comprised of chemicals that 
in combination are listed as a hazardous sub-
stance by the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy. 
To address the contamination Union Pacific 
requested and approved largely to leave the 
contamination in the ground without pursuing 
more extensive cleanup efforts, which has left 
residents battling to get regulators to force the 
company to take more responsibility for the 
thick mass of creosote that lurks beneath their 
properties. 
These residents are right—the soil and 
water are killing them with cancer and Union 
Pacific has got to take strong action to remove 
this clear health threat that is causing cancers 
of the: 
Lung and Bronchus; 
Esophagus; 
Larynx (throat); 
Liver; and 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia. 
Rare is the case that a community meeting 
results in such a profound finding that and ex-
posed an urgent need that should be ad-
dressed given the science behind the causes 
of cancer and the steps that much be taken to 
limit risks. 
There are other communities throughout the 
Gulf Coast that may have creosote contamina-
tion linked to old railroad lines that may not be 
given the level of attention needed to address 
health risks. 
Funding provided by this amendment will 
provide resources for those communities with 
cancer clusters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3818 
July 23, 2020 
I ask for your support for this Jackson Lee 
Amendment, which is needed to save lives. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of en bloc Amendment No. 2 which includes 
my amendment number 17 to the State and 
Foreign Operations division to provide an ad-
ditional $5 million for U.S. demining activities. 
Mr. Speaker, antipersonnel landmines con-
tinue to injure and kill thousands of men. 
women. and children every year. These de-
vices arc indiscriminate and can explode years 
or even decades after wars are ended and 
peace agreements are signed. All it takes is 
for a car to pass or a person to walk over the 
wrong place at the wrong time to devastate a 
life and a family. 
Thankfully, there are a number of humani-
tarian organizations that arc working tirelessly 
to find and safely remove these explosives. 
Unfortunately, despite their valiant efforts, 
there still remain many more antipersonnel 
landmines to be found and neutralized. I have 
had the opportunity to examine the impact of 
landmines in places like Lebanon, Somalia 
and Egypt, and believe that the United States 
has a moral obligation to do all it can to sup-
port demining efforts, and that is why I sought 
this increase. 
I was proud to work with the Appropriations 
Committee in 2006 to get an increase of $10 
million to the State Department’s Humanitarian 
Demining account and am grateful that it has 
accepted my amendment for an increase of $5 
million to this year’s appropriations bill. This 
additional funding will save countless more 
lives and spare thousands from having to live 
with devastating injuries.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

tlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) 
and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
GRANGER) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER), the ranking 
member, for yielding. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to enhance conditions on our aid 
to the Lebanese Armed Forces, LAF. 
Mr. Speaker, Lebanon has histori-
cally been an appreciated partner of 
the United States in the Middle East 
and a wonderful example of pluralism 
and democracy. 
Having witnessed decades of occupa-
tion by the brutal Assad regime in 
Syria, father and son, Lebanon saw the 
withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005 
after the Lebanese people rose up in 
the March 15 Cedar Revolution to de-
mand their sovereignty and freedom. 
Unfortunately, however, the gains 
made by the Cedar Revolution have 
been lost in recent years. The Lebanese 
people continue to protest in the 
streets for their rights to a democratic, 
nonsectarian, noncorrupt government. 
However, disturbingly, the LAF have 
worked to put down the protests, ar-
resting 
protesters 
and 
committing 
human rights violations. 
The LAF has also done nothing as 
Hezbollah builds precision-guided mis-
siles and cross-border tunnel infra-
structure to attack Israel in defiance 
of U.S. resolutions; yet, U.S. taxpayers 
continue to fund the LAF with over 
$100 million each year. 
This aid was surely warranted in pre-
vious years during previous Lebanese 
Governments, but with the new govern-
ment, the situation has changed, and 
U.S. policies should change accord-
ingly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3819 
July 23, 2020 
It is time to stand with the people of 
Lebanon and Syria and ensure that 
U.S. tax dollars are not going to a mili-
tary hijacked by a terrorist organiza-
tion and committing human rights vio-
lations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I claim time in opposition. 
There are many things in this en bloc 
that I oppose, and I could speak to each 
issue, but I want to reserve my com-
ments 
for 
the 
attack 
on 
climate 
change. 
Most of us, even my friends across 
the aisle, agree that climate change is 
a real global threat. Our military also 
believes this. 
I cannot emphasize enough that cli-
mate change is exacerbating the root 
causes of conflict. We will see an in-
creasing demand on our humanitarian 
aid and other resources if we do not ad-
dress it now. 
Prohibiting U.S. contributions to the 
multilaterals 
that 
combat 
climate 
change is a shortsighted, harmful pol-
icy that does not prepare our country 
to face this threat. 
We cannot afford to stand idly by 
while others address climate change. 
We already feel its effects. We should 
not be alienating multilateral part-
ners. We need to join the fight. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
GRANGER) for yielding and for all her 
hard work on the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
en bloc package. I particularly want to 
highlight my two amendments, both of 
which protect integral Trump adminis-
tration executive orders. 
The first protects Executive Order 
13807, which pertains to streamlining 
environmental review and permitting 
processes for infrastructure projects. 
This executive order was the basis for 
new NEPA regulations that the Trump 
administration announced just last 
week. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to get back to 
building things in this country. It 
seems every week is like groundhog 
week, it is infrastructure week, but if 
we are serious about addressing the 
problems with our aging infrastruc-
ture, we must get serious about mod-
ernizing outdated processes that un-
necessarily slow down infrastructure 
projects. 
Whether it is offshore wind, building 
electrical transition lines, or building 
solar energy projects on public lands, 
outdated regulations cause countless 
delays and cancellations of these im-
portant projects, costing jobs and eco-
nomic opportunity for our constitu-
ents. 
My second amendment protects Exec-
utive Order 13817, which directs the 
Federal Government to develop a strat-
egy to ensure a secure and reliable sup-
ply of critical minerals. 
The facts are, Mr. Speaker, that we 
are completely reliant on China for 20 
critical minerals that go into pro-
ducing everything from parts for fight-
er jets to cellphones. 
Cobalt is a great example of the dan-
gers of becoming reliant on China to 
meet these mineral needs. Sixty per-
cent of the cobalt supply is mined in 
the Congo, where abhorrent child labor 
practices are well documented, and 
China now controls at least half of all 
cobalt production in that country. 
Fortunately, the proposed Twin Met-
als mine would serve as a rare source of 
domestic cobalt, but, of course, my col-
leagues aim to shut that project down 
as well by including language in this 
bill aimed at preventing this project. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
wake up and face the facts. We must 
harvest our own domestic resources 
and ingenuity before it is too late. Our 
long-term economic, energy, and na-
tional security depend upon it, even 
the climate change the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) talked 
about. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman LOWEY for yielding. 
I rise today to offer an amendment to 
prohibit funds from being used to open 
up new Federal lands to oil and gas 
drilling in my and my neighboring dis-
trict on the central coast of California. 
Based on recent orders, this adminis-
tration would use those Federal lands 
to extract natural resources rather 
than explore their natural wonders. 
In my district, our economy and 
well-being are intrinsically tied to our 
environment. That is why we have 
taken critical steps to invest in clean 
infrastructure rather than new leases 
for fossil fuels. That is because we feel 
strongly that our public lands are not 
disposable and should not be disrupted. 
That is why I offered this amend-
ment, and that is why I will continue 
to fight to safeguard our Federal public 
lands. 
b 1615 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
(Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support 
of 
my 
amendment 
which 
strikes harmful language in the under-
lying bill that would prevent any fund-
ing to be used by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service to process permits for 
lawfully sport-hunted trophies from 
the countries of Tanzania, Zimbabwe, 
or Zambia. 
Sportsmen groups and conservation 
groups, both here at home in America 
and internationally, all agree that 
well-regulated hunting in the countries 
affected by the shortsighted language 
found in section 436 of the underlying 
bill, is just reckless pandering to spe-
cial-interest animal rights groups. 
The irony is this language will have 
an adverse effect and hurt populations 
of the remaining wild lions and ele-
phants which these emotionally driven, 
science deniers claim to be advocating 
for. 
But what about those who live and 
work in the countries affected by this 
legislation? How do they feel about 
this 
Congress 
mindlessly 
targeting 
their livelihoods? 
Well, it may come as a great shock to 
those on the other side of the aisle, but 
just this week a letter was sent to the 
Speaker of the House by local rep-
resentatives of millions of rural Afri-
cans who object to this attack on their 
basic human right to sustainably use 
their natural resources on which their 
communities’ livelihoods depend. 
They understand, better than the 
folks here in this body, that sustain-
able hunting practices which they uti-
lize lead not only to benefits for their 
wildlife populations and their eco-
systems, but to the betterment of their 
fellow man and their communities. 
In many cases, the population of 
these species exceed the carrying ca-
pacity 
of 
their 
habitats. 
If 
left 
unmanaged, they threaten the viable 
habitats as well as the safety of hu-
mans in these rural areas. 
Experts, 
including 
scientific 
and 
management authorities in those coun-
tries, the parties to the Convention on 
International 
Trade 
in 
Endangered 
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the 
International Union for Conservation 
of Nature, and the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service, credit sustainable hunting 
programs as a cornerstone of the suc-
cessful conservation and wildlife man-
agement strategies that are responsible 
for these wildlife populations. Any law 
that discourages, rather than facili-
tates, these hunting programs will 
have an adverse impact on sound eco-
system conservation. 
The language, which this amendment 
will strike, is not backed by science. 
To the contrary, the best conservation 
science clearly shows that populations 
of lions and elephants in the affected 
countries are some of the highest found 
anywhere on the entire continent. 
Mr. Speaker, it is for these reasons I 
urge adoption of this amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), the chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take a 
moment to address Congresswoman 
MILLER
and 
Congressman 
KING’s 
amendments in the en bloc. Their 
amendments would strike provisions of 
the bill that block the administration 
from diverting funds from critical mili-
tary construction projects to the bor-
der wall.

The bill also prohibits the adminis-
tration from backfilling projects in fis-
cal years 2016 to 2020 that were pre-
viously canceled for construction of 
the border wall, and the amendments 
strike that provision as well. 
Stealing military construction funds 
from the intended purpose has a direct 
impact on military readiness, com-
promises our national security, and the 
safety and welfare of servicemembers 
and their families. 
Thirty percent of the Department of 
Defense infrastructure, according to 
the Department of Defense, is in poor 
or failing condition. The military con-
struction funds provided and approved 
by Congress were intended for specific 
projects as requested by the services. 
To support these two amendments is 
to declare that catering to xenophobia 
is more important than making sure 
we have the best fighting force in the 
world. 
The amendments in question seek to 
grant the President the power of a 
monarch and allow him to steal fund-
ing from our troops and bypass Con-
gress at will. 
I thought Mexico was supposed to 
pay for the border wall. Instead, these 
amendments ask our heroes in uniform 
to pay for it. We have to take a stand 
against that, and we do that in this 
bill. 
We stand up for our troops. These 
amendments steal from our troops. I 
ask my colleagues to vote against the 
en bloc amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from West Virginia (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in favor of three amend-
ments I have submitted in the Repub-
lican en bloc. 
An amendment to stop my colleagues 
across the aisle from cutting funding 
for our border wall. We still have a cri-
sis on our southern border, and we need 
to stop illegal drugs from entering our 
country. 
An amendment to support innovation 
in the gas industry. American energy is 
clean, affordable, and efficient. We 
must capitalize on our American en-
ergy dominance to rebuild our econ-
omy, expand trade, and create stable 
jobs. 
And an amendment to make sure our 
police remain funded. We cannot let 
our liberal colleagues defund the po-
lice. This overcorrection will lead our 
country to a dark place. Our police of-
ficers protect our communities and 
keep us safe. I am proud to support our 
police. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). Welcome to 
her children, too. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment, 
which increases funds for lead drinking 
water pipe replacement by $500 million, 
to a total of $1 billion. 
This amendment is an investment to 
remove the 6 to 10 million lead service 
lines that contaminate our tap water 
across our Nation, and the over 600,000 
lines alone in Michigan. 
Contaminated water is a fact of life 
for Michigan’s 13th Congressional Dis-
trict. Too many of our families and 
communities are suffering, and it is 
time we step up our investments to 
guarantee environmental justice for 
all. 
I thank Chairwoman MCCOLLUM for 
working with me on this amendment to 
secure historic funding to replace lead 
pipes. And I also thank my colleagues, 
Representatives KILDEE
and SLOTKIN 
for their partnership on this. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of Representative 
DUNCAN’s amendment to strike from 
the bill section 436, which prohibits the 
issuance of an import permit for a 
sport-hunted trophy of an elephant or 
lion taken in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, or 
Zambia. 
Simply put, this import prohibition 
would harm the economic development 
of African countries and put the wild-
life and habitat in those countries at 
risk. 
This is exactly what the Zambian 
Foreign Minister told me when I met 
with him: 
Regulated, sustainable hunting can 
be used for economic development just 
like any other natural resource. And in 
the vast majority of instances, hunting 
revenue and game fees are the greatest 
and most accessible asset for rural peo-
ple. 
By creating a market for regulated 
hunting of these animals, African 
countries promote conservation and 
undermine incentives for illegal poach-
ing. 
A U.S. import ban undermines those 
markets in African countries, which 
perpetuates 
unsustainable 
poaching, 
underground markets, poverty, and 
economic underdevelopment. 
The individuals who seek to prevent 
African 
countries 
from 
responsibly 
using their natural resources are the 
same who strive to end the production 
of agriculture in States like North Da-
kota. 
They impart a flawed moral view on 
others without understanding the eco-
nomic and cultural ramifications that 
harm the communities that produce 
these resources. It is paternalistic and, 
quite frankly, it is condescending and, 
in fact, counterproductive to a robust 
conservation of the magnificent ani-
mals and the habitat in which those 
animals live. 
Hunters and sportsmen are truly the 
world’s best conservationists, and the 
resources we deploy go toward anti- 
poaching programs; defend against de-
struction 
of 
vital 
habitat; 
and 
incentivize local communities to come 
together to protect their wildlife. 
I urge the adoption of the Duncan 
amendment, which will promote sus-
tainable hunting markets with African 
countries. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
the 
ranking 
member, 
Ms. 
GRANGER from Texas. 
I have three amendments included in 
this en bloc amendment. 
The first one prohibits any funds in 
the State and Foreign Ops Division 
from being provided to the United Na-
tions 
Relief 
and 
Works 
Agency, 
UNRWA. 
In 2018, President Trump made the 
correct decision to defund UNRWA. Un-
fortunately, this bill seeks to reverse 
course and provide funding to this or-
ganization. 
I remind everybody, this organiza-
tion, rather than pursuing its mission, 
chooses to foster and promote and anti- 
Semitism and violence against Israelis. 
In spite of repeated demands by the 
U.S., UNRWA continues this kind of 
abhorrent behavior. 
The second amendment prohibits the 
EPA from using funds in this bill to 
take retaliatory actions against States 
that fall short of the EPA-mandated 
Chesapeake Bay TMDL. 
In 2010, the EPA seized the States’ 
authority 
to 
determine 
their 
own 
method of compliance and threatened 
to take over the water quality plans if 
the States failed to comply. 
These coercive measures have been 
tried and have failed. Water quality 
has not improved since the federaliza-
tion of the Bay clean-up efforts. Pre-
venting EPA from taking retaliatory 
action is imperative to the success of 
these efforts. 
The final one prohibits the EPA from 
using funds pursuant to Section 115 of 
the Clean Air Act. 
Section 115 of the Clean Air Act al-
lows the EPA to mandate State emis-
sions levels to whatever level the agen-
cy deems appropriate: if they find 
emissions endanger a foreign nation; 
and the endangered nation has a recip-
rocal agreement to prevent or control 
these emissions in their own nation. 
I urge adoption of these amendments. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, on the last day of the Obama- 
Biden administration, Fish and Wild-
life issued a ‘‘Director’s Order’’ setting 
in place an almost total ban on lead 
ammunition and tackle on Federal 
lands. 
While Fish and Wildlife claimed that 
the rule was based on science, we know 
clearly it was not. The decision by the 
Obama-Biden administration was made 
solely to limit access to public land of 
sportsmen and fishermen. 
As soon as I was made aware of this 
midnight rule, I worked with the in-
coming Trump administration to get it 
overturned. 
Fortunately,

July 23, 2020 
Trump acted quickly to undo this dis-
astrous order. And since then he has 
only taken steps to increase access to 
public lands for sportsmen and fisher-
men alike. 
Since 
President 
Trump’s 
actions, 
Congress has taken additional steps to 
prevent the regulation of ammunition 
and tackle for sportsmen. Unfortu-
nately, Democrats have decided to 
abandon the precedent. 
My amendment simply reinstates a 
policy that Congress has carried in a 
bipartisan fashion for the past several 
years and continues support for the 
rights of sportsmen to access public 
land for recreational purposes. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt the 
amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. KING). 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment. 
What it does is, it sees that in the un-
derlying legislation there is language 
that strikes the President’s ability to 
use the resources within the Depart-
ment of Defense budget to build a wall 
or a road along the southern border. It 
would be a mistake to take that lan-
guage out and—to have that language 
in there. We need to take the language 
out and let the President have the dis-
cretion to make these decisions. He has 
a mandate from the American people. 
The southern border is such a risk 
that 80 to 90 percent of the illegal 
drugs coming through into the United 
States come from or through Mexico; 
70,000 drug overdose deaths; the vio-
lence that comes from it; tens of mil-
lions of illegal aliens in America, and 
we have seen unemployment numbers 
in this country as high as 40 million 
throughout this COVID epidemic. 
So to tie the President’s hands and to 
take away the resources he has in front 
of him now, because it essentially says, 
no funds heretofore appropriated may 
be used either for a wall or a road. 
I would say also that I came to this 
floor and from this very podium in 2006 
with a model that demonstrated how 
easy it was to build a wall on the 
southern border. It is cost effective, 
and it preserves our security. This 
amendment gives the President back 
the authority to continue the construc-
tion of the wall. 
Madam Speaker, I urge its adoption. 
b 1630 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ). Pursuant to House 
Resolution 1060, the previous question 
is ordered on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. LOWEY). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

AMENDMENT NO. 62 OFFERED BY MR. ALLEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 62 
printed in House Report 116–459. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division C (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. lll. Each amount made available 
by this Act (other than an amount required 
to be made available by a provision of law) is 
hereby reduced by 5 percent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, this 
bill that we are debating here is a par-
tisan travesty and spends entirely 
more than this government can afford. 
That is why I rise again today to offer 
an amendment to cut spending to the 
Interior and Environment portion of 
the bill. 
In addition to its overspending, this 
bill attempts to delegitimize President 
Trump’s replacement for the Obama 
administration’s overreaching WOTUS 
rule. The farmers and landowners in 
my district will tell you how dev-
astating that would be. 
It continues down the path that the 
far left have been touting this entire 
Congress, 
implementing 
socialist 
Green New Deal policies disguised as 
emergency funding, but this couldn’t 
be further from the truth. This bill not 
only spends more of Americans’ tax-
payer dollars, but forces others to 
spend more, forcing onerous regula-
tions on American business owners 
that would ultimately lead to higher 
costs for our American families. 
Continuing to adhere to the Obama 
administration’s outdated and repres-
sive regulations would be detrimental 
not only to the energy sector workers, 
but to millions of American families 
whose budgets depend on affordable 
and reliable fuel and natural gas, and 
would 
jeopardize 
America’s 
energy 
independence. 
Today’s minibus totals $219.6 billion 
in discretionary spending, plus another 
$37.5 billion in emergency spending, 
busting the budget agreement and in-
creasing funds in the form of BCA cap- 
exempt funding, with almost a third of 
the funding of this division not subject 
to the BCA caps. 
And let me remind you that under 
the Democratic majority, we can’t

even stick to the budget that was 
agreed to. The Interior and Environ-
ment division would provide funding at 
a whopping 41.4 percent above the fis-
cal year 2020 enacted level and 59 per-
cent over the President’s request. 
While the President’s budget pro-
posed to reduce or eliminate programs 
in the EPA that are better left to 
States, communities, and private indi-
viduals, the House’s proposal for Inte-
rior and Environment maintains or in-
creases spending on EPA programs. 
I am a former business owner, and 
just like any good business owner or 
family knows, you must operate within 
a budget and make tough choices to 
live within your means. As Members of 
the people’s House, we must hold our-
selves to the same standard that Amer-
ican workers and families do. My sim-
ple amendment is a good place to start. 
b 1845 
My amendment would reduce interior 
and environmental spending by 5 per-
cent for fiscal year 2021. I am going to 
do some quick math for you. My 
amendment would cut about $2.7 bil-
lion. 
Even with my 5 percent cut, this di-
vision would still dramatically in-
crease spending for fiscal year 2021 
compared to fiscal year 2020. To be hon-
est, I wish we could cut more, but this 
is a place that I believe we can start. 
Even with my amendment, we still 
will be spending a lot of taxpayer dol-
lars, so I believe my Democratic col-
leagues could easily support this. 
Our national debt crisis can no 
longer be ignored, and my colleagues 
must take a serious look at Wash-
ington spending in order to start tak-
ing back control. 
Madam Speaker, earlier today I men-
tioned my 13 beautiful grandchildren, 
and I am excited that we have another 
one on the way. I believe it is all of our 
duties to do everything possible to 
avoid placing a $26 trillion, and grow-
ing, national debt burden on the backs 
of the next generation. 
My amendment is just a small, first 
step toward bringing fiscal responsi-
bility back to Washington. 
I urge all of my colleagues in this 
body to support my amendment today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment indiscriminately cuts 
programs in this bill, not giving one bit 
of thought to the merit of the program 
within the bill that it would cut. 
For instance, it would cut—well, it 
would cut the Indian Health Service, 
and that would mean fewer patients 
seen, especially during the COVID pan-
demic, which we know has affected the 
Native American population in a very 
dramatic, painful, and hurtful way. 
It would mean fewer safety inspec-
tors, ensuring that accidents and oil 
spills do not occur, which means en-
dangering the lives of oil rig workers 
and our environment. 
It would worsen our Nation’s drink-
ing water and sanitation infrastructure 
deferred maintenance problem, which 
means more children would be exposed 
to lead in their drinking water. 
More generally, investments in our 
environmental infrastructure and our 
public lands would be halted, and the 
associated jobs would be lost, jobs 
Americans desperately need. 
More importantly, this amendment, 
as I said, would contribute to lives 
being lost in Indian Country. And I do 
not say that lightly, Madam Speaker. 
Tribes are being particularly hard-hit 
by the coronavirus, and this amend-
ment would only compound the prob-
lem. 
And let me tell you a little more 
about what critical programs would be 
cut in Indian Country. It would mean 
cuts to basic healthcare and diabetes 
programs. It would mean cuts to child 
and maternal health. As we know, our 
Native brothers and sisters—my Native 
sisters in particular, suffer high infant 
mortality rates. It would mean cuts to 
mental health service at a time when 
this population in our country, the in-
digenous people, who were here first, 
would be suffering even more than they 
are today with the mental health cri-
sis, as they cannot go to their customs 
and traditions when mourning the loss 
of lives because of not being able to 
gather. 
It has been a nonpartisan goal of the 
Committee on Appropriations—a non-
partisan goal of this entire body—to 
work to improve the health status of 
our Native American brothers and sis-
ters. This amendment guts those ef-
forts. It will set Indiana Country back. 
I dare say, it could set Indian Country 
back by decades, because we have so 
much more work to do to address the 
health disparity. 
This amendment would not encour-
age agencies to do more with less. It 
would simply force agencies, and espe-
cially those serving our Native Amer-
ican Nations, to do less for their Tribal 
members, less healthcare. 
So I urge Members to strongly oppose 
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let me try to under-
stand what we are saying here. We 
have a $25 trillion or $26 trillion and 
growing debt in this country. I mean, 
is there no concern for future genera-
tions? 
And when you look at the explosion 
of this debt—I mean, when I saw the 
appropriations package, I could not be-
lieve it. I mean, we can’t even live 
within a budget? I mean, what kind of 
message are we sending to our children 
and grandchildren here? 
We can’t leave them with an insur-
mountable debt simply because we as a 
body refuse to take some commonsense 
steps to take back control of this 
spending. We can’t even cut 5 percent? 
I am deeply concerned about the fu-
ture of this country, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on my amendment today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, once again, this is 
an across-the-board indiscriminate cut. 
We all might agree that there are pro-
grams and activities that take place in 
these bills that we could see a cut with. 
But this is an across-the-board 5 per-
cent cut, which will deeply, deeply af-
fect the gains that we have been strug-
gling to make in a nonpartisan way in 
Indian Country, and I simply cannot be 
silent while that happens. 
We have to do what we can do to 
make sure that the treaty and obliga-
tions that this United States Govern-
ment entered into with the First Na-
tions, who were here first, are honored, 
and part of that is healthcare. 
Madam Speaker, I ask others to join 
me to oppose this amendment, which if 
passed, will harm the American people 
and do, in my opinion, irreparable dam-
age to the healthcare and education of 
our Native American brothers and sis-
ters. 
I oppose this amendment. I encour-
age my colleagues to join me. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
The Chair understands that amend-
ment No. 66 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 67 OFFERED BY MR. TONKO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 67 
printed in House Report 116–459. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, as the 
designee of Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division C of the bill (before 
the short title) insert the following: 
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available 
by this Act may be used to finalize, imple-
ment, or enforce the proposed rule titled 
‘‘Review of the National Ambient Air Qual-
ity Standards for Particulate Matter’’ pub-
lished in the Federal Register by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency on April 30, 
2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 24094 et seq.).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3825 
July 23, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as the 
designee of my very good friend, Con-
gresswoman BLUNT ROCHESTER, to offer 
and support this amendment. 
Every person deserves to breathe 
clean air. As we battle a global public 
health pandemic, that truth could not 
be more important. 
Time and time again, the administra-
tion has chosen to ignore the latest 
public health science, allowing our air 
to remain polluted and our commu-
nities to be less safe. 
The EPA’s most recent failure to pro-
pose air quality standards that will 
protect human health is unacceptable, 
and it will put tens of thousands of 
lives at risk. 
Fine particulate matter, commonly 
known as soot, is a dangerous pollut-
ant. In particular, it puts low wealth 
and communities of color at greatest 
risk. These are the communities that 
are already experiencing staggering 
death 
rates 
from 
COVID–19, 
made 
worse by decades of exposure to toxic 
pollution. 
The EPA has chosen to retain its ex-
isting 
inadequate 
standard, despite 
ample peer-reviewed studies clearly 
showing that a stronger standard is, in-
deed, justified. 
Even the EPA’s own more limited as-
sessment of the health impacts cal-
culated that strengthening the stand-
ard would prevent thousands of pre-
mature deaths. 
This amendment is simple. It would 
prohibit the EPA from finalizing its in-
sufficiently protective review of the 
National Ambient Air Quality Stand-
ards for particulate matter. 
The American people need an Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency that will 
listen to doctors and scientists and 
take the steps necessary to protect the 
health and well-being of all Americans, 
regardless of their race, income, or ZIP 
Code. 
We are in the midst of a global health 
pandemic. Protecting our health could 
not be more important than at this 
very moment. 
I, indeed, urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment and give the EPA 
the opportunity to finalize a stronger 
standard that will actually protect 
human health and the environment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), my colleague and 
friend. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
This amendment interferes with an al-
ready rigorous scientific and public re-
view process before the process has 
even been completed. 
The public comment period closed 
less than a month ago, and the EPA is 
in the process of considering more than 
66,000 public comments received and 
making corresponding changes to the 
proposal. 
The EPA’s proposal to maintain the 
standards set by President Obama 
comes after careful consideration of 
the most current available scientific 
evidence and risk and exposure infor-
mation and with consultation and con-
firmation by the agency’s independent 
science advisors. 
By maintaining the current national 
particulate matter standard, the EPA 
continues to protect our environment 
and the health of the American citizens 
without placing additional burdens on 
communities. 
There already too many States and 
counties currently struggling to meet 
the current standards, which are al-
ready among the strictest safeguards 
in the world. For these areas of our Na-
tion, the solution is to help them meet 
the bar, not raise the bar. 
The EPA remains publicly com-
mitted to helping these areas succeed, 
and to Chair MCCOLLUM’s credit, this 
bill gives the EPA the resources nec-
essary to keep doing so. 
We are on the right track. The U.S. 
has made incredible strides in reducing 
particulate 
matter 
concentrations 
across the Nation. As a result of the 
Clean Air Act, programs and efforts by 
State, local, and Tribal Governments, 
as well as technological improvements, 
average fine particulate matter con-
centrations in the U.S. fell by 39 per-
cent between 2000 and 2018, while aver-
age coarse particulate matter con-
centrations fell by 31 percent during 
the same period. 
Madam Speaker, the process that 
Congress created and continues to fund 
in this bill is working. Now it is our job 
to get out of the way. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment, and 
let the EPA do its job. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, who 
has the right to close? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has the right to 
close. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment 
would prohibit the use of any funds to 
finalize or implement or enforce the 
EPA’s recent proposal to maintain the 
current Particulate Matter National 
Air Ambient Quality Standard. 
In April of this year, the EPA pro-
posed retaining the existing particu-
late matter standard. The standard is 
12 micrograms per cubic meter of air. 
It was last reviewed and substantially 
tightened in 2013 during the previous 
administration. 
The current EPA undertook the re-
quired 5-year review of the PM stand-
ard. In a resounding 5-to-1 decision, the 
EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory 
Committee voted to retain the stand-
ard. 
The CASAC determined that there 
were substantial uncertainties with 
studies alleging to demonstrate health 
effects below the current standard. 
Following the requirements of the 
regulatory process, the EPA conducted 
a science-based review and analysis of 
the relevant data, and it proposed re-
taining the current PM standards. 
So if I have this right, the EPA con-
ducted a scientific review and analysis, 
it followed the requisite Administra-
tive Procedures Act process, and it 
made a regulatory proposal which it 
still will take public comment on, re-
view the feedback, and eventually 
make a final determination. 
So where is the misstep here that re-
quires this kind of amendment? Did the 
agency falter by listening to science? 
Did the agency falter by following the 
rulemaking process? 
What this amendment does is replace 
EPA’s science-based analysis and pro-
posal with a politically motivated Con-
gressional edict. 
b 1900 
PM2.5 emissions have dropped 37 per-
cent over the last two decades. Com-
bined pollutant emissions have de-
clined 74 percent since 1970. The U.S. 
has some of the lowest PM2.5 emissions 
in the world, including five times below 
the global average and seven times 
below Chinese levels, thanks to our rig-
orous Clean Air Act process. 
Our air is cleaner, and under this ad-
ministration, our economy has simul-
taneously 
been 
stronger. 
Facts, 
science, and process, that is what we 
should be dictating our environmental 
regulatory process. 
Indeed, we should support a rigorous 
standard-setting process for the Clean 
Air Act. Getting this right is vital. 
Setting standards unnecessarily low is 
dangerous. 
The economic, social, and physical 
collapse of communities that follow 
when factories pull out or power plants 
close due to new standards profoundly 
harms families, especially the most 
vulnerable. Getting it right is exactly 
what is happening right now with the 
administration’s proposals for particu-
late matter standards. 
The problem with my committee col-
league’s amendment is that it stops 
this important process in its tracks. It 
will deprive the public of the benefit of 
a sound science process to protect pub-
lic health for all populations. Stopping 
the scientific process does not protect 
public health. 
Support for this amendment under-
mines the Clean Air Act. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this amendment.

a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I will 
repeat. Every individual deserves the 
right to breathe clean air. Certainly, 
this pandemic has proven that certain 
areas, certain neighborhoods, certain 
populations, have been at risk. It has 
been 
proven 
by 
the 
impact 
that 
COVID–19 has borne on so many indi-
viduals and communities. 
I would like to thank Representa-
tives BLUNT ROCHESTER, MCEACHIN, and 
RUSH for authorizing this important 
amendment and for their tireless work 
to achieve environmental justice in 
carrying out our Nation’s environ-
mental laws. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair 
MCCOLLUM
of the Interior, Environ-
ment, 
and 
Related 
Agencies 
Sub-
committee for her work on this great 
bill to protect public health and the en-
vironment. 
EPA has a requirement to put for-
ward standards that are based on sound 
science and protective at the same 
time of human health. The PM pro-
posal has failed to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment to 
ensure environmental protection ex-
tends to each and every American. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the pre-

Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, on that

AMENDMENT NO. 86 OFFERED BY MR. KENNEDY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 86 
printed in House Report 116–459. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division C (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. l. (a) None of the funds made avail-
able by this Act may be used to— 
(1) rescind the September 2015 Bureau of 
Indian Affairs Record of Decision on the 
Trust Acquisition and Reservation Procla-
mation for 151 Acres in the City of Taunton, 
Massachusetts, and 170 Acres in the Town of 
Mashpee, Massachusetts, for the Mashpee 
Wampanoag Tribe; 
(2) revoke the reservation proclamation 
Proclaiming Certain Lands as Reservation 
for the Mashpee Wampanoag (81 Fed. Reg. 
948); or 
(3) annul the determination that such 
lands are eligible for gaming under the In-
dian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEN-
NEDY) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
chairman for his leadership on this bill 
and for the support of this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, in 1620, 400 years 
ago, 
the 
Pilgrims 
settled 
on 
Wampanoag land in Plymouth, Massa-
chusetts. For literally four centuries, 
the Mashpee Wampanoag people have 
been fighting for their sovereignty, for 
their land, and for their survival. And 
for generations, they have been met 
with resistance from a government 
that should be protecting and empow-
ering them. 
In the last few months, Madam 
Speaker, their fight has arrived at a 
crossroads created by a Trump admin-
istration that has treated Tribes with 
nothing but contempt since the day of 
his inauguration. 
Because of decisions made by this ad-
ministration, 
the 
Mashpee 
Wampanoag’s land may be stolen from 
them again in the coming weeks. 
We have a responsibility to do what 
is right, to learn from the mistakes of 
generations before us, to recognize that 
this land wasn’t land to be discovered 
or to be taken. It belonged to Tribes 
like the Mashpee long before the Pil-
grims arrived. 
Madam Speaker, we need to pass this 
amendment to right the wrongs of the 
past, to prevent them from becoming 
the wrongs of the present. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition, very strong oppo-
sition, to this amendment. 
The amendment continues the efforts 
in this House to halt enforcement of a 
Federal court action on this matter in 
order to build a massive 400,000-square- 
foot off-reservation gaming complex 
for the benefit of Genting, a foreign 
Malaysian gaming company. 
Since we considered this legislation 
last year, there have been a number of 
important events, including just last 
month when the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
in Boston served a Federal grand jury 
subpoena to the Mashpee Wampanoag 
Tribe last month for a hefty number of 
documents and financial records. 
Yet, here we are once again, mis-
guidedly considering the establishment 
of two separate reservations for the 
Mashpee Tribe of Massachusetts. 
One reservation will be the town of 
Mashpee, the Tribe’s historic reserva-
tion lands. No casino will be allowed 
within ‘‘the geographic boundaries of 
the town of Mashpee.’’ 
The other reservation will be 50 miles 
away from Mashpee in the city of 
Taunton. This site is not part of the 
Tribe’s historic reservation and was se-
lected by the Tribe and Genting for a 
billion-dollar casino project because of 
its proximity to the Providence, Rhode 
Island, casino market, a 20-mile dis-
tance. 
There is no reason for the second res-
ervation other than to build an off-res-
ervation casino 50 miles away from 
where the Mashpee Tribe currently re-
sides. 
In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act with the in-
tent to restrict casinos to Tribes’ origi-
nal reservations in order to protect the 
States and the rights of citizens of 
those States. 
By placing land in trust for the 
Mashpee Tribe for gaming in Taunton, 
this amendment creates an off-reserva-
tion casino, which is inconsistent with 
congressional intent. This is often 
called reservation shopping, and it is 
an abuse of the Indian Gaming Regu-
latory Act. 
Now, the Tribe’s lawyers knew that 
reservation shopping was a political 
headache, so they went to bureaucrats 
within the BIA to obtain the two res-
ervations through administrative ac-
tion. But let’s be honest, this isn’t 
about the Mashpee Tribe. This is about 
Genting Malaysia. This amendment is 
really about just a financial bailout for 
Genting. 
The Tribe is swamped with more 
than $500-plus million in debt to 
Genting, and there is no way the Tribe 
can ever pay this back and still make 
enough 
money 
to 
sustain 
itself. 
Genting, therefore, will be the real 
owner of the project, not the Tribe. 
This kind of arrangement, where the 
creditor practically controls the finan-
cial futures of a debtor Tribe, is con-
trary to the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act, which requires every Tribal casino 
to be 100 percent tribally owned. 
Moreover, the American Principles 
Project reports on the ties between 
convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff and 
the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, stat-
ing, ‘‘The expansive Abramoff inves-
tigation uncovered major corruption 
within the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. 
Its chief, Glenn Marshall, pled guilty in 
2009 to multiple Federal charges, in-
cluding embezzling Tribal funds and 
campaign 
finance 
violations 
com-
mitted while working with Abramoff to 
secure Federal recognition’’ in 2007. 
This disastrous project has garnered 
its broad share of opposition, including 
President Trump, Democrats, and Re-
publicans. The project is also strenu-
ously opposed by the other federally 
recognized Tribe in Massachusetts. 
For Members on both sides of the 
aisle, do you really want your name 
tied to a Tribe that only received Fed-
eral recognition in 2007 as a result of 
shady lobbying by Jack Abramoff? Do

you really want to vote for a $500 mil-
lion bailout for a foreign gaming cor-
poration? 
More importantly, while everyone is 
innocent until proven guilty, prudence 
suggests that Congress wait until the 
completion of the ongoing Federal 
grand jury investigation before acting 
on any gambling legislation related to 
a foreign entity and an Indian Tribe 
that appears to be the target of that 
investigation. 
In short, this amendment attempts, 
once again, to force an off-reservation 
casino, bails out a foreign corporation 
from major financial problems of its 
own making, undoes the judgment of a 
Federal court, and contradicts a Su-
preme Court ruling. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
of both sides of the aisle to vote 
against this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. KEATING). 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I 
speak in favor of this amendment. 
On March 27, 2 weeks after the U.S. 
Government had declared a state of 
emergency due to the COVID–19 virus, 
leaders of the Mashpee Wampanoag 
Tribe, the Tribe that helped the Pil-
grim forefathers survive the devasta-
tion of illness and starvation in their 
first winter, received a phone call from 
the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s of-
fice. 
Now, you would think that maybe 
they were going to see how the Tribe 
was doing, a Tribe that is dispropor-
tionately affected by the virus. Maybe 
they were calling to see if they needed 
any help. Regrettably, that wasn’t the 
case. 
In an act with discretionary timing, 
and one of the most reprehensible acts 
I have witnessed since I have been here 
in this Congress, they were informing 
them that, on behalf the U.S. Govern-
ment, they were taking away their 
land, their buildings, their medical 
center, and leaving them in financial 
ruins. 
Now, fortunately, the D.C. Circuit 
judge rebuffed this unconscionable act, 
calling it arbitrary, capricious, con-
trary to law, and unusually so, calling 
it an abuse of power. 
Now, due to the close relationship be-
tween the White House and the lob-
bying group that is dealing with this, 
this could rear its ugly head again. 
This amendment is different than the 
three that we passed before, in terms of 
legislation. It is much more narrow. 
All it does is make sure the Tribe, the 
Tribe which helped the Pilgrims sur-
vive their first year, is allowed to do so 
themselves in the coming year. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, once 
again, the facts are the facts. I know 
there are gut-wrenching applications. I 
dealt with Tribes my whole life. But 
the facts are the facts. This amend-
ment is egregious. The facts are the 
facts. 
Two reservational applications is in-
comprehensible. It violates the very 
law that we actually passed. 
Now, if you disagree with the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act, be my guest, 
change it. But that is not what we do. 
We follow the law. The law is the law. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I would 
ask everybody to vote against this 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I 
stand today with my colleagues from 
Massachusetts in support of the Mash-
pee Wampanoag Tribe and in support of 
Tribal sovereignty, and I ask my col-
leagues to pass this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment offered by my 
friend and colleague from Massachusetts. 
This amendment would effectively prevent 
the Department of Interior from moving for-
ward with a decision to revoke tribal lands 
from being held in trust. Although I appreciate 
my colleague’s advocacy on behalf of the tribe 
in his state, the tribal land trust process is 
based on complex legal precedent and has no 
business being included in a bill to fund the 
federal government. We are familiar with the 
complexities of tribal law in Rhode Island as 
the Supreme Court’s decision in Carcieri v. 
Salazar had implications for our state. But any 
legislative remedy for Carcieri shouldn’t lie in 
an ad hoc approach that favors one particular 
tribe. 
What’s more, this amendment could cause 
serious economic harm to Rhode Island. It ef-
fectively preserves the opportunity for the con-
struction of a new casino in Taunton, Massa-
chusetts, by putting pending administrative de-
cisions on hold for the next year. My col-
leagues in the Massachusetts delegation are 
hoping for a last minute judicial or administra-
tive reversal that would allow the stalled ca-
sino project to begin. The project would be in 
direct competition with established casinos just 
over the state line. Twin River and Tiverton 
casinos have been important economic drivers 
in my state, generating hundreds of millions of 
dollars each year. We are already feeling the 
economic impacts of the coronavirus pan-
demic in Rhode Island, as I know our neigh-
bors are in Massachusetts. If this amendment 
becomes law, it could compound the eco-
nomic pain for our businesses, their workers, 
and our state. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in strong opposition to this 
amendment. This amendment would seek to 
ignore a U.S. Supreme Court federal standard 
and allow the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to 
open an off-reservation casino right on the 
border of Rhode Island. 
Under the Indian Reorganization Act, the 
U.S. Department of Interior is only allowed to 
take land into trust for tribes recognized before 
1934. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe be-
came federally recognized in 2007. This 
amendment will set a dangerous precedent 
and undermine both a U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling and disregard the U.S. Department of 
Interior’s most recent ruling. 
An off-reservation casino would result in an 
overwhelming economic loss to my state’s 
economy. The COVID–19 pandemic has dealt 
a great blow to my state, hitting the travel and 
tourism industry particularly hard. Casinos in 
Rhode Island generated $300 million in annual 
revenue before closing due to the pandemic. 
An off-reservation casino would further dev-
astate the financial loss to my state currently 
facing a 12.4 percent unemployment rate in 
June, higher than the national average. We as 
a Congress should not be circumventing the 
court’s decision and allow a one-time carve 
out for the building of a casino that is bad for 
Rhode Island. Regardless of this amendment, 
the Mashpee Tribe will still be a federally rec-
ognized tribe and will continue to receive fed-
eral benefits. 
Make no mistake, this amendment does not 
aim to help the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, 
but instead help lobbyists secure a win for 
their own interests. This amendment will do 
more than just greatly damage the Rhode Is-
land economy, it will put Congress on a path 
of hand-picking winners and losers over the 
court’s decision. This amendment would signal 
it’s okay for lobbyists and hedge funds to be 
the decision makers in Congress, and not the 
representatives of the people. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in strongly opposing this 
amendment.

thousands of pages in Federal regula-
tions and billions of dollars in compli-
ance costs. The families, farmers, and

small businesses of Missouri could not 
keep up. 
Thankfully, 
since 
taking 
office, 
President Trump has kept his promise 
to deliver regulatory relief to the 
American people. He has removed 
seven regulations for every new one 
added, saving households thousands of 
dollars a year in regulatory costs. 
The other side would have you be-
lieve that reining in the EPA by reduc-
ing funding leads to dirtier air and 
dirtier water when, in fact, the oppo-
site is the case. Under President 
Trump, emissions have fallen in every 
major 
category 
and 
overall 
have 
dropped 7 percent since 2017. Right 
now, we have the cleanest air since 
1970. That is 50 years. 
Democrats want to take us back to 
Obama-Biden 
era 
spending 
policies 
with this funding bill, which breaks the 
recently agreed to spending caps and 
returns us to the regulatory machine 
of the prior administration that harms 
small businesses and family farmers. 
But the American people are not inter-
ested in returning to the increased 
costs and overregulation of that ad-
ministration. 
My amendment simply reduces fund-
ing for the EPA to reflect President 
Trump’s budget request. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, 
for 4 years in a row, President Trump 
has set up a truly—well, he sent us a 
budget that is just not workable when 
it comes to his budget request. 
On a bipartisan amendment, espe-
cially when it comes to the EPA, we 
have passed budgets at the end and 
sent them over to the EPA with more 
money than the President has re-
quested. And why? Because we know we 
have to fight to have clean air, clean 
water. We need to have good scientists. 
We need to have researchers. We need 
to have people out doing inspections. 
We need to have our Environmental 
Protection Agency working. 
As I pointed out, the Congress has 
overwhelmingly rejected these requests 
for the President’s cuts to the EPA. I 
predict we are going to see that happen 
again, for a fourth year in a row. That 
is because the EPA’s environmental 
programs and management account 
does vital work, really important work 
protecting our air and drinking water, 
restoring our waterways, and safe-
guarding us from toxic chemicals. 
It has been reported worldwide, be-
cause of COVID, we all know people are 
driving less. We know that our fac-
tories, unfortunately, aren’t running 
the way they should be, and a lot of 
people are out of work. So, yes, the air 
quality has improved because of the 
President’s mishandling of the COVID 
emergency that we are facing. But we 
don’t want to go back to those pollu-
tion levels. We want to work together 
in a bipartisan way. 
Another thing that the gentleman 
cuts 
are 
the 
geographic 
programs 
hugely popular in this Congress, and 
here, they are overwhelmingly sup-
ported 
bipartisanly—program 
work 
like the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, 
Puget Sound, Long Island Sound, and 
the Florida estuaries. These programs 
would be devastated if we adopted the 
President’s budget. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
asked for robust funding in these ac-
counts. Rural communities that rely 
upon technical assistance grants in 
this account, we help them to make 
sure that they can afford safe drinking 
water for their constituents and that 
they can safely manage their sewer and 
wastewater systems. We worked to-
gether to help rural communities. 
Consumers rely on the EPA’s EN-
ERGY STAR program to help them 
choose 
energy-efficient 
appliances, 
which save them money and help the 
environment. Madam Speaker, I can 
speak from personal experience, having 
sold appliances for many years, how 
important that ENERGY STAR was to 
someone when they were making a de-
cision because they wanted to save 
money on their electric bill. 
Well, the Trump budget, the way it 
was presented to our subcommittee, 
would have slashed all these programs 
and much more, and the impacts to 
public health would be devastating. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly agree that we should be investing 
more to protect our families from pol-
lution, not less. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, more money is not always the 
answer. The right policies, efficiency, 
is the answer. 
As I said earlier, for the first time in 
50 years, under Trump’s policies and 
Trump’s spending, we have the cleanest 
air since 1970. 
I am not sure why the majority is 
concerned about cutting funding for 
the EPA when they have included $13 
billion in additional emergency fund-
ing in this bill for the EPA alone. 
My amendment is not about pre-
venting the EPA from doing its job. It 
is about ensuring that the EPA does 
the job we gave it to do and nothing 
else. 
Now is not the time to return to the 
spending habits and overregulation of 
the Obama-Biden era. If this funding 
amount is good enough for the Presi-
dent, it is good enough for me. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
am glad the gentleman brought up the 
$15 billion in the EPA’s emergency 
spending budget. 
It is for wastewater treatment. That 
is for clean drinking water. That is for 
infrastructure. That is for jobs. That is 
so the next generation inherits clean 
water and a sewage waste disposal sys-
tem that they don’t find crumbling all 
around them because of neglect and be-
cause we have not lived up to our obli-
gation to take care of those infrastruc-
ture investments. 
For 50 years, the EPA has been re-
sponsible for protecting health and the 
environment, and they have been doing 
a job in cleaning up the environment, 
as I mentioned with the restoration 
programs. The Chesapeake Bay, it is 
amazing what has happened, the Great 
Lakes. 
Congressman JOYCE and I are con-
stantly 
working 
with 
other 
Great 
Lakes 
representatives, 
Republicans, 
Democrats, and Independents, who ask 
us to do even more in investing. 
These Trump administration budget 
cuts that the gentleman would have us 
return to would cripple the EPA’s abil-
ity to accomplish those missions. I 
urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment.

Register, and billions in compliance 
costs for American farmers, small busi-
nesses, and families, much of this 
backed by flawed research with a polit-
ical agenda. 
The Office of Science and Technology 
aids in the regulatory process and is re-
sponsible for the faulty research that 
led to costly regulations like the social 
cost of carbon and the Clean Power 
Plan. 
The American people need trans-
parent research without an agenda. 
They don’t need Obama-Biden era regu-
lations and spending policies. 
The amendment, once again, simply 
reduces funding for the EPA to reflect 
President Trump’s budget request. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, as 
I said on the other amendment, for 4 
years in a row, President Trump has 
sent us truly appalling budget request 
numbers for the EPA, and the Congress 
has overwhelmingly rejected these re-
quests on a bipartisan basis. As I said, 
I predict we will do that again for the 
fourth year in a row. 
The EPA’s science and technology 
account does vital research on health 
effects of toxic chemicals and pollut-
ants. Now, the Trump administration, 
by not doing this research and by not 
moving forward, protects corporate 
polluters’ profits, not the health and 
safety of the American people. That is 
why, in my opinion, the administra-
tion’s budget proposes to cut hundreds 
of millions of dollars for funding re-
search on things like PFAS. 
Now, in my constituency, I have sev-
eral major municipalities that can no 
longer just take the water out of the 
ground the way that they had before, 
send it to the homeowners, and they 
could turn on their tap and safely 
drink it. No, it has to be filtered for 
PFAS. We need research. We need 
standards on it. 
Lead. How many discussions have we 
had on this House floor? How many 
parents have we heard from? How 
many children have we heard from 
about the effects of lead in water? 
Mercury. I am from Minnesota. We 
have fish advisories because of mer-
cury. Pregnant women have to be care-
ful how much fish they consume. We 
have postings when we go to our lakes 
about how much fish we can consume. 
Mercury is a concern to many of us. 
And climate change. I am not afraid 
to talk about climate change. I was 
just on the phone with the Secretary of 
the Air Force, and we were talking 
about what we are going to have to 
spend in Alaska. You know, the perma-
frost is causing issues with radar in-
stallations not being stable—climate 
change. The permafrost, which is dis-
appearing, is affecting the ability for 
runways and safe landings. Climate 
change. 
So, do we need to do the research on 
climate change? It is a national secu-
rity issue. I am glad the EPA is out 
there looking at it, working with other 
agencies within the United States. 
People across this country over-
whelmingly agree we should be invest-
ing more research in PFAS. We should 
be getting the lead out of our water. 
We should be understanding what is 
going on with mercury. We should also 
be addressing the effects of climate 
change and, most of all, protecting our 
families from pollution. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, if you listen to my Democrat 
colleagues, you would think the EPA 
could not go on without this funding 
that we are trying to reduce. It is 
about being efficient. 
This administration, as I had said 
earlier, under President Trump, emis-
sions have fallen in every major cat-
egory and overall have dropped 7 per-
cent since 2017. Right now, we have the 
cleanest air since 1970. 
Throwing money at an issue you care 
about is not the solution. Being effi-
cient in government is the solution, 
and that is what the Trump EPA has 
done. 
b 1930 
So they have asked for this par-
ticular amount of money, and I am 
making sure that we are giving the 
EPA what they need, not busting the 
spending caps which were agreed to by 
Republicans and Democrats by their 
current proposal. 
Let’s keep the spending caps. Let’s 
adopt my amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
will read from the National Geo-
graphic, published April 8, 2020: 
‘‘As the novel coronavirus tears 
around the world, it’s exploiting our 
biggest 
weaknesses, 
from 
creaking 
health care systems to extreme social 
inequality. Its relationship with one 
pervasive and neglected problem, how-
ever, has been more tangled: Air pollu-
tion has intensified the pandemic. 
. . .’’ 
So we need to do studies on that, and 
the EPA works on that, but at the 
same time, the coronavirus has tempo-
rarily cleaned the skies. 
As I said earlier, for 50 years, the 
EPA has been responsible for pro-
tecting public health and the environ-
ment. 
We need to do research to understand 
how to protect public health and the 
environment; and more importantly 
than ever, we need to understand how 
to protect public health and the envi-
ronment for people who have long been 
neglected, the people who are suffering 
the most right now, and that is the in-
equality, the injustice we are seeing 
between Black and Brown people in the 
United States. 
We need to do better with the EPA 
for addressing social injustices that 
have affected those populations most 
by living in polluted areas and being 
subjected to pollution. I want to work 
on that in Congress. The administra-
tion’s cuts would cripple the EPA’s 
ability to achieve that mission. 
Madam Speaker, if I understand cor-
rectly, the gentleman has yielded his 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1060, the pre-
vious 
question

amendment offered by the gentleman

ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of H.R. 7608 is postponed.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIM) 
laid before the House the following 
communication from the Clerk of the 
House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, July 23, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives,

DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the

of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on 
July 23, 2020, at 2:00 p.m.:

WOMEN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO 
SERVE IN DIGNITY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
sometimes it is very difficult to re-
spond to something that is so much out 
of the ordinary, but I rise today to 
refer to my colleague, ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, and to make mention 
of the incident that occurred where she 
was described in unflattering words. 
Those words were denigrating to a 
woman. They were equally denigrating 
to women of color. 
One’s views in this place are pro-
tected by the Constitution and pro-
tected by the First Amendment, but it 
is particularly sad when one’s par-
ticular gender is called out and de-
graded, for women have been the back-
bone of this Nation. They have helped

United States military. 
Our Member of Congress from The 
Bronx, New York, has equally been 
elected by her constituents, and de-
serves the kind of respect and under-
standing that all of those who take the 
oath deserve. I am appalled by the 
words that were used against her. 
I stand with her remarks of expres-
sion of the right to have different 
views, and I also stand with her as a 
woman who would respect that service 
and that unique service that we who 
have come to this place where we could 
not be for many, many years to serve, 
she should be allowed to serve, and 
serve in dignity.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE 
JOHN LEWIS 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I was 
on my way out and I saw the beautiful 
white flowers that are sitting on my 
side of the aisle celebrating the life of 
John Lewis. 
Last night, I had the radio on and I 
was listening to C–SPAN, and I heard 
the wonderful, wonderful stories on 
both sides of the aisle of people cele-
brating John’s life and what he meant 
to them. 
As I was preparing for this bill and 
working on this bill, working on the in-
equalities of years of systemic racism 
and how it has infected the environ-
ment made me even want to champion 
this bill that was before us today even 
more, as a remembrance of all the 
work that needs to be done. 
As people were sharing their stories 
of John, what came to mind for me was 
talking about gardening. He loved to 
garden and he had a few plants, and we 
would talk about them. 
He loved to fish, and the one thing I 
would always tease him about, Mr. 
Speaker, is going to Minnesota and 
going ice fishing. 
Well, John, that is going to have to 
wait, but I look forward to seeing you 
again in the heavens, and we will go ice 
fishing.

WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR OUR 
COUNTRY 
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
quote from the great Alexander Fraser, 
who wrote about the decline of democ-
racy. The nations have progressed 
through this sequence. Very few have 
existed past 200 years, but they all 
come to an end. 
They go ‘‘from bondage to spiritual 
faith; from spiritual faith to great 
courage; from courage to liberty; from 
liberty to abundance; from abundance 
to selfishness; from selfishness to . . . 
apathy; from apathy to dependence; 
from dependence back into bondage.’’ 
I think now we are at a point in time 
in history where we have got to fight 
for our freedom, we have got to fight 
for our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that people now 
get involved who have never been in-
volved before. 
f 
AMERICA IS A GREAT NATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the 
topic of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, we 
are here as lovers of liberty, as patri-
ots, as people concerned about the fu-
ture of our country, just citizen legis-
lators, people who have children and 
grandchildren and who want our pos-
terity to inherit the blessings of lib-
erty and all of the opportunities this 
great Nation has afforded not only my-
self and my colleagues, but all Ameri-
cans. 
America is a great nation, and God 
has truly blessed America. America has 
been a blessing to the world, and as 
President Trump has said, we must 
keep America great. 
It is not just what that statement 
means to our citizens and to our chil-
dren and the next generation of Ameri-
cans; it is what America means and 
what this great experiment at liberty 
and democracy means for the entire 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk 
about the substance of that greatness, 
the true substance of it. 
I would suggest that what makes 
America great is the American people 
and the values, the beliefs—what de-
fines us—our culture, what we esteem. 
That is what we must remember as 
we legislate, as we lead and represent 
our citizens throughout this great 
land, that what makes America great 
and what will keep America great are 
America’s values. We must defend 
them. We must promote them. 
b 1945 
We must fight for a future that has 
those values of faith, In God We Trust, 
one Nation under the sovereignty of 
God, with a firm belief, as John Adams 
says, that the Constitution is only 
good for a moral and religious people, 
for example. 
He understood that, at the founda-
tion of this great country, that we 
would only be able to persist, and we 
have only persisted as the longest de-
mocracy in the history of the world be-
cause we bow the knee to our sovereign 
God, who, as Ben Franklin said, if a 
sparrow cannot fall to the ground apart 
from His will, then a Nation cannot 
rise apart from it. And I would submit 
that this great Nation cannot persist 
without that. 
We recognize that you can pass all 
the laws you want and, certainly, laws 
have their place in civil order, and the 
enforcement of those laws are critical 
for the domestic tranquility of our 
country. But you are not going to 
change anyone’s heart through passing 
laws. 
And John Adams and our Founders 
understood that if this republic would 
continue for generations it would be 
because we always remembered that 
above and beyond passing good laws 
and making good policy is that we 
would recognize that we have a higher 
accountability, 
and 
that 
account-
ability is Almighty God, that same God 
whose providential hand was with this 
Nation from the very beginning and, I 
pray, will continue with all of us, on 
both sides of the aisle. 
Every person that swears an oath and 
has the good fortune and privilege of 
serving, I pray God’s gracious and 
providential hand will continue to 
guide us in the challenges that we face 
today. 
We have our 21st century challenges, 
just like every generation has and, I 
would submit, we must return to what 
made this country great. 
Tonight, we are going to reflect on 
America’s values, America’s culture, 
and America’s heritage, and why it 
matters to fight and defend those val-
ues. 
I have dear friends who are much 
more articulate, Mr. Speaker, than I 
am on this, and they speak from the 
heart. They speak with personal con-
viction. They ran for office to serve, 
and to strive for a more perfect union, 
and to hand this country better than 
we found it to their children and grand-
children. 
One of those individuals is RALPH 
NORMAN, from the great State of South 
Carolina, a businessman who decided 
that he would make tremendous sac-
rifice. He has got a beautiful and big 
family, and he said this is the best way 
he can love his grandchildren is to love 
his 
country 
through 
service 
and 
through making it better by passing 
the right laws and upholding the right 
values. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman for having this 
Special Order. It couldn’t come at a 
more unique time. The history, defin-
ing America’s values, our culture, and 
our heritage, now more than ever, need 
to be spotlighted. 
The gentleman summed it up well. It 
boils down to three things, faith, fam-
ily, and country; faith, family, and 
country. 
America finds herself in an hour of 
peril. In the recent weeks and months,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3831 
July 23, 2020 
we have seen the unhinging of civil 
order and the near collapse of the rule 
of law in certain cities. 
This Chamber should serve as the 
shining example for the rest of our 
great country. Sadly, we are failing to 
live up to that expectation. Instead of 
open and honest debate, we are allow-
ing the ‘‘cancel culture’’ to creep inside 
these hallowed Halls that have stood 
for centuries. 
We hear calls for a ‘‘national conver-
sion,’’ a ‘‘wider debate,’’ or a ‘‘public 
reckoning,’’ and every day, we are de-
nied it. A new regime of liberal gate-
keepers is intent on enforcing this new 
dogma, even in institutions previously 
sworn to uphold the importance of the 
free exchange of ideas. 
Instead of opportunities for many in 
America to grow and evolve through 
discourse, Americans are now losing 
their livelihood and loved ones over 
newly invented apostasies. I invite my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to join me in denouncing this uncivil 
and, to be honest with you, un-Amer-
ican way of disagreeing. We must re-
mind the American people of our beau-
tiful land what it looks like to 
agreeably disagree. 
From the exchange of ideas, we can 
achieve the negotiations and com-
promises that make up the foundation 
and the fabric of this great Nation and 
are the stepping-stones to a more per-
fect Union. 
The Federal Government has an obli-
gation to make sure that any institu-
tion it supports upholds the Bill of 
Rights, including the right of freedom 
of speech. 
It does not give you, however, the 
right to tear down this great Nation. It 
does not give you the right to tear 
down people’s dreams, money that was 
put in, dollars that were put in to 
building a lifelong business, to destroy. 
You do not build America up by tear-
ing down America. We cannot do this 
in the current state of cancelation. 
Until we can once again welcome dis-
agreement, debate, and a healthy ex-
change of ideas, I fear for our future; I 
fear for our children; and I fear for our 
grandchildren. 
In the words of Winston Churchill, 
who had the fantastic quote when 
Great Britain was under siege by Ger-
many, he said: 
There will be a time when doing your best 
is not good enough. We must do what is re-
quired. 
And I will call on all Americans and, 
really, on both sides of the aisle, to do 
what is required to keep America 
great; to make it even greater; and to 
go for what made this country great, to 
uphold our Constitution, our Bill of 
Rights, and our God-given freedoms 
that can only come from God. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
ARRINGTON
for having this Special 
Order. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, and I consider 
him a great friend. As he spoke, I was 
thinking about the statement that 
Alexis de Tocqueville made that, I 
think, truly hits at the heart of this 
experiment that has persisted as the 
greatest beacon of liberty in all the 
land and, I mean, in all the globe, and 
that is America is great because Amer-
ica is good. And part of our goodness is 
civil discourse and debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to introduce 
another classmate and colleague of 
ours, JIM BANKS; and he was part of our 
class that came in and said from the 
outset we need civil discourse. We have 
strong convictions. We have deeply 
held beliefs, and we will fight for the 
traditional American values that we 
believe have made America great. 
But we can do that right here, with-
out tearing a single person down, and 
contributing to the swampiness of this 
place and being a great example to gen-
erations of Americans. 
The gentleman represents that. He is 
a great statesman, a great American. I 
thank him for his time. 
The next colleague of mine, from the 
Hoosier State, who is, no doubt, a free-
dom fighter, and who I am terribly 
honored to serve with, and to know his 
beautiful family, his wife, Amanda, and 
his three children. I thank Representa-
tive BANKS for joining us and taking 
part in this discussion about defending 
America’s values. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS). 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and colleague from the great 
State of Texas for organizing this im-
portant conversation that we are hav-
ing here this evening. There is so 
much, as the gentleman has already 
said, that makes America great, our 
history, our culture, our values, our 
people. 
But, Mr. Speaker, 300 years ago, colo-
nists left their homes to come to these 
shores and become free. They didn’t 
want to be bullied for their beliefs any-
more. 
Our Founding Fathers thought this 
freedom was so important they en-
shrined it in the First Amendment. But 
it is under attack more than ever 
today in the form of what has become 
known as the ‘‘cancel culture.’’ 
If you hold the wrong beliefs; if you 
support the wrong candidate; if you af-
filiate yourself with the wrong party; if 
you watch the wrong news network, 
you can get canceled; which means 
that they can take your job, they can 
take your privacy and your reputation 
away from you in a flash. 
You can even get canceled for not 
doing something. If you refuse to utter 
or endorse the so-called politically cor-
rect movements or phrases, they will 
come to destroy you. 
This is an affront to the very idea of 
what America is and who we are, as 
Americans, and I vow to fight it with 
every fiber of my being. 
I appreciate my colleague from Texas 
organizing this Special Order to talk 
about these important issues, but from 
the bottom of my heart, this is what is 
on my mind and my heart as we serve 
in this body today. We have got to do 
everything we can to change it. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my beloved brother in Christ 
and dear friend for not only his service 
as a Member of Congress, but for his 
service in wearing the uniform. 
I think, at its core, this mission that 
we have to steward and to protect, as 
the Federal Government’s limited—em-
phasis on limited—role in the affairs of 
our great citizenry, is to keep us safe 
and keep us free. 
I thank the gentleman for doing that 
for his whole career. And God bless him 
for his service, both in the military and 
here in the United States Congress. I 
am honored to serve with him. 
Now, another liberty loving Texan 
who has been in public service, who has 
been a prosecutor, and has been a lead-
er for our Lone Star State; and, now, 
he too, has been willing to leave a lot 
of good things behind, including a lov-
ing family, to come up here to this city 
and to fight for our freedom, to change 
the culture of this place so that it 
serves the people who hold the sov-
ereignty and the future in their hands. 
He is a dear friend, and I am honored to 
have him, CHIP ROY, of the great State 
of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, my father is a 
proud west Texan, also a proud grad-
uate of Texas Tech University, as the 
gentleman well knows. And I just ap-
preciate the gentleman’s passion for 
this country and what he is doing by 
giving us this time to talk in defense of 
the greatness of our Nation. 
Now, I wouldn’t think I would be 
standing on the floor of the House of 
Representatives having to defend the 
greatness of the United States of 
America. We were sitting in this very 
Chamber, in the State of the Union ad-
dress, when the President of the United 
States was touting the greatness of 
this country, and only about half of 
this body stood up to clap its hands to 
agree about the greatness of this coun-
try. 
I just want to say, you know, as a 
Member of this body, of one-435th, and 
one-half of one-third of the Federal 
Government, I believe this country is 
great. 
b 2000 
I am proud of this country. I am 
unapologetically proud to be an Amer-
ican. Flaws we have because we are 
flawed men and flawed women. We 
know that. It is certainly a tenet of my 
faith, and that is faith in the Almighty 
and faith in the Lord and my Savior 
Jesus Christ. But for Him, I would be 
condemned because we are flawed. But 
we have to remember that this country 
has stood for something greater. 
Just a few weeks ago, I went up to 
Independence Hall in Philadelphia on 
the 244th anniversary of our separation 
from the crown. I went into Independ-

crown. It was an honor to be there. I 
went up there to record a video. I never 
thought I would have to record a video 
saying why this building, Independence 
Hall, and why these monuments are 
important. 
It is not the bricks; it is not the mor-
tar; it is not the marble; and it is not 
the iron. It is the ideals they represent. 
It is the ideals that this country was 
founded upon, and it is those ideals 
that carry forward. 
We will never measure up to those 
ideals because we are flawed human 
beings, but we will always be striving 
to achieve the greatness that our 
Founders laid out for us and that our 
forefathers and our current brothers 
and sisters have died and bled for. 
When we go down to the World War II 
Memorial and see 4,000—and I can’t re-
member the exact number—4,100 al-
most stars on that monument, that is 
one for every 100 Americans who gave 
their life thousands of miles away in 
Europe and in the Pacific, fighting for 
something far greater than they. 
It wasn’t for conquest. It was to stop 
tyranny. It was to stop fascism. It was 
to stop the spread of that around the 
globe. That is what our country rep-
resents. 
We had the great clash in our Civil 
War a mere 80 years after our founding. 
Few republics in the history of man-
kind would have survived that. But it 
was because it was for the fulfillment 
of the Declaration. It was a fight for 
the fulfillment of those ideals and the 
greatness of this country. 
That greatness is exemplified by our 
heritage. My grandmother was a single 
mom in west Texas, in Sweetwater, 
Texas, because my grandfather died of 
cancer when my dad was 7 years old. 
Now, imagine her finding out my fa-
ther had polio—a pandemic—in Sep-
tember 1949 while my grandfather was 
dying of cancer. Then he passes away 
in November, and my dad coming home 
from the hospital for a few days each 
week to be able to see his dad, whom he 
had only seen for 2 years because his 
dad was in the Pacific. 
Then my grandmother, a single mom 
in west Texas, runs and becomes the 
first woman elected county clerk in 
Nolan County, Texas. She raises my 
dad and gets him through therapy. My 
dad is still alive and walking today be-
cause of her hard work, taking on dou-
ble jobs. 
He goes on to be the first to go to 
college, Texas Tech. I go on to be the 
first to go to graduate school, and now 
here I am in Congress. 
This story is not unique. Each and 
every one of us has one of those stories. 
That is the greatness of this country. 
Her dad, my grandmother’s dad, had 
lost the farm in the Depression. 
How many stories do you know like 
that? 
He went on to be the janitor in a 
church in Sweetwater, Texas, for the 
rest of his life after he lost the farm. It 
was noble. It was noble because he was 
raising my grandmother and raising 
my dad, who was newly without a fa-
ther. 
That was what we do. That is what 
we do as Americans. That is our great-
ness. I am just, frankly, not going to 
apologize for it. I am not. I love this 
country. 
As we sit here in the face of a pan-
demic, why is our leadership telling 
our country to cower in fear? That is 
not the American way. That polio that 
struck my father? We beat it. 
Mr. Speaker, 30,000 kids died and 
300,000 got injured. MITCH MCCONNELL 
is one of them. My dad is one of them. 
He walks with a hobble today. But we 
beat it with the Salk vaccine. 
We beat the Germans. We beat the 
Japanese. We have been fighting and 
standing up against the evils of totali-
tarianism. We took down the Soviet 
Union when Mr. Reagan said ‘‘tear 
down that wall’’ to Mr. Gorbachev. 
That is who we are as a country. I am 
just not going to apologize for it. 
Here is the thing: Why aren’t we 
talking as a group together on a bipar-
tisan basis instead of tearing each 
other down? Why aren’t we talking 
about the great things that we have 
been achieving? 
Fifty million tests. Think about 
that. Fifty million tests—more than 
Russia, India, and the U.K. combined. 
That is an extraordinary achievement. 
How many ventilators? How many 
PPE, et cetera? 
I have all sorts of numbers, but we 
have an extraordinary production: 19 
billion gloves, 775 million surgical 
masks, 187 million N95 respirators, 32 
million face shields, and we keep 
pumping them out. 
Doctors have been working through 
the night, trying to figure out how to 
keep people alive and work through 
this pandemic and fight through it. Our 
fatality rate is going down, and it has 
been going down for 12 consecutive 
weeks. 
We should be applauding that and 
championing that. We shouldn’t be 
backbiting about what the President 
says or what somebody in this body 
says. We should be championing the 
greatness of this country to overcome 
this pandemic because that is what we 
are doing. 
We should be making the American 
people confident to be able to get their 
kids back to school. Why? Because this 
virus—God, 
thank 
You—this 
virus 
doesn’t attack our kids, at least the 
data currently shows that. We can 
adapt if that changes. But that is the 
clear truth. 
Let’s listen to the epidemiologists 
from Stanford like Dr. Ioannidis and 
Dr. Scott Atlas. Let’s listen to the re-
ports from Oxford and Yale, hardly 
some institutions of far-rightwing ex-
tremism. These are doctors who are 
telling us that our kids can go back to 
school, that we can go back to work, 
and that we can keep our country open. 
Why does that matter? Because being 
closed is harming our kids and harming 
our 
society. 
Forty-five 
percent 
of 
Black-owned businesses have been crip-
pled, crushed, and closed during this. A 
study by Harvard said that 110,000 
American small businesses would like-
ly close their doors permanently. We 
have seen the jobless claims, almost 50 
million jobless claims. I think we are 
hovering around 20 million still. These 
are real people, real people’s lives. 
Next week is the 9-year anniversary 
since I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma. I walked into the doctor’s 
office, and I asked the doctor: Well, 
what are my chances, doc? 
I have stage 3. 
He said: Well, I am not going to tell 
you that number because, for you, it is 
zero percent or 100 percent. What are 
you going to choose? 
I chose 100 percent because I wanted 
to live. I wanted to see my then-4- 
month-old daughter grow up. I wanted 
to see my then-2-year-old son grow up. 
That is what we need for this country. 
Choose 100 percent. Choose the way 
for us to succeed as a country and 
march forward. 
When I saw that great doctor, a great 
man from Syria, he told me that story, 
and he gave me his plan for me for my 
treatment. It is now the treatment—it 
was a trial drug that is now the stand-
ard of care for Hodgkin’s lymphoma pa-
tients. But I went and got a second 
opinion, a third opinion, and a fourth 
opinion. Why? Because that is what 
you do, and that is what we should be 
doing right now, listening to all the ex-
perts. 
This body should have hearing after 
hearing, calling in people for the ex-
perts. But we are not having these 
hearings. Why not? Why have we only 
met something like, ballpark, 13 of the 
last 90-something days? Someone ex-
plain that to me. 
Someone explain to me how the 
Founding Fathers in 1793, when 5,000 
out of 50,000 Philadelphians died from 
yellow fever, they found a way to meet 
and have this body meet. Instead, what 
do we get? Proxy voting. 
Do you know what that means, 
American people? We have people on 
boats, calling in to hearings to register 
their votes. Think about that. That is 
not what the Constitution means. 
I am proud to be in court tomorrow, 
litigating that against the Speaker of 
the House. We will be right here in 
court because it is unconstitutional. 
But more important than that, it 
means we are not here leading. We are 
not here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives doing our job and pro-
jecting confidence to the American 
people that we can all meet and do 
what we are supposed to do. 
We should have hearing after hearing 
after hearing, calling epidemiology ex-
perts about what we can do to ensure 
that the American people go back to 
work confidently, go to school, go to 
work, create wealth, create oppor-
tunity, and get back on our feet. 
I am not going to use up much more 
of the gentleman’s time, but I do want 
to say this: This stuff is all related. If

you think the lawlessness on the 
streets of Portland and the dead ba-
bies—Black, White, and otherwise in 
Chicago, New York, and Atlanta; the 8- 
year-old girl who got killed with her 
mom; the gentleman walking across 
the street holding his 8-year-old daugh-
ter’s hand; a Black man and a Black 
girl, he got gunned down in the streets 
of New York; a 1-year-old infant in New 
York; a 3-year-old Black baby boy in 
Chicago; a 19-year-old Black young 
man in a so-called autonomous zone in 
Seattle—they are dead and they are 
gone because of lawlessness, because 
we are refusing to do our job to stand 
up for the very rule of law that sets 
this country apart from the rest of the 
world and always has. That is all re-
lated. 
When you shut your country down, 
Mr. Speaker, the mental impact of that 
is real. And that is not just me. There 
are smart doctors who believe that. 
John Ioannidis, whom I said was 
from 
Stanford 
University, 
asserted 
that extended lockdowns might not be 
the best approach. One of the bottom 
lines is that we don’t know how long 
social 
distancing 
measures 
and 
lockdowns can be maintained without 
major consequences to the economy, 
society, and mental health. 
Ioannidis wrote: ‘‘Unpredictable evo-
lutions may ensue, including financial 
crisis, unrest, civil strife, war, and a 
meltdown of the social fabric.’’ 
I feel extremely sad that my pre-
dictions were verified. 
The leaders of this body, all 435 of us, 
have an obligation to be here to do our 
job, to hold hearings, to speak the 
truth, to seek the truth, and to speak 
the truth to the American people. 
I don’t take it cavalierly. My 77-year- 
old father, I didn’t see him between 
Christmas and July Fourth to protect 
him. My kids are going back to school 
on August 20 in Austin, Texas. 
Do I worry about my family? Of 
course I do. But we are going to get 
back in the saddle, and we are going to 
get back to do our jobs and get this 
country moving forward. 
To my friend from Texas, I am sorry 
I took up too much time. I thank my 
friend for doing this. I love this coun-
try. I will never apologize for loving 
this country, and we are going to work 
together to get this country back in 
the saddle. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, as we 
say in west Texas, amen and amen. I 
could listen to Representative ROY all 
night because he speaks from his heart 
and from a passion for his country and 
for his fellow countrymen. He is a 
truth seeker and a fighter for all that 
is good about this country. 
We are glad the gentleman is here as 
part of the great delegation of Texas. 
We are all better in this body because 
of his presence and his service as a 
Member of Congress. 
May God bless the gentleman. I 
thank him for his words tonight. 
Now, I want to invite another col-
league who is a lover of freedom and a 
great patriot, who is unabashed and 
beaming in his pride for the United 
States of America. 
Mr. ALLEN is another gentleman who 
could be doing a lot of things. He is an 
accomplished businessman who could 
be doing a lot of things and spending a 
lot of quality time with his children 
and grandchildren, but, once again, he 
believes that the best way he can love 
his family and love those grandchildren 
is to hand them a better, stronger, 
safer, and freer United States of Amer-
ica. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the 12th District of Georgia (Mr. 
ALLEN), who is my dear friend. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
holding this special order. 
This is a topic that we need to have 
a family discussion on. This Congress 
needs to sit down together and have a 
family discussion on where we are as a 
nation because I am deeply troubled by 
the state of our Nation, and most of my 
constituents who talk with me on a 
daily basis ask me what in the world is 
going on. 
I go back to my childhood. I grew up 
on a farm, and I learned the value of 
hard work. I tell people that outside of 
this President, my daddy was the hard-
est worker that I have ever known. I 
am not sure he could outwork this 
President. 
Mr. Speaker, my dad was one of five 
people in my county that you would go 
to see if you were going to run for pub-
lic office. That is how much he cared 
about his community; that is how 
much he cared about that county; and 
that is how much he cared about his 
State. 
I will be honest with you. My moth-
er, my brother, my sister, and I would 
get upset with him because he spent 
time doing things outside of the home, 
trying to make our county and our 
State a better place to live. So, one 
day, I asked him about it. 
I said: Dad, why are you so involved 
in public service? 
He said: Son, I grew up in the Great 
Depression, and I fought in World War 
II. And in both times, I really thought 
there was a possibility we were going 
to lose this country. 
I think he made a covenant with God 
that he would do everything he could 
to sustain the great Nation that he had 
the opportunity to grow up in and farm 
and to be involved in education and all 
the amazing work that my father did 
for that community. But he left me 
with this—and my dear friend, RALPH 
NORMAN, talked about this tonight. 
My dad said: Son, you have to under-
stand one thing. Apathy is the enemy 
of freedom. 
b 2015 
You look at voter turnout, and you 
look at folks who say, ‘‘I really don’t 
want to get involved,’’ or, ‘‘I don’t 
want to get out and knock on doors or 
make phone calls.’’ 
Folks, I am going to sound the 
alarm. I am going to sound the alarm 
for a lot of different people groups. 
Take the small business community. 
The small business community gen-
erates about 50 percent of the jobs in 
this country. Seventy percent of all the 
new jobs created in this amazing econ-
omy we had before COVID–19 were gen-
erated by the small business commu-
nity. 
The first reason I ran for Congress 
was because of the war on past admin-
istrations on small business. 
Let me tell you, small business, you 
need to get involved in this process, be-
cause if we aren’t careful, there will be 
another war on small business. 
I came down here today to talk about 
two amendments, and a lot of those 
amendments dealt with the regulatory 
environment that, prior to President 
Trump, was destroying the small busi-
ness community. 
You know, one of the greatest privi-
leges that I have had in my life—and I 
think this is maybe the greatest gift I 
have ever received from God—is the 
privilege to give people the oppor-
tunity to have a good job, to have the 
dignity and respect they deserve, to 
empower them to be what God created 
them to be, and to allow them to pro-
vide for their family, their country, 
and their church. 
There is no greater satisfaction that 
I have found in this country—I have 
not found one person who is unhappy, 
that is not filled with joy when they 
are serving others. And we still have a 
tremendous amount of that going on in 
this country. 
But over the past few months, we 
have seen radical progressive attacks 
on our Nation. What started as legiti-
mate and peaceful protests has since 
been hijacked by violent lawbreakers. 
Now, let’s be clear, the mob wants 
total anarchy. And we are seeing it 
play out before our eyes, and it started 
long before we got here. Now we are ex-
periencing attacks on law enforcement. 
I saw that in my generation on the 
military. 
The destruction of Presidential me-
morials, the establishment of so-called 
autonomous zones. If you ask these 
folks who are destroying these things, 
they don’t even know who they are, but 
all that does is that represents author-
ity. 
Well, I was fortunate almost 20 years 
ago to become—well, I had a spiritual 
awakening, and I began to have this 
thirst for the Bible. And so I began to 
research the Bible and to try to run my 
business and to exhibit leadership 
skills and to deal with the issues of our 
culture based on Biblical history and 
what is going on in the Bible. 
Well, Romans 13 is very clear about 
authority. God ordains all authority. 
And I encourage you to read Romans 
13, because it will tell you and describe 
to you the issues involved with author-
ity and what happens to a nation when 
those who rebel against authority, 
what can happen. 
In fact, I also am involved in many 
Bible studies here in Congress, and it 
has been quite an education for me to

understand what is the relationship be-
tween God and government in our cul-
ture. 
Obviously, we heard tonight that this 
Nation was founded based on people 
who came here seeking religious free-
dom. And so if you look at exactly why 
God ordained government 4,000 years 
ago, it was one thing, and that is to re-
strain evil. That is to deal with anar-
chy. That is to deal with exactly what 
we are faced with right now. 
Mr. Speaker, Members of this body 
are turning away from God. We should 
be one voice here condemning this an-
archy and evil we are seeing across this 
country. 
Well, I believe the best way forward 
is for our State and local governments 
to step up. The Federal Government 
also has a unique role to play. 
Like I said, Speaker PELOSI
and 
Democratic leaders have shown time 
and time again that they would rather 
pass partisan, political messaging bills 
than work with Republicans on bipar-
tisan legislation—like meaningful po-
lice reform. 
My dear friend Senator TIM SCOTT 
has worked tirelessly to provide police 
reform that I believe will work for 
America. The police force needs it. 
They need our support. And I will tell 
you, they have my support. Yes, there 
are going to be bad outcomes. It is the 
human condition. We talked about that 
as well. 
But there should be, at this time in 
the history of our country, under this 
pandemic, unprecedented bipartisan-
ship. But, clearly, over the last few 
weeks, it shows that we would rather 
appease those on what we term the rad-
ical left than work toward a more per-
fect Union. 
Please, my friends, please, America, 
wake up. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
across the aisle realize sooner than 
later that appeasing the mob will never 
stop. It will never be enough. It is just 
like government funding. I have seen 
that in reality with this pandemic. It is 
a feeding frenzy, and we are seeing it 
play out right before our eyes here. 
And let me tell you something: We 
need to look and try to look into the 
future. Say, for example, if we were 
born today, when we look back and un-
derstand why we are leaving our chil-
dren and grandchildren—and I don’t 
know how many generations—400, 500 
years—the obligation of this debt. I 
don’t know of any nation in history 
that has done something like that. I 
mean, that in itself is a crisis. 
Yet we are continuing to explode the 
debt. When I saw the appropriations 
package, I could not believe it. We are 
trying to fight the pandemic. Yes, we 
have created a lot of debt to deal with 
that, and, yes, you are going to have to 
deal with emergencies. But just to go 
and spend money that you don’t have? 
People say, well, this is taxpayer 
money. This is not taxpayer money, 
folks. This is maybe 400 to 500 years 
down the road. Now, how are you going 
to explain that to your children and 
grandchildren? 
Mr. Speaker, there are seven influ-
ences in our culture: There is the 
church. There is family. There is edu-
cation. There is arts and entertain-
ment. There is the media. There is the 
government. And there is the business. 
And where do those influences stand 
today? 
The church has been mitigated. Our 
Founders—yes, they didn’t do it per-
fect, but let me tell you, the church 
was a tremendous influence in the 
founding of this country. When they 
couldn’t agree, they brought in the 
great ministers. And the ministers 
would reveal the Scriptures and tell 
those Founders: This is how you come 
together. 
We don’t have that here. I have never 
heard somebody stand up and say: This 
is what the Scripture says and this is 
why we need to come together, and this 
is how we need to move forward. 
I did say on this House floor in a Spe-
cial Order on Bible Week that I believe 
that the Bible has an answer to every 
problem we have got, if we just re-
searched it and we had someone to 
come down and tell us how we should 
go. There are profits everywhere. We 
listen to them on Sunday mornings. 
Come on, folks, we need wise counsel. 
Then there is the family. The family 
has been devastated. Fifty percent of 
the children in this country are born in 
single-parent homes. I don’t blame 
children for being angry. And single 
moms, I tell you, my heart goes out to 
them. 
Education, you know, we took the 
values that God gave us out of the edu-
cation system, and we are seeing the 
fruits of that right now. 
Arts and entertainment are sup-
porting everything out there that, 
frankly, is very difficult for us to un-
derstand. The media, the media is so 
biased today. 
The government, the government is 
trying to fix everything. Let me tell 
you, the more problems we have in this 
society, the more this government has 
got to spend. Folks, there is not 
enough money in the world to fix a cul-
ture in anarchy. It won’t work. 
The business community, the busi-
ness community is under siege. Like I 
said, the reason I ran for Congress is 
there was a war on small business. 
Big business, I will tell you, I am dis-
appointed in some of these large com-
panies that are buying in to some of 
these things that we see today—the an-
archy, the other things. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is time in 
America that we stand up and defend 
the Nation we love. And those who 
wish to harm it—yes, people ask me: 
Do you think we are under God’s judg-
ment? 
I say: No, I think that would be a lot 
more difficult than what we are seeing 
right now. 
When you are under the judgment of 
God, you have got to look back at what 
Israel went through. But I can tell you 
this. God could have stopped this pan-
demic like that. God can stop this an-
archy like that. But God has removed 
his protection, in my opinion, from 
this Nation. And until we repent from 
our evil ways and confess our sin, then 
God will heal our land, and that is the 
only hope that we have. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague and brother in Christ speaks 
the truth. And as I said, we can pass all 
the 
laws 
we 
want, 
Representative 
ALLEN, but we cannot pass laws that 
change the human heart. 
We must return to those core values, 
to that relationship with God to re-
member that the greatest command-
ment is to love God with all your 
heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to 
love your neighbor. And it is hard to 
find a lot of love in this world today. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining on my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 13 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the 
rise of socialism in this country is real. 
Probably in times past it was used hy-
perbolically against Big Government, 
liberals, but it is real, and it is hard to 
believe that such a destructive system 
of government and deceptive ideology 
has 
become 
mainstream 
in 
these 
United States. This beacon of freedom, 
this great experiment—not accident, 
but experiment—and liberty and de-
mocracy. 
How do I know? Because people don’t 
put their name to legislation on behalf 
of the 800,000 to a million American 
citizens they represent if they don’t 
mean it. 
b 2030 
H.R. 1 through H.R. 10 are just more 
government control, less freedom to 
we, the people, government takeover of 
elections, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
takeover of healthcare, taking over ag-
riculture and energy and government 
seeping into every facet of our lives. 
One of our central values, as we 
think about the defense of American 
values, is the value of freedom. And the 
central purpose of government is to 
protect our freedom. The central tenet 
of our democratic republic is that sov-
ereignty resides, not in the State, but 
in we, the people. 
There has been no other nation in the 
world, in the history of the world, that 
has done more because of that powerful 
force of freedom that elevates and 
unleashes the human spirit like noth-
ing in the world, save and except the 
love of God, and no other country that 
holds freedom in such high regard and 
puts such a premium on freedom, on 
liberty, has done more to lift people 
out of poverty, to protect human rights 
and fundamental God-given freedoms. 
No other nation has raised the stand-
ard of living or contributed to the qual-
ity of life, not only in this Nation, but 
in nations around the world, like the 
United States of America.

And I would submit, Mr. Speaker, 
that in large part, outside—save and 
except the providential hand and favor 
of Almighty God, that God that my 
colleague, Representative RICK ALLEN, 
implored us to return to, to repent and 
return and cry out for mercy—save and 
except for that, it has been freedom. 
And this freedom is a remarkable 
thing. It is an attribute, it is a privi-
lege, it is a responsibility, and people 
are literally risking their lives today— 
people will die this week just trying to 
get here. 
They are not trying to get into Ven-
ezuela. They are not trying to get into 
Cuba. God bless those people and the 
poor citizens of those countries that 
don’t have what we have that empow-
ers us to be the envy of the world. And 
that is a tremendous responsibility. 
And there is no doubt that is a core 
value. And I say: How are we losing 
this? How do we actually have a de-
bate, a sincere debate, a legitimate de-
bate, about government control, cen-
tral planning, socialism as an ideology 
and as a system of government, when 
we have the backdrop of all of this his-
tory? 
No, it is not perfect. We were striving 
for a more perfect Union. Imperfect 
people striving for a more perfect 
Union. And that is the legacy that has 
been handed to us. That is our mission 
and our calling. 
I think about the erosion of the val-
ues we have talked about this evening. 
I think about the entitlement culture 
that we have created. I say ‘‘we.’’ I say 
Republicans and Democrats alike. We 
continue to expand the government as 
the answer to all that ails us, as the so-
lution to every problem, with no regard 
for the cost and consequence. 
$23 trillion before COVID; $4 trillion 
by the end of this year added on top of 
it. We will surpass our highest debt 
load per GDP in the history of this 
great Nation. Not since World War II 
have we been up over 108 percent debt- 
to-GDP. That is where we are heading. 
And we have done that, and it has 
been at no cost. We don’t hit anybody’s 
pocketbook, and we don’t cut some-
one’s pet project and their favorite pro-
gram to offset the cost. 
So why wouldn’t people think you 
can get everything for free? Why 
wouldn’t we have created a generation 
of Americans that think things are 
really free, at no cost? 
Well, there will be a rude awaking 
when the chickens come home to roost 
with respect to our fiscal affairs, be-
cause this $27–$28 trillion, on our way, 
is a deferred tax on our children. And it 
is unconscionable. It is immoral. And 
it is un-American for a generation of 
leaders to do that to our posterity. 
On top of that, we have had the tyr-
anny of usurpation of the will of the 
people. Listen, let’s debate issues of 
immigration, let’s debate all issues, 
and may the will of the people prevail. 
That is the way it works. Not by execu-
tive fiat, not by judicial activism, 
some judge making the determination 
of what is best. The people know 
what’s best. 
I believe that that government fiat 
and the tyranny of unelected bureau-
crats and judges making policy deci-
sions is another way we have acceler-
ated the decline of this country, and we 
have moved away from these values. 
I think now we are seeing maybe an-
other phase of this. Mob tyranny, peo-
ple running around in the streets de-
stroying property, assaulting police of-
ficers and law-abiding citizens. It is 
just a free-for-all. No law, no order; 
chaos. 
And our great American cities are 
just burning, I believe, in large part, 
because our local leaders in these cit-
ies, they are scared because they have 
been intimidated. And that is how the 
mob works, through fear and intimida-
tion, and nobody is standing up to 
them. 
But the people who have the re-
sources, the people who are law-abiding 
contributors to those cities, and the 
best employers, they will eventually 
leave. But the poorest among our fel-
low countrymen in those cities, they 
can’t go anywhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the President is 
doing exactly what he should do. I am 
very sensitive to government interven-
tion, and I think it is a very delicate 
thing when you intervene in civil af-
fairs. That is a local and State issue. 
But when you have this kind of mob 
violence that is unabated, when you 
have systems of law enforcement and 
local leaders that are overwhelmed and 
either unwilling or incapable of stop-
ping it and you are risking the lives of 
our fellow Americans and their rights 
are being trampled and local law en-
forcement and Federal law enforce-
ment officers are being assaulted and 
our buildings are being burned, Mr. 
Speaker, we have got to do something. 
There is an appropriate way to en-
gage, and this President has done that, 
through civil law enforcement officers 
of this Government to go protect that 
property, to protect those law enforce-
ment and other Federal personnel, and 
to come alongside the local law en-
forcement there in Portland and Se-
attle so that they can keep some sem-
blance of order and protection for their 
people. Because the local leaders have 
completely abdicated it. 
And Americans all over are just 
scratching their heads and their hearts 
are breaking and they are tremen-
dously concerned about what happens. 
And there is one thought that you just 
let it all burn to the ground, and that 
will be the lesson for Americans all 
over this country, in cities and commu-
nities, all over this country. We could 
do that. 
Or we could say: You know what? 
Those are American citizens, by God. 
Those are American citizens, and no-
body is coming to their help. 
I hope we support this President as 
he is taking a measured approach to 
come alongside those local law enforce-
ment officers who have been totally 
disrespected, dismissed, and either par-
tially 
defunded 
or 
significantly 
defunded, and certainly hamstrung to 
do their job. 
You watch as these criminals shoot 
fireworks in their faces and as they 
rough them up and call them names. It 
is just a sad scenario for a Nation as 
great as ours. 
We are big enough to have the pro-
tests. That is as American as apple pie. 
Peaceful assembly, peaceful protest, 
speaking your truth to power, that is 
what made this country great. But 
what we are seeing in Seattle and Port-
land must stop. And we all must con-
demn it, Mr. Speaker. 
And as for me, I stand with this 
President, and I say use every re-
source—use every resource in civil law 
enforcement to keep the peace, to pro-
tect our citizens and protect the tax-
payers’ Federal property in all these 
cities where their local leaders have 
completely lost control. 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for the indul-
gence tonight, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
We acknowledge today, O Lord, Your 
power, mercy, and grace. We need Your 
power, for the challenges we face re-
quire more than human wisdom. We 
need Your mercy, for we transgress 
Your love and fall short of Your glory. 
We need Your grace, for we cannot 
offer anything to merit Your favor or 
gain Your love. 
Lord, empower our Senators for to-

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask

WELLES DECLARATION 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
this very day in 1940, Acting Secretary 
of State Sumner Welles issued a state-
ment outlining U.S. policy toward the 
Soviet Union’s annexation of the Baltic 
States. It began: ‘‘During these past 
few 
days 
the 
devious 
processes 
whereunder the political independence 
and territorial integrity of the three 
small Baltic Republics—Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania—were to be delib-
erately annihilated by one of their 
more powerful neighbors, have been 
rapidly drawing to their conclusion.’’ 
It expressed the sympathy of the peo-
ple of the United States for democratic 
self-government and, at the same time, 
articulated the policy of the United 
States to oppose predatory activities 
using force or the threat of force or 
any intervention in the affairs of an-
other sovereign state. The United 
States continued to recognize the sov-
ereignty of the Baltic States through-
out about 50 years of Soviet occupa-
tion. 
Things that go around come around. 
Now we have a historical footnote. 
Vladimir Putin has been trying to re-
write this history for his own devious 
purposes—reverting to the absurd So-
viet claim that the Baltics in 1940 
joined the Soviet Union voluntarily. 
There are also clear parallels we 
ought to take notice of to this current 
Russian occupation of parts of the Re-
public of Georgia and the Ukraine. The 
principles in Secretary of State Welles’ 
Declaration are as relevant today as 
they were 80 years ago. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
another issue—and more current—ear-
lier this year, after the longest eco-
nomic expansion in U.S. history, the 
government told the American people 
to stay home and businesses to close— 
the first time in 240 years of our coun-
try. Countless lives have been saved be-
cause Americans heeded their govern-
ment’s call. And at the same time, 
whether they wanted to or not, they 
were sacrificing for their fellow Ameri-
cans. 
There is no doubt that containing 
this virus has caused economic pain 
not seen since the Great Depression. 
Hopefully, we are racing toward a vac-
cine answer to this pandemic. In the 
meantime, Americans must continue 
to sacrifice, just as previous genera-
tions did for the sake of their neigh-
bors, families, friends, and loved ones. 
Make no mistake, we will beat this 
virus, and the United States of Amer-
ica will emerge stronger and even more 
prosperous than before. 
Today, Senate Republicans, hope-
fully, will unveil an unprecedented ex-
pansion of previous assistance to help 
our country get through this crisis. As 
Finance Committee chairman, I look 
forward to introducing further assist-
ance to individuals, relief for workers 
and employers, support for patients, 
providers, and foster youth, and addi-
tional flexibilities for State and local 
governments to fight this disease and 
the economic pain that has come be-
fore it. 
I call on my colleagues to, once 
again, work together and not let par-
tisan politics or gamesmanship get in 
the way of delivering for the American 
people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4434 
July 23, 2020 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, faced 
with the greatest economic challenge 
in 75 years and the greatest public 
health threat in a century, we Senate 
Democrats 
have 
been 
waiting 
for 
months for our Republican colleagues 
in the Senate to get serious about an-
other round of emergency relief for the 
American people. 
Now that Senate Republicans have fi-
nally woken up to the calamity in our 
country, they have given up wishing it 
would go away, following the Presi-
dent’s wishing everything would go 
away, to the detriment of this country. 
Our Republican colleagues have been so 
divided, so disorganized, and so unpre-
pared that they have to struggle to 
draft even a partisan proposal within 
their own conference. This is before 
they talk to a single Democrat. This is 
before they even consider what the 
House has done. 
It does seem that sometime soon, Re-
publicans may finally unveil a legisla-
tive proposal, but because they are so 
disorganized and divided, they can’t 
agree on a series of smaller bills that 
don’t even amount to one coherent pro-
posal. Even after all this time, it ap-
pears the Republican legislative re-
sponse 
to 
COVID 
is 
ununified, 
unserious, unsatisfactory. Let me re-
peat that. Despite hitting the ‘‘pause’’ 
button on the Senate for 3 months, de-
spite waiting more than 60 days after 
the House Democrats passed their plan 
to start work on their own, the Senate 
Republican 
response 
to 
COVID 
is 
ununified, unsatisfactory, and, fun-
damentally, unserious. 
From what we know, their proposal 
or series of proposals will not include 
food assistance for hungry kids. Fami-
lies where the parent has lost a job 
through no fault of her or his own can’t 
feed their kids in this proposal, as we 
hear about it. 
From what we know, it will not in-
clude rental assistance or extend the 
moratorium on evictions that is keep-
ing tens of millions of Americans with 
a roof over their heads. Millions of 
Americans have lost their jobs through 
no fault of their own. They can’t pay 
the rent or the mortgage, and our Re-
publican friends say: Evict them. 
It will not provide hazard pay to our 
essential workers, who have been risk-
ing their lives and their families’ lives 
ever since this crisis began. It will not 
make the necessary investments in 
communities of color that have been 
ravaged by this virus disproportion-
ately so. It will not provide the new 
funding that State and local govern-
ments need to keep the busdrivers and 
sanitation workers, teachers, and so 
many others on the job. From what we 
know, it will not even include funding 
to ensure that our elections are safe 
this fall during this COVID crisis. 
Remarkably, the likely centerpiece 
of the Republican legislative response 
to COVID is not an aid package for the 
20 to 30 million unemployed Americans 
or a massive influx of resources to test 
and trace and finally stop the spread of 
this evil disease. The centerpiece of the 
Republican 
proposal 
is 
a 
liability 
shield to protect big corporations from 
lawsuits if they put their workers at 
risk—seriously. As COVID continues to 
surge throughout our country and un-
employment numbers rose again for 
the first time in weeks, Leader MCCON-
NELL has made corporate immunity the 
centerpiece of this Republican re-
sponse. Once again, the Republican 
Senate is far more comfortable pro-
viding relief to big corporations than 
relief to American workers and Amer-
ican families. 
How about instead of shielding cor-
porations from liability, we shield 
renters from eviction? How about in-
stead of shielding corporations from li-
ability, we shield the unemployed from 
poverty? 
Even in those areas where the Senate 
Republicans seem to be moving a bit in 
our direction, it looks like they are 
coming up way short. Republicans 
aren’t talking about providing enough 
resources for our schools to reopen 
safely. According to reports, the White 
House and Senate Republicans want to 
extend the enhanced unemployment 
benefits the Democrats secured in the 
CARES Act but only provide a percent-
age of a worker’s former wage. 
That is right, America. If you have 
lost your job through no fault of your 
own and can’t go back to work because 
this administration has mismanaged 
the crisis, Republicans want you to 
take a 30-percent pay cut in the middle 
of this crisis. 
Worse 
still, 
because 
Republicans 
dithered and delayed for so long, there 
will be an interruption in unemploy-
ment benefits. Eviction protections 
will expire no matter what we do be-
cause they waited until the last minute 
and, even at this last minute, can’t 
seem to get their act together. 
Leader MCCONNELL and Senate Re-
publicans dismissed the House-passed 
Heroes Act because it included a few 
items that Republicans didn’t think 
were absolutely necessary. 
Senate Republicans can’t even get 
their act together to provide the ba-
sics—food for kids, keeping Americans 
in their homes, preventing the unem-
ployed from going into poverty, and 
giving the economy the needed help so 
we can overcome this recession. 
You can’t say you support essential 
workers and then refuse to give them 
hazard pay. You can’t say you want to 
fix racial issues and then throw mil-
lions of Americans of color out of hous-
ing and off unemployment benefits dur-
ing a pandemic. You can’t say you 
want to honor John Lewis and then 
refuse to provide funding for safe elec-
tions. 
Congress needs to act quickly, but 
the developing Republican proposals 
are not going to get the job done. We 
need to immediately enter bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiations to develop a 
proposal that actually meets the mo-
ment and matches the scale of the cri-
sis. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
for the opportunity to address the issue 
before us. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, across 
America, crowds have been assembling, 
saying: This is a moment in which we 
must not only have a national con-
versation about public safety and rac-
ism, but we need action. We need to 
change the scenario that exists in so 
many places where public safety de-
partments have seen one group of citi-
zens in a community as their clients 
and another group of citizens as the 
threat, which leads to systemic racism, 
differences in approach depending on 
the color of the skin of the person that 
you are dealing with. It may be as sim-
ple as saying: Let’s stop that person. 
They have dark skin, and they are 
driving through this neighborhood, and 
maybe they don’t belong here. Let’s 
stop that person because they have 
dark skin, and maybe they are dealing 
drugs. 
That 
is 
systemic 
racism 
and 
profiling. 
This is a discussion about what value 
we should aim for here in America. 
That value is that every member of the 
community is a client; that there is 
the goal of providing equal public safe-
ty services to all and treating each and 
every person the same regardless of the 
color of their skin; and to have each 
public safety officer say ‘‘How would I 
respond differently if I saw three young 
teenagers running toward a house and 
they were Black rather than White?’’ 
and taking that into account and say-
ing ‘‘Would it change that? Would I re-
spond the same?’’ 
They are all our clients. We are here 
to serve everyone. That is the national 
discussion. 
People 
come 
into 
the 
streets and protest. 
This is a group of African-American, 
Black American protesters in Oregon. 
One of them is wearing a T-shirt saying 
‘‘We March, we sit down, we speak up, 
we die.’’ 
When I read that, I was thinking 
about the experience I had a number of 
years ago when a Black American was 
working with me rebuilding a house, 
helping me out for a few weeks. We 
went out into suburban Maryland. This 
was back in the 1980s. We were trying 
to find a particular part or piece of 
equipment. We didn’t know where that 
speciality store was. We pulled up next 
to a sheriff. The sheriff’s car had two 
White sheriffs in it and a shotgun 
propped up between the seats. 
I said to my friend: Hey, roll down 
your window and ask those sheriffs 
where this place is. 
He started to roll down the window. 
He looked over and saw the two White 
sheriffs with the gun between them, 
and he never said a word. He just 
turned back. He looked straight ahead, 
and he looked terrified. 
I saw those sheriffs as people who 
work for me—who should work for ev-
eryone—and we could ask them for 
their help. He saw them as people 
who—if he started a dialogue with 
them, he might end up in deep trouble, 
in physical harm. That is what this 
conversation is about. That is what we 
are seeking to change in America. 
This idea of protesting for change is 
as American as apple pie. This is as 
American as the American Revolution, 
people standing up and saying: This is 
not right. Freedom of speech and free-
dom of assembly are core values of 
what it means to be a ‘‘we the people’’ 
republic. 
These 
protesters—often 
African 
American, often of many races—have 
been coming together. There have been 
some folks—often younger folks—who 
have come to cause a bit of trouble 
that goes beyond simple protesting. 
We had a challenge in Portland of 
White extremists—often dressing in 
camouflage, antifa members who are 
looking for a fight—conflicting, often 
late at night. Portland has worked 
very hard to deescalate that situa-
tion—to deescalate it, to empower the 
message that the protesters are bring-
ing about restructuring systemic rac-
ism, ending systemic racism. These 
acts, these conflicts, take away from 
that message. 
As they worked so hard to deesca-
late, along came President Trump. 
Trump had a different objective: He 
wanted to escalate violence on the

streets of Portland. I can tell you, 
there is a huge difference between pro-
testing and making your message 
known and respecting that and having 
a government that respects it. It is our 
government, our ‘‘we the people’’ gov-
ernment. And this a government—an 
Executive in the Oval Office who de-
ploys Federal forces to create chaos 
and violence and to attack peaceful 
protesters. 
I have come to the floor twice in the 
last 2 days to go through and show the 
camouflaged, battle-ready troops de-
ployed by Trump who are coming in a 
secret fashion, eliminating any indica-
tion of whom they work for. Are they 
Customs and Border Protection? Are 
they Federal Protective Service? Are 
they U.S. Marshals? They have no iden-
tity and have stripped all their unique 
identifiers, which means they can club 
a peaceful protester, they can shoot 
them in the head, and nobody knows 
who did it because there is no ID on 
their uniform. There is no account-
ability and no discipline and out-
rageous attacks on peaceful protesters. 
I was here speaking yesterday, and I 
asked for consideration be given on 
this floor for my amendment to end se-
cret policing. It is a very simple 
amendment that says: You wear identi-
fication of your agency. You wear a 
unique identifier. You don’t go outside 
your mission of protecting a Federal 
building unless you are in partnership 
with a Governor or a mayor. It is that 
simple. So simple. 
But my Republican colleague came 
down and objected to consideration of 
this amendment. I think, in essence, he 
didn’t believe the story I am pre-
senting. He didn’t believe the story I 
am telling you about peaceful pro-
testers being attacked. Maybe because 
it is so outside the conception of what 
a President would do, the thought is 
just hard to acknowledge, that we have 
a President who embraces this secret 
police strategy of assaulting peaceful 
protesters and grabbing people out of 
the crowd and throwing them into un-
marked vans. It is hard to imagine. 
It is hard to imagine a President of 
the United States admiring authori-
tarian dictators across the planet, but 
we have a President who admires the 
authoritarian dictator-style tactics of 
Duterte in the Philippines and who ad-
mires the Crown Prince, who assas-
sinated and dismembered an American- 
based reporter for the Washington 
Post. We have a President who admires 
Putin, who crushes the civil rights of 
his people. We have a President who 
admires 
the 
strong-arm 
tactics 
Erdogan is employing in Turkey. That 
is what we have. Until now, he didn’t 
bring the secret police to the streets of 
America; now he has. 
I am going to try a different way of 
conveying what is going on and do it in 
the voices of women who were there at 
the protests 2 nights ago to try to con-
vey what is happening on the streets of 
Portland and how terribly, terribly 
wrong it is. 
The message ‘‘All Mothers Were 
Summoned When He Called Out to His 
Mama’’ is a reference to George Floyd 
dying with a policeman’s knee on his 
neck, cutting off either his air or his 
carotid artery, blood supply to his 
brain or both, killing him. So mamas 
have responded. They said: Let’s go 
join the protesters as well. Surely this 
is not the case, that they are attacking 
peaceful protesters. 
They formed a group who went down, 
and they did things like dancing and 
chanting and handing out flowers, like 
this woman here. Isn’t she beautiful? 
She is coming down, holding a sun-
flower. Others were holding mums. 
It is unimaginable that a President 
of the United States would send Fed-
eral troops to attack women like this, 
holding peaceful flowers and dancing 
and singing in the streets. But they 
were scared because they knew that 
peaceful protesters had been attacked 
previously, so some of them wore gog-
gles, and some of them wore bike hel-
mets. 
But let’s hear from the women in 
their own words. Two of these women 
work on my team. I didn’t know they 
were going to go down. I didn’t know 
until last night that they had gone 
down the previous night, that they had 
been there. They had experiences, and 
they chose to share their experiences. I 
have maybe another five or six things 
that women wrote up about their expe-
riences and posted them. I will try to 
share those, reading it in their voice. 
The 
first 
one 
is 
from 
Stacey 
Jochimsen: 
I joined the Wall of Moms in Portland on 
Tuesday night to support black and brown 
Americans and voice my concerns about po-
lice violence in our city. I showed up in cut 
off shorts and a yellow shirt—the identifier 
for the Portland Wall of Moms—I was wear-
ing sneakers and carrying yellow mums and 
sunflowers that other moms had gifted me 
on my way in. 
We participated in hours of dancing, chant-
ing, and singing. It was a beautiful protest 
on a warm Oregon night. I saw no violence, 
I felt safe. We were demanding change. We 
were standing up for our black and brown 
brothers and sisters; we were there to am-
plify their voices. Was there graffiti? Sure 
there was. Graffiti is not violence. 
At around 11 p.m., the Wall of Moms was 
called to the front of the federal courthouse. 
We went. We stood—arms linked—facing the 
building, creating a wall of protection be-
tween protesters and the building. We were 
moms called to use our privilege to keep oth-
ers safe, and we tried. 
While we stood, arms linked, officers in fa-
tigues and gas masks (we assume were fed-
eral, they were unidentified) rushed from the 
building and from behind us. There was no 
warning. They took a woman to the ground 
and hog-tied her on the steps of the Court-
house. They swiped at cell phones and yelled 
at us from behind gas masks. They pointed 
weapons at us. Us. We were non-violent, 
peaceful demonstrators. We were moms in 
Converse sneakers holding flowers. I am still 
trembling at the sight of their weapons 
pointed at us. I have never felt so threatened 
and unsafe as I did at that moment. I had the 
realization that these officers really are not 
here to protect, they are here to harm. Were 
we going to be shot? Would I be struck in the 
head by a canister? Am I going to make it 
home to my children? 
We held our line as they threw flashbangs 
and shot tear gas canisters at us. I was 
peaceful, I was standing still and holding 
hands with women around me—surely they 
would not shoot at me. I could feel the 
women on both sides of me trembling. The 
officers pointed their weapons at us. I put 
my hands in the air and begged them not to 
hurt us. They shot more tear gas. The tear 
gas overwhelmed us—the pain was unimagi-
nable. It burned my eyes, my throat, my 
skin. I did not bring goggles or a helmet to 
this protest. I wore a tank top and shorts. 
Why would I need a helmet and goggles at a 
peaceful protest? 
I coughed to the point of vomiting. We ran. 
Fellow protesters came to us with water bot-
tles and helped clean our eyes. Another 
brought wipes to clean our skin. We coughed, 
we vomited, and we cried. 
Today, I am still shaking. I cannot focus. 
I am scared. I am jumping at loud noises. My 
heart is racing simply recalling the events of 
last night. I am worried about what the fed-
eral officers are going to do to my fellow Or-
egonians tonight. 
Let me be clear: there was violence on 
Tuesday night, but none of it was from pro-
testers. The only violence I encountered that 
night was from federal police officers. 
I am grateful that I made it home to my 
kids last night. Others were not so fortunate. 
Thank you, Stacey, for sharing your 
firsthand account of the night before 
last—Tuesday night—on the streets of 
Portland, when Federal officers at-
tacked peaceful demonstrators, where 
there was no violence except the vio-
lence of the officers on the protesters. 
This next recounting is from Amy 
Bacher. 
She writes: 
Pre-protest normalcy. There are people 
hanging out in a downtown park by the Jus-
tice Center. They are wearing masks, play-
ing music, and, thanks to Riot Ribs, eating 
free food. The Wall of Moms gathers a short 
distance from there, where they hand out 
sunflowers and yellow carnations. Protective 
gear is also distributed, like helmets, due to 
issues with the Federal police firing ammu-
nition. Medics hand out water and other 
safety gear to everyone to try to keep pro-
testers safe. 
Usually, about a few hours into the pro-
tests, the secret police come out. It is un-
clear who they are now because there are no 
markings for what unit—who they are with— 
and they fire at the protesters. When it was 
the Portland Police Bureau, they were al-
lowed to have their badges covered. 
My experience yesterday included the fol-
lowing: About 2,000 people gathered, chanted, 
gave speeches, and danced in the blocks in 
front of the Justice Center and Federal 
Building in the name of Black Lives Matter. 
People were serious about wearing masks. A 
small, white plane circled the protest area 
repeatedly. It appeared to be the same or 
similar aircraft of the plane that circled ear-
lier protests around Revolution Hall. There 
were a few protesters trying to block a door 
of the Federal Building and post graffiti. One 
of the chants we shouted in front of the Fed-
eral Building was, ‘‘Tell me what democracy 
looks like.’’ Then ‘‘this is what democracy 
looks like.’’ We were all using our voices. 
The next moment, though, about 15 to 20 
large men in camouflage and military gear 
appeared like they were ready for war. They 
had no name tags or identifiers. We had no 
idea if they were soldiers, what branch they 
were from, or why they were there. Almost 
all of them were holding pepper spray guns

and looked like they had customized side-
arms. They stood under the eaves of the Fed-
eral Building. The Wall of Moms were there 
in yellow T-shirts, stretch pants, and sneak-
ers, basically. There was a long line—more 
than a block long—facing the Federal Build-
ing. We were trying to stand in front of all 
the other protesters who had already been 
gassed for some 50-plus days, thinking that 
Trump’s military would not fire on moms. 
We were wrong. There was no ask by officers 
in front of us to step back, move, or do any-
thing at all. The officers started kicking tear 
gas directly at us, shoving a nearby mom in 
the neck, and pepper-spraying another mom 
in the face at close range. 
I had not been tear-gassed before and can’t 
believe that it’s allowed, especially with 
such frequency. It produces violent and im-
mediate bodily reactions and should not be 
used on peaceful protesters. There is a near- 
immediate reaction. You can’t see without 
pain of blinking. It feels like you are inhal-
ing fire into your lungs and like your skin is 
being burned. My lungs are still burning 24 
hours later. These are weapons of war that 
should not be used on Portlanders exercising 
their constitutional right to freedom or as-
sembly. If, after 54 days, officers are still 
using these weapons of war and it is not 
working, we should be asking why—why they 
are still deemed effective or legal. Just be-
fore the first tear gas was thrown, three to 
four of the other officers tackled a woman to 
the ground and hog-tied her. We didn’t see 
where she was taken. At least four women 
were arrested from that group. 
Then she gives a reference to the 
story on the web and how to find it. 
She also notes that Federal agents pep-
per-sprayed the first aid tent, which 
could be a crime when done in war. 
Federal agents went by the Riot Ribs free 
food cart in the park and pepper-sprayed the 
food and the grilles. 
That is where she ends her com-
mentary. 
Thank you very much, Amy, for shar-
ing your story of what happened the 
night before last. 
I hope that all of America is recog-
nizing that what we would never con-
ceive of happening in America is hap-
pening—Federal agents, Federal offi-
cers, being deployed to attack peaceful 
protests. As these two women point 
out, there was graffiti, but it was not 
violent. 
From one of the other letters I am 
about to read, I note: 
There were young folks pounding on the 
plywood that covers the doors of the Federal 
Building, but that, too, wasn’t violent. The 
only violence came from the Federal officers. 
This next story was posted by Krista. 
She writes: 
So the nonviolent Wall of Moms just got 
gassed for absolutely no reason. 
Then she puts in the tags ‘‘PDX pro-
test’’ and ‘‘Black Lives Matter.’’ 
I don’t need cookies for being there. 
Please. I have the privilege of taking the 
night off to let my lungs rest. Black and 
Brown people don’t get to change their skin 
color to take a break from systemic and per-
sonal racism. Also, Black women have been 
on the frontlines for decades. The Wall of 
Moms is getting a lot of attention, but we 
are not the story. Abolishing racist systems 
and ending police brutality against people of 
color is the real story. 
If you want to get involved but aren’t able 
to go downtown, please consider making a 
donation to ‘‘Don’t Shoot Portland.’’ 
Honestly, the leaf blowers helped so much 
on Monday. I was wishing that the dads 
would come out in force again Tuesday be-
cause the moms got gassed bad. It was bru-
tal. I am still coughing and burning 4 hours 
later. 
Come on, dads. Until we have meaningful 
change, the protests will continue. Don’t 
give up yet. 
Krista makes a point that I want to 
accentuate time and again: Black 
Americans have been protesting, put-
ting their lives at risk night after 
night after night—all kinds of pro-
testers coming together and all kinds 
of skin color coming together in order 
to say Black lives matter and that we 
have to end systemic racism. 
My colleague is here to speak. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank my colleague from Or-
egon for his eloquence and for the 
power of his remarks. He speaks not 
only for Oregon but for America. He 
speaks for every one of our commu-
nities and States that ought to fear 
this overreach. It was, indeed, one of 
the main fears of our Founding Fathers 
that the misuse and abuse of our mili-
tary and policing power—of violating 
fundamental rights—would encroach 
on our basic liberties. 
Now, let’s be very real. Federal forces 
were used before to restore order in the 
face of violence after the Rodney King 
incident, after the killing of Martin 
Luther King in 1968, in Little Rock in 
1957, in Oxford, MS, in 1962, and in 
going further back in our history, after 
the Pullman Strike and after the De-
troit race riots in 1943, but this time is 
different. This time is fundamentally 
different. 
As my colleague has so powerfully 
described from the descriptions and the 
photographs that he has brought to the 
Senate floor, what we have here is not 
some violent encroachment by one 
group against another and not just 
some use of violence. We have peaceful 
protests. In fact, the purpose and effect 
of the use of Federal forces here has 
been to incite and fuel violence. It was 
the same purpose that Richard Nixon 
sought to use Federal force when pro-
testers against the Vietnam war came 
to Washington. It was Richard Nixon 
who said that law and order was the po-
litical issue of his day, but the use of 
Federal forces here is not to restore 
order or to enforce the law. It is, in-
stead, to incite lawbreaking and vio-
lence. 
What is different also is the use of 
unidentified, military-like forces. We 
have seen a growth over the past years 
in the form of such forces that are 
available to the President to use. The 
Customs and Border Patrol, the De-
partment of Transportation, and other 
agencies have militarized Federal law 
enforcement agents. They have put 
them in camouflage, and they have 
given them armaments. They have 
taught them tactics that, in effect, 
turn them into military-style forces. 
They have become secret police when 
they are unidentified. They are like the 
little, green men in Russia who show 
up at demonstrations and throw people 
into vans to disappear them. That is 
what they have been doing in Oregon. 
So whereas before the National Guard 
might have been called out as a show of 
force to restore order, now we have a 
perniciously different use of military 
force in the name of law enforcement. 
I will say, as someone whose career 
as a U.S. attorney and then as an at-
torney general for 20 years was in-
volved in law enforcement, 
I 
am 
ashamed and embarrassed to use, in ef-
fect, secret police in this way, sup-
posedly in the name of law enforce-
ment but, in reality, as a political tool. 
If you have any doubt about the polit-
ical purposes here, just watch the lat-
est Trump ads, which are the other side 
of this coin—raising fear, exhorting 
people to panic, and then responding on 
the streets in communities with this 
excessive use of force. 
Exactly what our Founding Fathers 
feared was this unchecked use of mili-
tary power. That is why the bill that 
my colleague from Oregon has intro-
duced and that I have cosponsored is so 
very important, because there must be 
a check. Accountability is vital. Iden-
tification is key. People need to know 
who these people of law enforcement 
supposedly are, and we need account-
ability from them. 
We also need accountability through 
the Insurrection Act. In having been 
joined by many of my colleagues, I 
have offered a bill, the CIVIL Act, that 
would apply these same checks on the 
President’s power as apply when the 
President uses military abroad. He 
must be accountable to Congress. He 
must come to Congress and explain the 
purposes and the reasons for his use of 
military power. He should have no 
more leeway when he uses troops 
abroad than he would at home and vice 
versa. If he uses American troops 
against American citizens, he ought to 
be accountable no less than when he 
uses them abroad. The same is true of 
this policing power. 
The importance of this moment can-
not be underestimated. It is a moment 
of reckoning for racial justice, but for 
justice in our entire country. I believe 
that we must act on both sides of the 
aisle. We have an obligation to assure 
that this power is checked, because 
those police forces are coming to your 
city and your community—to Albu-
querque, to Chicago, and, potentially, 
to Hartford, Stamford, and New Haven, 
CT, without the permission or invita-
tion of our local officials. 
Again, it is a fundamental difference 
between many past uses of political 
power and this one. And it may be 
rationalized or disguised as an effort to 
combat violence in the streets, but we 
know the purpose and intent and effect 
of the use of these policing forces.

So whether they are the Department 
of Justice or Homeland Security or De-
partment of Transportation or the Se-
cret Service, the goal is the same—to 
intimidate and incite, not to restore 
order. 
The shame and disgrace to this Na-
tion is palpable. When our allies, when 
people abroad look to the United 
States, they see us as an exception to 
the rule of force unchecked by the rule 
of law. Too often, force, not law, ap-
plies to subjugate rights. We are an ex-
ceptional nation because we believe in 
the rule of law, but what we are seeing 
right now is a corruption of the rule of 
law, in fact, using the disguise and mis-
using the name of law and order to 
push forward an agenda of hatred and 
bias and subjugation of basic rights. It 
is a shameful and tragic time for Amer-
ica. 
My hope is Americans will rise up, 
that they will object with their voices 
and, ultimately, with their votes. 
I yield the floor back to my colleague 
from Oregon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Connecticut 
for bringing his experience in the legal 
world to bear on this extraordinary de-
velopment of secret police being de-
ployed on the streets of America. 
As we heard from the President, he 
wants to expand this model. It was 
first in DC. Then it was Portland. Now 
he is talking about Philadelphia and 
Baltimore, Chicago and Detroit, Oak-
land. In other words, all across Amer-
ica, as the President says, where there 
happens to be Democratic mayors, he 
wants to go create that same mayhem. 
Thank you for bringing your exper-
tise to bear on this. 
I had just read the story from Krista 
about the moms and the protesters all 
getting, as she put, it ‘‘GASSED BAD.’’ 
She said, ‘‘It was brutal. . . . coughing 
and burning 4 hours later.’’ Then she 
closes with, ‘‘C’mon dads . . . we have 
[to have] meaningful change. Don’t 
give up. . . . ‘’ 
I was thinking about what I am de-
scribing, as I read these stories, or 
what these women are describing is the 
transition from this setting, where 
women are dancing; they are holding 
flowers; they are singing; they are 
chanting; they are eating ribs; and 
what unfolded a few moments later. 
And what unfolded? 
Two of these stories, so far, have de-
scribed the sudden appearance of large 
men in camouflage, armed with side-
arms, who shortly started to shoot 
them, gas them, spray them, throw 
flashbang grenades, tackle them—in 
one case, hogtie a woman who was a 
few feet away. 
And you can see how terrifying— 
these are men dressed for war against 
women dancing and holding flowers. 
This is beyond wrong. This is incon-
ceivable. These unmarked, no agency, 
no unique identifier secret police— 
what my colleague just referred to like 
the little green men in Russia, coming 
to sweep people off the streets and 
throw them into unmarked vans. 
These pictures, I understand, are 
from 2 nights ago, and people were de-
scribing 
to 
me 
how 
batons 
were 
brought down—one on the neck of a 
woman—how they were thrown to the 
ground. This is showing maybe some of 
that right there. I can’t imagine how 
terrified this woman was. 
Think about this: Within this week 
where we are recognizing John Lewis 
passing away—here is John Lewis on 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge being beat-
en by so-called public safety officers; I 
think they were Alabama police, but I 
am not sure who they were; they have 
badges; at least they weren’t secret po-
lice—and this scene from 2 nights ago 
in Portland, these women being as-
saulted by these men ready for war 
with every armament you can think 
about, including impact projectiles; 
that is, rubber bullets and gas and 
flashbang grenades and batons, assault-
ing these women dressed in yellow T- 
shirts. 
I want to stress, as this last letter 
did, that for weeks and weeks and 
weeks before there was a ‘‘wall of 
moms,’’ protesters of every race were 
coming down to say we must reform 
systemic racism in America, and they, 
too, were peacefully protesting, and 
they, too, were standing, often with 
arms linked. 
The outrage over the Federal troops 
being deployed with these secret police 
tactics has swelled the numbers, in-
cluding this most recent protest, but 
let’s not think for a moment there 
haven’t been people of great courage 
week after week, many of them orga-
nized and led by the Black population 
and Black leaders of Portland. 
How is it possible—Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, where a little over a year ago I 
was standing with my daughter and 
John Lewis, remembering what hap-
pened back when, when out-of-control 
leaders sent well-armed men to bru-
tally assault peaceful protesters, and 
now, once again, we have out-of-con-
trol men, the President of the United 
States, sending well-armed men to bru-
tally beat peaceful protesters. How is 
this conceivable? 
Protesters of all kinds have been 
working hard to basically say let’s 
have public safety that works for all. 
But what is the President doing? While 
he is sending these forces to brutally 
beat peaceful protesters, he is running 
campaign ads, and here it is: ‘‘You 
won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America. 
Paid for by Donald J. Trump for Presi-
dent.’’ 
He is deliberately assaulting peaceful 
protesters in order to run campaign 
commercials that say he is a strong 
man who can reduce violence in Amer-
ica. 
Let us all beware how twisted this is, 
how evil this is, how wrong this is, how 
much of an assault on the civil lib-
erties of Americans this is, and how 
much we have a responsibility, having 
taken an oath to the Constitution, to 
put an end to it, which is why I am 
down here for the third day in a row 
saying: Let’s insist that Federal offi-
cers be identified by whom they rep-
resent, the agency. Let’s insist Federal 
officers have a unique identifier. Let’s 
insist that if their mission is to protect 
a Federal building, they are on the pe-
rimeter of the Federal building, not 
sweeping through the streets of Port-
land, throwing people into unmarked 
vans. 
That is my amendment. That is the 
amendment I am asking to be consid-
ered on this floor. Isn’t it our responsi-
bility to debate when egregious things 
happen in America, like a strongman, 
authoritarian President trampling on 
the Constitution by assaulting peaceful 
protestors with Federal forces? Isn’t it 
our responsibility to debate it and vote 
on whether secret police are allowed in 
the United States of America? 
I have been reading these letters 
from the women who were down there. 
I will read one or two more, and then I 
am going to yield to my colleague from 
Oregon. 
As the two Senators from Oregon, we 
have heard from hundreds of people 
who have been protesting peacefully 
over these weeks and how hard local 
leaders have worked to deescalate, and 
how Trump, sending in these Federal 
forces 
to 
beat 
protestors—peaceful 
protestors—has completely escalated 
the situation, rather than deescalating 
it, all so Donald Trump can run a cam-
paign commercial and try to persuade 
you he should be President. 
This story recounting is written by 
Joy, and she was down there with 
Krista, so she starts out: 
I don’t know how my friend, Krista, man-
aged to take a picture during the madness of 
this moment. I could not see anything and 
was struggling to breathe through the mass 
of foamy snot provoked by teargas that filled 
my mask. 
And she had posted a picture that 
Krista had taken of her right after she 
had been gassed. I don’t think I have 
the—do I have the picture? I might 
have. Let me see if we can—no. If I find 
it, I will put it up. 
Getting gassed was painful and scary, yet 
still I felt secure and cared for by the several 
helpers that aided us with water and saline 
eye washes. Several people checked in to see 
if we were ok and help. That is the beautiful 
part of this otherwise unpleasant image. 
This is me on my knees, being helped by 
strangers. The ugly part of this moment is 
what happened before this . . . the moment 
when federal agents blasted us with teargas 
and rubber bullets despite ZERO provocation 
from our line of moms . . . we were simply 
standing side by side with linked arms. 
That’s it. For no apparent reason they shot 
at a bunch of moms without giving a single 
warning. Nope, no warning. No request to 
move. They just blasted away at us like they 
were playing a video game. 
I yield to my colleague from Oregon 
and reserve the balance of my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4439 
July 23, 2020 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague for put-
ting a human face—the face of Orego-
nians—on this Federal invasion of our 
State. 
And I want to talk just for a moment 
and ask my colleague a question be-
cause, yesterday, here in Washington, 
as our constituents were finding this 
horrific invasion of their constitu-
tional rights—the moms and others, 
when they were peacefully protesting— 
what we saw in the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, I say to Senator MERKLEY, 
was an example of just how discon-
nected the Trump administration is 
from reality as they try to find these 
figleafs to cover up for their violation 
of the constitutional rights of our citi-
zens. 
We had a nominee for a top legal po-
sition in the Trump administration—a 
top position, legal position, that is 
greatly going to affect the constitu-
tional rights of the people we are hon-
ored to represent—the rights that are 
now being violated, as we have said re-
peatedly here on the floor. 
The nominee’s name was Patrick 
Hovakimian, and I asked him a couple 
of basic questions, questions that our 
constituents are asking. 
I asked him: Do you believe that Fed-
eral forces can patrol American cities 
over the objections of State and local 
officials and away from Federal build-
ings? 
That is something you and I get 
asked all the time by our constituents. 
Then I also asked him: Do you be-
lieve that unidentified Federal forces 
in unmarked cars can drive around 
seizing and detaining American citi-
zens? 
This is also something we are very 
familiar with. I pointed out American 
troops, our soldiers who so coura-
geously fight the terrorists, wear their 
identification. Again, he just ducked 
and bobbed and weaved. At one point— 
and then he repeated it—he said: Sen-
ator, just give my best wishes to the 
people of Portland. 
I asked again for a responsive an-
swer, and he wished us best wishes 
again for these people who are getting 
gassed, like Sharon Meieran—whom 
the Senator and I talked about, a per-
sonal friend of our family, an emer-
gency room doctor—getting hit with a 
tear gas canister—‘‘sending best wish-
es’’ to the people you and I represent. 
So it seems to me—and I would be in-
terested in the Senator’s thoughts be-
cause he has spent a lot of time think-
ing through where this is headed be-
cause we in Oregon were kind of the 
test tube. We were the people who were 
going to be first. The President has 
said that he is going on to other cities. 
Both of us share a great interest in 
healthcare. I sure as hell wish that he 
would attack the coronavirus with half 
of the intensity with which he has at-
tacked our cities. We are going to talk 
some more about that. 
Let me get the Senator’s reaction to 
what I think is the central question, 
and I really pondered this as we were 
listening to these nonanswers yester-
day by a top Trump official. By the 
way, he is in a top position now in the 
Justice Department responsible for 
knowing about these legal issues that 
reflect the violations of the constitu-
tional rights of our constituents, and 
then he gets a bigger job, a bigger role 
in these issues. I thought to myself, it 
seems to me, without drawing a line in 
the sand, America may be looking 
down the barrel of martial law in the 
middle of a Presidential election. I 
would be interested in the thoughts my 
colleague because I have been amazed 
at the number of Senators who have 
come up and said: You know, RON, that 
really seems to be what it has come 
down to. 
My colleague is a student of history 
and has brought so much specific docu-
mentation, such as the cases he has 
been spelling out. I would be interested 
in my colleague’s assessment of where 
he thinks this is going. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator 
for asking for my thoughts on this. 
Just before he spoke, I had described 
the story of Joy, who talked about the 
hit that her friend Krista had taken 
during this chaos after she had been 
gassed. I did check, and here is the pic-
ture of her. You can see her whole face 
is inflamed. There are so many people 
who can’t see. They are dazed, and 
their lungs are on fire, and Patrick 
Hovakimian is sending best wishes to 
the people of Oregon. 
It reminds me of a cartoon I saw 
when I was young in which Lucy goes 
out after it is observed how cold 
Snoopy is, out shivering on top of his 
doghouse during a snowstorm, and 
Lucy goes out and says ‘‘Hope you stay 
warm,’’ and goes back into her house. 
Yeah—‘‘Best wishes, but I am not doing 
a thing to help you out.’’ 
I would love for Mr. Hovakimian to 
say: I will come and stand there. I will 
see what is really going on, and if 
peaceful protesters are being attacked, 
that is simply unacceptable, and as a 
leader I will take it to President 
Trump and tell President Trump that 
we don’t do secret police in America. 
We don’t sweep people into vans, and if 
you really want me to take this posi-
tion, that is what I am going to change 
the policy to because that is what you 
do in a republic. We are not a dictator-
ship. 
That is what I would like to hear him 
say in response to your question to 
him. 
You asked about martial law. Secret 
police operating as rogue operators 
outside the framework of law, outside 
of the cooperation of the Governor or 
the mayor sound like the equivalent of 
martial law to me. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, how 
much additional time does my col-
league have? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Oregon has 26 min-
utes postcloture. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Oregon for 
his intense representation of these 
legal issues and the role of the Intel-
ligence Committee, noting that this 
has all the trappings of a President 
bent on the equivalent of martial law, 
operating in this rogue fashion, shred-
ding the constitutional rights of peo-
ple, sending Federal officers to attack 
peaceful protesters. 
I was reading the stories of women 
who were down at the protests the 
night before last. The next one is from 
Stephanie. 
She says: 
I went downtown again last night to peace-
fully protest. To use my voice and my 1st 
Amendment rights. To feel safe—repeat: TO 
FEEL SAFE—against these anonymous fed-
eral agents. I wore: 
—A bike helmet 
—Goggles 
—A double mask 
—Ear plugs 
And I was still terrified. The #WallofMoms 
stood locked, arm in arm, right up against 
the fence line at the federal courthouse. We 
stood between these federal agents dressed in 
war gear and unarmed protesters shouting 
behind us. Sweat poured down my back. The 
Moms stood for hours. On my bike ride home 
I texted [an individual] Geoff [not me] each 
time I stopped and called Amy . . . to have 
a ‘‘buddy’’ on the phone with me. Every time 
I heard a car, my heart skipped a beat. Is it 
a crew of federal kidnappers, ready to throw 
me into a van? This administration has been 
chipping away at our rights since day 1, but 
this past week in Portland has been an accel-
eration. Wake up, especially those sup-
porting them. We are in a crisis of great 
magnitude and we are about to lose control. 
Candace Jimenez, member of the 
Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, 
said she came out to protest after the 
deployment of Federal agents, and 
said: 
We have been dealing with that for 500 
years. We understand the trauma, the ter-
rorism, and the harm it causes. 
Bev writes: 
In less than eight hours, a group of moms 
helped me put together this #WallofMoms. 
We tried in earnest to give the kids a break 
by shifting the pervasive narrative that pro-
testers are rioters. 
Case and point, we wore our whitest whites 
to show we weren’t there to make trouble, 
we showed up to prove that the feds are the 
violent ones. . . . And we were right. Kids 
took 
down 
fences 
and 
did 
some 
skateboarding, two or three kids [banged] on 
walls, but the other people were peaceful. 
I want to tell you that I didn’t vomit or 
pee my pants after being gassed, but I did. I 
guess I lost control . . . and soon after I 
couldn’t open my eyes. 
To be clear, we moms weren’t armed, [we 
weren’t] throwing rocks, [we weren’t] throw-
ing water. That didn’t happen. 
We were gassed for chanting ‘‘Leave the 
kids alone.’’ 
I want you to think about what’s hap-
pening in this country and ask yourself how 
you’re going to help change it. 
Heather was down at the protests, 
and I don’t have her picture, her larger 
picture, but I can tell you that she 
posted a picture. She is very pregnant. 
How gutsy I think that is that she was 
there, even as she is about to give 
birth.

She writes: 
I am . . . 9mo pregnant . . . and I stood be-
tween the police and the rest of the pro-
testers last night with about 40 other moms. 
My unborn baby is the topic of many Twitter 
debates right now and symbolizes a thousand 
year old debate among those who want to 
stifle women’s freedom. Right now I have 
even more power than usual and I am here to 
use it. 
I am SAFE. Thanks everybody for your 
concern. But we are NOT OK. 
Until all women can carry a pregnancy to 
term . . . and birth without worrying about 
unnecessary trauma and death we are not 
OK. 
I show up for all of the pregnant women 
who have lost their babies or their lives at 
the hands of racist and sexist systems and 
people. I show up for the women who have 
had a hard time getting pregnant because of 
the everyday stress caused by racism. I 
march for all of the Black mothers who 
rightfully agonize about their children’s 
safety outside of their homes. I march for 
anyone who has been injured physically or 
mentally by police brutality, citizen bru-
tality, systemic inequity, intergenerational 
trauma and poverty. I march for the White 
people finally waking up—see me and get 
[me], get out, pay up, and listen! I march for 
all of us because this is a problem for ALL of 
us. When you say ALL lives matter take into 
account what you are doing in your life to 
improve the world for ALL people. . . . Are 
you worried about my unborn child? (please 
answer these questions in your hearts.) Get 
the hell out there and stand up for a better 
world for my baby and his generation. 
Madam President, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time and yield to my col-
league from Oregon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, 
how much time does my colleague have 
on his hour remaining? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Oregon has 20 min-
utes. 
Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, I will take 
a few, and we are very pleased that our 
colleague from Illinois is here and has 
been a very significant ally in this. 
Senator MERKLEY, one of the reasons 
I so appreciate your taking this time is 
that it reminds me a bit of what Jews 
faced in the 1930s. 
My family fled the Nazis in the 1930s. 
Not all of our family got out. My fa-
ther’s great-uncle Max was one of the 
last gassed in Theresienstadt, and Jew-
ish families saw that a democratically 
elected government can transform into 
a murderous regime before the eyes of 
its citizens very quickly. There isn’t 
any bright line when it happens, no 
cinematic moment where everything 
changes—just a moment, as we talked 
about earlier, in which bureaucrats and 
lawyers and police begin to follow the 
bidding of their leader while perverting 
the rules of their Republic. 
This was not a singular event. From 
Europe to Asia to the Americas, demo-
cratically elected governments were 
undermined and replaced by authori-
tarian regimes—often while retaining 
the trappings of a democracy. Bureau-
crats claimed they were just following 
rules, soldiers and police—just fol-
lowing orders. Then they just wished us 
best wishes. 
Rarely did these leaders start with 
majority support, but terror, combined 
with the abuse of the elections proc-
ess—which we are also very concerned 
about—allows them to claim power 
from the ballot box. 
It seems to me you are laying out 
that it is our sacred duty to learn from 
this history, to bring this history to 
the floor and, as I tried to say with re-
spect to the threat of martial law, to 
draw a bright line when a government, 
instituted to protect liberty, is being 
used to attack liberty. We shouldn’t, 
we cannot, and we can’t wait until we 
have a gun at our back to raise the 
alarm. 
The government isn’t going to defend 
itself. The same Attorney General that 
has taken an oath to defend the Con-
stitution will sit idly by while citizens 
are detained without charge and vio-
lently assaulted by the government. 
The same police officer charged with 
defending our citizens will commit 
those assaults if that is what they are 
directed to do. 
If the Executive and any government 
served by the bureaucracy will take all 
the power they can unless a brave judi-
ciary and a strong legislature step up 
and, as you have outlined here on this 
floor, say: ‘‘No more.’’ 
This Congress has been way too pli-
ant in yielding, and it has emboldened 
the executive branch, led by Donald 
Trump, to ignore the constraints that 
have traditionally protected our lib-
erty. 
So my question is—it seems to me 
you are standing up for these kinds of 
core values of freedoms that are what 
we stand for as Americans and that 
this has been the beacon all around the 
world for over a century. I believe what 
you are saying—and I think it would be 
helpful for you to put it in your own 
words—what you are saying is that we 
have to be out here working on your 
legislation and working on these key 
kinds of measures because without this 
effort, there is a real danger, on our 
watch, that the light of liberty will 
fade away? And it seems to me what 
you are saying is that we are better 
than this. 
I would like your reaction to that be-
cause I think if you look at the march 
of history, which in the Wyden house-
hold is very, very personal—to have 
lost family to Hitler’s murderous re-
gime. I would like to hear your 
thoughts about this kind of challenge 
we face and how important the work in 
front of us is to make sure that light of 
liberty doesn’t fade away. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
my colleague described how his family 
was affected by fascism in Germany 
and how his family members died for 
fascism—attacking them, imprisoning 
them in concentration camps, and put-
ting them to death. Don’t we all be-
lieve that every German citizen should 
have stood up to that fascism and said: 
Not here; not by our government; not 
by our people. 
That is exactly why we are on the 
floor right now to say: Secret police— 
not here, not by our government, and 
not allowed in our Republic. Sweeping 
people off the street into unmarked 
vans—not allowed, not here, not our 
government, and we will put an end to 
it. Gassing, assaulting, and batoning 
peaceful protesters on the streets of 
our city—not here, not allowed, and we 
will put an end to it. 
I yield to my colleague, who I believe 
wishes to speak. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would like to direct a question to the 
junior Senator from Oregon through 
the Chair. 
I thank both my colleagues from Or-
egon. I especially thank my colleague 
Senator MERKLEY, who contacted me 
last weekend when the situation was 
unfolding in Portland and talked to me 
about his reaction to it and what he 
was hearing from the people of the 
State he represents. 
Of course, there was genuine concern 
in the city of Chicago, which I am hon-
ored to represent, because this Presi-
dent in the White House had been tak-
ing swipes at that city for years now, 
and we fully anticipated that the 
atrocity that was occurring in Port-
land could occur in Chicago as well. 
I just want to say to the Senator 
from Oregon: Thank you for your lead-
ership on this. Thank you for bringing 
this issue to the floor and to the floor 
of the Senate. 
This is an issue we should be voting 
on. We should have voted on it this 
week. There was no excuse for it. We 
have risen to the occasion before when 
a historic occurrence brings to our at-
tention that the Senate should speak 
and express itself. We should have done 
it this week on the issue that you 
brought, and I hope we can resort to 
this issue quickly—if not today, as 
quickly as possible afterward. 
I am a cosponsor of the legislation 
the Senator is offering, and it is basic. 
It is fundamental. As I recall, and I 
will ask the Senator from Oregon, what 
you are asking for is, if the Federal 
Government is going to send out the 
so-called law enforcement protective 
forces and such, that they identify 
themselves and that they not come 
into a community anonymously, with-
out any indication of who they are. 
I am reminded of the Russian inva-
sion of Ukraine—eastern portions of 
Ukraine, 
the 
Donetsk 
region—and 
Vladimir Putin was very careful that 
his invaders not wear Russian uni-
forms. They were known as little green 
men. We have a comparable situation 
here where the Federal forces are not 
identifying the agencies they represent 
but coming to the streets of Portland 
in camouflage. 
The Senator from Oregon, I would 
like you to please, if you would, re-
spond. Has this not been the case? Has 
this been documented?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4441 
July 23, 2020 
Mr. MERKLEY. To my colleague 
from Illinois, that is exactly right, as 
seen in this picture and the testimony 
of all those who are present. 
Mark Morgan, the Customs and Bor-
der Protection Commissioner, said that 
is not the case, and he said: ‘‘Our per-
sonnel are clearly marked as federal 
[law 
enforcement 
officers] & have 
unique identifiers.’’ They were not. 
They are operating, as you say, like 
little green men, secret police. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask an-
other question through the Chair to 
the Senator from Oregon. 
Is it not also true that many of these 
Federal agencies have defined respon-
sibilities and defined areas of jurisdic-
tion? For example, in the city of Chi-
cago, as probably is the case in Port-
land, OR, there is a Federal protective 
service that has a specific building and 
facility and personnel in that facility 
that they are responsible for. Is that 
not the case in Oregon? 
Mr. MERKLEY. That is the case. 
Mr. DURBIN. And in this situation, 
have these Federal agents of some dif-
ferent agency or whatever extended 
their reach of jurisdiction beyond that 
Federal protective facility? 
Mr. MERKLEY. They have. 
Mr. DURBIN. How far? 
Mr. MERKLEY. Well, they have been 
present in the streets. I don’t know 
just how many blocks from the Federal 
building but certainly not just in the 
perimeter of the Federal property. 
They have swept through streets. They 
have vans that have gone through the 
streets. They have grabbed protesters 
and thrown them into vans. So they 
have departed significantly from, if 
you will, the mission of defending the 
Federal building. 
Mr. DURBIN. Directing another ques-
tion to the Senator through the Chair. 
What has been the coordination of 
this Federal activity with local and 
State law enforcement in Portland, 
OR? 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
request unanimous consent that our 
dialogue be credited to my colleague’s 
1 hour because I am afraid my minutes 
will run out. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MERKLEY. You asked about co-
ordination. My understanding is that 
there was not an invitation from the 
mayor to come, and there was not a 
conversation with the Governor. There 
certainly was no conversation with 
Senator WYDEN and me and the other 
members of the delegation. The Port-
land police have indicated that they 
have not worked in cooperation with 
these Federal forces. They may have 
been 
engaged 
in 
what 
they 
call 
deconfliction, and I don’t know the full 
extent of that. 
Mr. DURBIN. Well, I don’t know if I 
am on my own time at this moment 
or—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. You are. 
Mr. DURBIN. Fine. So I will still 
continue, without objection, with col-
loquy between myself and the junior 
Senator from Oregon. 
Let me say to the Senator that we 
were concerned at the beginning of this 
week, because of your experience, with 
what might happen in the city of Chi-
cago. Senator DUCKWORTH and I sent a 
letter to the President of the United 
States expressing that concern. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
letter dated July 21, 2020, to President 
Trump, along with the press release 
dated July 22, 2020, describing its con-
tents, be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, July 21, 2020. 
President DONALD J. TRUMP, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP: You have indi-
cated that you may send additional federal 
agents to the City of Chicago to conduct po-
licing activities that traditionally are han-
dled by local law enforcement. We strongly 
urge you to refrain from taking this action, 
which is opposed by Governor Pritzker, 
Mayor Lightfoot and other local leaders. 
This week, we introduced legislation with 
other Senate Democrats to prevent you from 
overriding local authorities in this manner. 
Any involvement by federal law enforce-
ment in community policing activity must 
be conducted in coordination with, and with 
the approval of, local officials. In this time 
of heightened tension, we cannot have fed-
eral law enforcement operating at cross-pur-
poses with local leaders. 
In recent days, your Administration has 
deployed federal law enforcement agents in 
the streets of Portland, Oregon, without any 
visible identifying information. These fed-
eral agents have reportedly used excessive 
force against peaceful protestors and de-
tained residents in unmarked vehicles. Such 
conduct is unacceptable anywhere in the 
United States and must not happen in the 
Chicagoland area. 
On February 10, 2017, we sent you a letter 
suggesting a range of ways in which the fed-
eral government could play a helpful and 
supportive role in reducing violence in Chi-
cago. We noted that ‘‘[p]ublic safety is pri-
marily a local responsibility, but the federal 
government must be an engaged partner in 
public safety efforts alongside local officials, 
law enforcement, and community stake-
holders.’’ We recommended that your Admin-
istration take steps to assist local violence 
prevention efforts, including: 
Enhancing Department of Justice (DOJ) 
programs that improve community policing; 
Directing DOJ to promote mentoring and 
job training programs for youth and for-
merly incarcerated individuals; 
Improving mentoring and violence preven-
tion initiatives and boosting funding for re-
cidivism reduction programs; 
Directing DOJ to abide by its commitment 
to help implement policing reforms rec-
ommended by the Department’s Civil Rights 
Division; 
Closing gaps in the FBI gun background 
check system and in federal firearm laws 
that enable straw purchasers and gun traf-
fickers to flood Chicago’s streets with illicit 
guns; 
Prioritizing career and youth training pro-
grams to address lack of economic oppor-
tunity in neighborhoods hit hard by vio-
lence; and 
Redirecting resources that you are devot-
ing to construction of your border wall and 
committing those resources instead to the 
efforts discussed above. 
It has been more than three years since 
then, and you have not replied to our letter 
nor followed through with our suggestions. 
We reiterate that these steps would be more 
effective in reducing violence in Chicago 
than replicating the destabilizing role that 
you have directed federal law enforcement to 
play in Portland. 
With the right leadership, federal law en-
forcement can serve as valuable partners in 
supporting local efforts and helping reduce 
violence in American communities, rather 
than contravening local efforts and exacer-
bating tensions. It’s not too late for you to 
demonstrate such leadership. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD J. DURBIN, 
U.S. Senator. 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
U.S. Senator. 
[Press Release, July 22, 2020] 
DURBIN, DUCKWORTH STATEMENT
ON EXPAN-
SION OF DOJ OPERATION LEGEND TO CHICAGO 
THE
EXPANSION
OF
OPERATION
LEGEND
WILL 
CONSIST OF AN INCREASED FEDERAL LAW EN-
FORCEMENT PRESENCE FROM FBI, DEA, ATF, 
U.S. MARSHALS, AND HSI, FOCUSED ON PRO-
VIDING SUPPORT TO EXISTING VIOLENT CRIME 
TASK FORCES 
WASHINGTON.—U.S. Senators Dick Durbin 
(D–IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D–IL) today 
released the following statement regarding 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) announcing 
an expansion of Operation Legend to Chi-
cago, Illinois. Operation Legend is DOJ’s vio-
lent crime reduction initiative with the stat-
ed goal to provide support and assistance to 
state and local law enforcement partners as 
they work to combat violent crime, and gun 
violence 
in 
particular. 
Durbin 
and 
Duckworth are set to speak with U.S. Attor-
ney John Lausch about Operation Legend 
today. 
‘‘After needless threats from the President, 
we’re relieved the Trump Administration 
says they plan to work with local officials 
and authorities in Chicago rather than un-
dermine local law enforcement and endanger 
our civil rights, as their agents have done in 
Portland. We will continue closely moni-
toring the Administration’s efforts to ensure 
they follow through with this commitment. 
‘‘More than three years ago, we sent Presi-
dent Trump a letter suggesting a range of 
ways in which the Federal Government could 
work in partnership with local officials to 
provide support and resources to assist in 
public safety, violence prevention, and eco-
nomic development efforts in Chicago. While 
we are hopeful that today’s announcement 
means the Administration has reconsidered 
and will take a more positive approach, 
President Trump still has not replied to our 
letter nor followed through with our sugges-
tions. We reiterate that these steps would be 
more effective in reducing violence in Chi-
cago than any effort the Administration may 
take to replicate the destabilizing role it 
played in Portland.’’ 
In their 2017 letter which they reiterated 
yesterday, 
Durbin 
and 
Duckworth 
rec-
ommended that the Trump Administration 
take steps to assist local violence prevention 
efforts, including: 
Enhancing Department of Justice (DOJ) 
programs that improve community policing; 
Directing DOJ to promote mentoring and 
job training programs for youth and for-
merly incarcerated individuals; 
Improving mentoring and violence preven-
tion initiatives and boosting funding for re-
cidivism reduction programs; 
Directing DOJ to abide by its commitment 
to help implement policing reforms rec-
ommended by the Department’s Civil Rights 
Division;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

July 23, 2020 
Closing gaps in the FBI gun background 
check system and in federal firearm laws 
that enable straw purchasers and gun traf-
fickers to flood Chicago’s streets with illicit 
guns; 
Prioritizing career and youth training pro-
grams to address lack of economic oppor-
tunity in neighborhoods hit hard by vio-
lence; and 
Redirecting resources that are being de-
voted to construction of border wall and 
committing those resources instead to the 
efforts discussed above. 
The expansion of Operation Legend will 
consist of an increased federal law enforce-
ment presence in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
and in Chicago, Illinois. This federal law en-
forcement presence will consist of experi-
enced investigative agents from FBI, DEA, 
ATF, U.S. Marshals, and HSI, focused on pro-
viding support to existing violent crime task 
forces. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would say to the Senator from Oregon 
that the Department of Justice made 
an announcement yesterday that they 
were, in fact, sending, I assume, a num-
ber of Federal agents—150—into Chi-
cago in pursuit of an operation known 
as Operation Legend. This is an oper-
ation which began July 8, 2020, by the 
Federal Government starting in Kansas 
City because of the death of a 4-year- 
old young man, Legend Taliferro, shot 
and killed in the early morning hours 
in Kansas City on June 29. 
I received a phone call this morning 
from John Lausch, the U.S. attorney 
for the Northern District of Illinois, a 
man whom I was instrumental in se-
lecting and supporting and still do sup-
port to this day—his professional ac-
tivities—who gave me his personal as-
surance that what happened in Oregon 
was not going to happen in Chicago; 
that this Operation Legend, as he de-
scribed it to me, was in coordination 
with State and local law enforcement 
in the city of Chicago, the State of Illi-
nois, to make certain that their activi-
ties were coordinated and known in ad-
vance and that they were focusing on 
gun violence and drug trafficking in 
the city of Chicago. 
I have also been alerted by Mayor 
Lori Lightfoot that she has received 
the same assurances and briefing, as 
well as Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illi-
nois. 
So our circumstances are different 
from the ones that Portland faced. I 
will tell you that we are going to hold 
Mr. Lausch and the Department of Jus-
tice and all others to their word that 
we will not see in Chicago anything 
like we witnessed in the streets of 
Portland, OR. 
I just want to say in closing to the 
Senator from Oregon: Thank you for 
bringing this to our attention because 
when we were alerted—the Governor, 
the 
mayor 
of 
Chicago—Senator 
DUCKWORTH and I both jumped on this 
immediately and contacted the Trump 
administration for clarity about what 
was going to happen in Chicago. We 
have been given these assurances. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
lengthy press release, which describes 
the activities that are going to take 
place, again, with the knowledge and 
coordination of local law enforcement, 
be printed in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD as follows: 
[Press Release, July 21, 2020] 
DURBIN, DUCKWORTH
CALL
OUT
PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ON REPORTS OF PLAN TO SEND SE-
CRET POLICE TO CHICAGO 
SENATORS
INTRODUCE
LEGISLATION
TO
BLOCK 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM DEPLOY-
ING FEDERAL FORCES AS A SHADOWY PARA-
MILITARY AGAINST AMERICANS 
WASHINGTON.—Following 
reports 
that 
President Donald Trump wants to send fed-
eral agents into cities, including Chicago, to 
conduct policing activities that are tradi-
tionally handled by local law enforcement, 
U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D–IL) and 
Tammy Duckworth (D–IL) today sent a let-
ter to President Trump calling on him to re-
frain from taking this action, which is op-
posed by Governor Pritzker, Mayor Light-
foot, and other local leaders. 
‘‘With the right leadership, federal law en-
forcement can serve as valuable partners in 
supporting local efforts and helping reduce 
violence in American communities, rather 
than contravening local efforts and exacer-
bating tensions. It’s not too late for you to 
demonstrate such leadership,’’ Durbin and 
Duckworth wrote. 
Yesterday, Durbin and Duckworth joined 
Senators Jeff Merkley (D–OR), Ron Wyden 
(D–OR), and 17 of their Senate colleagues to 
introduce the Preventing Authoritarian Po-
licing Tactics on America’s Streets Act, 
which was also introduced as an amendment 
to the National Defense Authorization Act. 
The bill would block the Trump Administra-
tion from deploying federal forces as a shad-
owy paramilitary against Americans. The 
legislation comes after a week in which 
heavily armed, unmarked federal forces in 
unmarked vehicles were filmed grabbing pro-
testers off the street in Portland, Oregon. 
In February 2017, Durbin and Duckworth 
sent a letter to President Trump suggesting 
a range of ways in which the federal govern-
ment could work in partnership with local 
officials to provide support and resources to 
assist in public safety, violence prevention, 
and economic development efforts in Chi-
cago. 
Full text of today’s letter is available here 
and below: 
JULY 21, 2020. 
DEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP: You have indi-
cated that you may send additional federal 
agents to the City of Chicago to conduct po-
licing activities that traditionally are han-
dled by local law enforcement We strongly 
urge you to refrain from taking this action, 
which is opposed by Governor Pritzker, 
Mayor Lightfoot and other local leaders. 
This week, we will introduce legislation with 
other Senate Democrats to prevent you from 
overriding local authorities in this manner. 
Any involvement by federal law enforce-
ment in community policing activity must 
be conducted in coordination with, and with 
the approval of, local officials. In this time 
of heightened tension, we cannot have fed-
eral law enforcement operating at cross-pur-
poses with local leaders. 
In recent days, your Administration has 
deployed federal law enforcement agents in 
the streets of Portland, Oregon, without any 
visible identifying information. These fed-
eral agents have reportedly used excessive 
force against peaceful protestors and de-
tained residents in unmarked vehicles. Such 
conduct is unacceptable anywhere in the 
United States and must not happen in the 
Chicagoland area. 
On February 10, 2017, we sent you a letter 
suggesting a range of ways in which the fed-
eral government could play a helpful and 
supportive role in reducing violence in Chi-
cago. We noted that ‘‘[p]ublic safety is pri-
marily a local responsibility, but the federal 
government must be an engaged partner in 
public safety efforts alongside local officials, 
law enforcement, and community stake-
holders.’’ We recommended that your Admin-
istration take steps to assist local violence 
prevention efforts, including: 
Enhancing Department of Justice (DOJ) 
programs that improve community policing; 
Directing DOJ to promote mentoring and 
job training programs for youth and for-
merly incarcerated individuals; 
Improving mentoring and violence preven-
tion initiatives and boosting funding for re-
cidivism reduction programs; 
Directing DOJ to abide by its commitment 
to help implement policing reforms rec-
ommended by the Department’s Civil Rights 
Division; 
Closing gaps in the FBI gun background 
check system and in federal firearm laws 
that enable straw purchasers and gun traf-
fickers to flood Chicago’s streets with illicit 
guns; 
Prioritizing career and youth training pro-
grams to address lack of economic oppor-
tunity in neighborhoods hit hard by vio-
lence; and 
Redirecting resources that you are devot-
ing to construction of your border wall and 
committing those resources instead to the 
efforts discussed above. 
It has been more than three years since 
then, and you have not replied to our letter 
nor followed through with our suggestions. 
We reiterate that these steps would be more 
effective in reducing violence in Chicago 
than replicating the destabilizing role that 
you have directed federal law enforcement to 
play in Portland. 
With the right leadership, federal law en-
forcement can serve as valuable partners in 
supporting local efforts and helping reduce 
violence in American communities, rather 
than contravening local efforts and exacer-
bating tensions. It’s not too late for you to 
demonstrate such leadership. 
Sincerely, * * * 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what 
happened in Portland, OR, is unaccept-
able in the United States of America. 
We have heard the historical analogies 
from the senior Senator from Oregon 
where authoritarian central govern-
ments moved into an area and took 
control. We have seen the historic par-
allel in the eastern reaches of Ukraine, 
in Crimea. We know what it looks like 
because history has shown us. We don’t 
want this occurring in the United 
States of America. 
I am sorry for those who were injured 
and bear the scars of this Federal in-
cursion in the city of Portland, OR. I 
stand with the junior Senator from Or-
egon. We will call and we will pass, I 
hope, on a bipartisan basis the reasser-
tion of the basic principles of this 
country when it comes to the separa-
tion of powers and when it comes to 
the dignity which we ask in the streets 
of America under our Constitution. 
I thank the junior Senator from Or-
egon. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague so much for com-
ing down to stand up for the people of

his home State and say that ‘‘secret 
police don’t belong in my State, in my 
city of Chicago, or anywhere in the 
United States’’ and that we should act 
on this floor to make sure that is not 
the case. 
We must work and fight for the citi-
zens all across this country. It would 
be the right thing for us to debate my 
simple amendment that says: ID, and 
you stay in the near vicinity of a Fed-
eral property, and you don’t engage in 
these attacks on peaceful protesters. 
We should debate it. If people dis-
agree with it, they should stand up and 
explain why. Maybe we can come to a 
common understanding. Do you know 
how rare it is for Senators to come 
down and actually have dialogue and 
debate? It just doesn’t happen. On 
something 
as 
important 
as 
this, 
shouldn’t every Member be here weigh-
ing in and considering it? 
How much time do I have left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Oregon has 18 min-
utes. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I am going to read 
another story from a woman who was 
at the protest 2 nights ago. Her name is 
Tiffany. She says: 
I was there. Let it be known that police 
fired on peaceful protesters. The Feds are 
here. This is really happening in #portland. 
. . . knowing the risks, in the middle of a 
pandemic, mothers of our city formed a 
chain to protect the peaceful protesters. We 
stood united with flowers, yellow shirts . . . 
and peace signs. 
I thought I would put up again the 
picture of this protester with her flow-
ers. 
She continues: 
Behind the safety of their fence, the police 
fired upon a small number of us with their 
‘‘non-lethal’’ bullets. As a symbol, I used my 
baby’s blanket to attempt to shield myself. 
They therefore knew exactly what they were 
doing. They heard our peaceful calls and 
fired anyway. 
When the fence fell, and the mothers con-
tinued to protest peacefully from the side, 
the police threw tear gas at us. We had to 
[scatter] into the streets, stumbling, trying 
to keep our masks on, trying to avoid more 
gas and cars. 
When we attempted to regroup, the Feds 
had arrived. Some of us just trying to make 
our way to our cars, found our way blocked 
by federal agents in full combat gear. 
Full combat gear. 
They too fired gas at unarmed protesters, 
including myself. I yelled ‘‘You are in viola-
tion of the US Constitution. You are in vio-
lation of the Bill of Rights. I own my home 
in Portland, Oregon. I pay my taxes in Port-
land, Oregon. I have a right to walk on my 
own street without being assaulted by my 
government. I have a right to be here’’. . . . 
They silenced us with more gas. 
See the images for yourself. 
When the government attempts to take 
your liberty, that is when it is appropriate to 
risk your life. Nonetheless, you will notice 
we took every precaution to stop the spread. 
Every single one of us wore a mask. We had 
people spraying hand sanitizer from spray 
bottles. But you know, once you got gassed, 
it is very hard not to spread water droplets. 
Gas makes your nose and eyes pour water 
like a faucet! Not necessarily nonlethal force 
when we are in the middle of a Pandemic. 
I reserve the balance of my time, and 
yield to my colleague from Con-
necticut. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
appreciate the Senator breaking for a 
moment to allow me to just a say few 
words. I might pose a question to him, 
if he chooses to answer with the re-
maining part of his time. 
I want to make sure that my re-
marks are counted toward my time, 
not Senator MERKLEY’s time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct. 
Mr. MURPHY. Senator MERKLEY and 
I serve on the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee together, and what we have 
watched together, over the course of 
our time on that committee, is a rever-
sal of what was called by some scholars 
‘‘the end of history.’’ There was this 
idea that democracy was going to be 
triumphant in the world; that in the 
wake of the fall of the Soviet Union 
and 
the 
Berlin 
Wall, 
democracy— 
participatory, open democracies—and 
capitalist economies had, effectively, 
won the fight and that it was just a 
matter of time before the rest the 
world was living in a system like ours 
that respects the rule of law and allows 
for those who want to protest their 
government to do so under the protec-
tion of law. And much of our outreach 
to the Communist Party in China dur-
ing the 1980s and 1990s came under the 
presumption that even China would 
eventually fall under the crushing 
weight of an advancing democracy. 
We now know that to not be true be-
cause we are at a moment in time in 
which we hear on the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee uninterrupted testi-
mony of countries that we would have, 
even just a decade ago, accepted and 
named as a democracy, starting to 
slide away from the rule of law, away 
from the protection of speech into 
something else. 
Now, you don’t go from a democracy 
into an autocracy overnight. So many 
of the countries we are concerned 
about are in that transition. We hope 
that an active United States, playing a 
role for democracy promotion in the 
world, can help pull them back. But it 
is a reminder—it is a reminder—that 
democracy in many ways is a very un-
natural mechanism to control or run 
your life or society. 
I always remind my constituents 
back home that there aren’t many 
other things in life that are really im-
portant that you run by democratic 
vote. You don’t run your business by 
democratic vote. Your kid’s sports 
team doesn’t run by democratic vote. I 
love my 8-year-old and 11-year-old, but 
they don’t get an equal vote in the de-
cisions in my household. 
Democracy is fairly unnatural. We 
don’t really choose it as a mechanism 
to run other institutions in this coun-
try, but we reserve it for government. 
We reserve it for government, but it 
only remains, it only survives, it only 
perseveres if we tend to it, and we have 
not been tending to it over the last 3 
years. 
I rise to support Senator MERKLEY 
and his effort because I have watched 
what these other governments do at 
the outset—these would be autocrats— 
what they do to try to gently begin to 
quell people’s interest in free speech. 
The tactics that are being used in Port-
land, the tactics that were used just 
down the street, in the Nation’s Cap-
ital, the tactics that are being con-
templated for other cities throughout 
this country are reminiscent of tactics 
that have been proven successful in 
other countries to try to push people 
back inside their homes and to try to 
disincentivize their interests in speak-
ing up against power, because, I am 
going to tell you, as word spreads that 
if you run out to the streets to protest 
your government, you may be requi-
sitioned and shoved into an unmarked 
vehicle, if you are a single mom, who 
can’t disappear for an hour, never mind 
a day, you aren’t going to be that in-
terested in going out and speaking 
freely. All of a sudden, if the govern-
ment is starting to come down like a 
ton of bricks with Federal troops, with 
sweeps of peaceful protesters off the 
streets and into confinement, it does 
start to chill people’s interest in stand-
ing up. And that is why governments 
across the world have tried to pioneer 
these practices. 
They say they are still democracies. 
They say they still observe the rule of 
law, but, then, when people try to go 
out and protest, they throw the mili-
tary at them. They start to snatch peo-
ple off the streets, and, all of a sudden, 
people start to think to themselves 
that they are better off just staying in 
their homes. They are better off not 
protesting their government because 
the consequences now feel too signifi-
cant. 
I know, Senator MERKLEY, that a lot 
of folks claim that we are engaged in a 
hyperbole when we talk about the risks 
to democracy presented by this admin-
istration, but through our collective 
seats on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, we see what is happening 
around the world. We see the ways in 
which, 
drip 
by 
drip, 
an 
open 
participatory democracy can all of a 
sudden start to foreclose the rights of 
people to be able to petition their gov-
ernment. 
We should just remember that over 
the course of history, it is .001 percent 
of citizens who have lived in a democ-
racy. This is not actually how the 
world has chosen to organize itself. We 
now have these templates. We now 
have these models provided to us by 
people like the leader in Turkey or the 
new President in the Philippines by 
which we should be cautioned in the 
ways in which we start to constrain 
speech, the ways in which we start to 
punish speech, the ways in which we 
start to make people believe that there 
is so much risk in speaking out against 
their government that they are better 
off just accepting whatever comes their 
way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4444 
July 23, 2020 
So I come to the floor today as some-
one who introduced legislation requir-
ing the identification of military forces 
when they are doing crowd control. 
The minute that I saw those unmarked 
officers on the streets of the Nation’s 
Capital, I knew how dangerous it was. 
I know enough about the history of our 
own country to know that vigilante 
justice, masked from identification, is 
reminiscent of some of the worst mo-
ments in American history. I know 
that we should be students of our own 
history to understand the danger to de-
mocracy presented by unidentified, un-
accountable agents of justice, but I 
also know, as a student of the world 
today, that there are plenty of exam-
ples overseas that should caution us as 
well. 
Maybe there isn’t a question in there, 
Senator MERKLEY, but I am just so ap-
preciative of your efforts, so appre-
ciative that you have allowed me and 
the legislation that I have offered with 
Senator SCHUMER to require identifica-
tion of Federal security forces to be 
added to the bill that you are offering. 
I will be with you every step of the 
way, if we are not successful in getting 
it included in the legislation pending 
today, to make sure it finds a way into 
law. I think your legislation is a cor-
nerstone of our strategy to protect de-
mocracy for the next 240 years. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Would my colleague 
from Connecticut yield for a question? 
Mr. MURPHY. I would. 
Mr. MERKLEY. For clarification, 
will my question be credited to my col-
league’s time, and can I ask unanimous 
consent that that it be credited to his 
time? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). If the Senator for Connecticut 
yields for a question, it comes off his 
time. 
Mr. MURPHY. I would yield for a 
question, then. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. 
You made the point about lack of 
identification. I have here the picture 
of how these have been deployed. I will 
make sure you can see it as well. 
Many are in camouflage—the generic 
police, with no sense of what agency 
they are part of, no unique identifier, 
even as the head of their organiza-
tion—it was later clarified, and we 
found out, that they were CBP, Cus-
toms and Border Protection. 
He said: Of course, they have unique 
identifiers and, of course, they are 
marked as Federal law enforcement— 
which they are not. But if one of these 
individuals, in the course of attacking 
protesters, shoots them with a rubber 
bullet that fractures their forehead and 
puts them in critical condition in the 
hospital, would we have any idea how 
to hold that officer accountable if they 
have no ID? 
Mr. MURPHY. Thank you for the 
question. 
This is what led me to join with 
many of my other colleagues, as I men-
tioned, including Senator SCHUMER, to 
introduce the legislation in the wake of 
the protests in our Nation’s Capital. 
Accountability is also a cornerstone 
of the rule of law. The only way that 
we can aggrieve abuses of power is to 
know who committed those abuses of 
power. 
Listen, these troops or these riot offi-
cers were ordered to be in that space. 
Let’s be honest that the vast majority 
of these patriotic law enforcement offi-
cers are trying to do the right thing. 
But we know, because we have seen the 
video, that there have been repeated— 
repeated—abuses on the streets of 
Portland, on the streets of New York 
City, and on the streets of the Nation’s 
Capital. When those occur, frankly, it 
should be in the interest of law en-
forcement leadership themselves to be 
able to hold those individuals account-
able so that we can make sure that the 
blame is not ascribed to every single 
individual who is uniformed and on 
these streets, but that we hold the spe-
cific individuals, or the individuals 
who ordered them to take those ac-
tions, accountable. 
So as a broad question, Americans 
should want to know what agency 
these individuals are representing, and 
they should at least have a badge num-
ber attached to them so that we can 
make sure that individual actions have 
a line of accountability. But I would 
argue that the agency themselves 
should want that if they are really in 
the business of making sure that any 
abuses of power by their officers or by 
their soldiers or by their police are 
held to account as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Connecticut 
for his intense effort to defend the civil 
rights of citizens—not only of his State 
but all Americans—and for the truth 
he speaks that, when you have anony-
mous officers in war gear attacking 
peaceful crowds and committing, real-
ly, disturbing acts of violence against 
them, it is an unacceptable thing in 
our democracy. 
He has noted that there was this con-
versation about the triumph of democ-
racy as a strategy and it was going to 
spread and where we were going to find 
ourselves by this time was a world 
ruled by ‘‘we the people’’ governments 
across the land and how that is not the 
case. 
He mentioned several countries that 
have been backsliding, and I think we 
could add to that those places like Po-
land and Hungary. I believe he men-
tioned Turkey. 
It is tempting to be a strongman, and 
we have heard the President of the 
United States convey his admiration 
for these strongmen across the planet. 
But then he starts to bring their secret 
police, fascist tactics to the streets of 
America, and we have an obligation— 
under our oaths of office and simply as 
citizens of this Nation—to stand up and 
say no. 
I have been reading letters from 
women who were on the frontline down 
in the peaceful protests, clarifying that 
there was no violence except the vio-
lence of the Federal agents against 
them. 
Here is another such letter: 
I am a mom. I am a nurse. I live in Port-
land. I was peacefully protesting police bru-
tality and racism tonight alongside other 
moms as part of the protests in downtown 
Portland. I had my arms linked with my own 
mom and my close friend when Federal 
agents in camo rushed us with guns pointed. 
They paused for a split second (as if to con-
sider if they were really going to enact vio-
lence on a group of unarmed moms) then 
they pushed people down to my left. We were 
[chanting] ‘‘don’t hurt our kids.’’ They threw 
flash-bangs at our feet. They tear gassed the 
crowd. 
I will not be silent. This is not ok. Don’t 
just consume the line that it is a bunch of 
anarchists the police and feds are attacking. 
That is not ok. Black lives matter. 
I have many more letters of people 
explaining what happened. They all are 
basically the same: There were some 
kids doing some graffiti; there was 
some pounding on the door of the Fed-
eral courthouse, but there was no vio-
lence. The only violence came from the 
Feds attacking the peaceful protesters. 
I am going to reserve the balance of 
my time. I see my colleague is here 
from the State of Utah. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
would inquire how much time I have 
remaining, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has 12 minutes postcloture time 
remaining. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have 
been using this time to share stories 
from women who have been down at 
the peaceful protests in Portland and 
then as they relay that they are at-
tacked even though there is no vio-
lence in the protest. And they are at-
tacked in an incredibly violent way. 
This is not, of course, the story the 
administration is telling the world, the 
President is telling the world. He says: 
There is violence, and we stopped it. 
The truth is, it was a peaceful pro-
test, and Trump’s Federal agents, 
dressed in war outfits, assaulted those 
protesters, as you heard in letter after 
letter after letter. 
It is almost like acts in a play. You 
have women holding flowers, like this 
sunflower, and some had mums. They 
are dancing. They are singing. 
Act 2, the camouflaged secret police, 
Trump’s secret police, come onto the 
street—no agency identifier, no unique 
identifier—and then they start assault-
ing the women. That is act 3, the as-
sault. 
These women are describing that as-
sault in graphic terms. It is tear gas. It 
is flashbang grenades. It is pepper 
spray. It is batons. It is a woman a few 
feet away being hogtied. It is a woman 
a few feet away being knocked to the 
ground. That is act 3. 
And why is this happening? Because 
the President likes the authoritarian, 
secret-police 
tactics 
of 
dictators 
around the world and wants them to

bring them to the United States of 
America and is bringing them to the 
United States of America. 
Maybe the moment he is doing it— 
right now—is because he is running 
campaign ads about what a good person 
he is to stop violence in America. 
Let’s understand that the President 
of the United States is creating vio-
lence in the streets so he can run cam-
paign ads to say that he will stop the 
violence. That is this play. 
It feels like a Greek tragedy. It feels 
like something that would never hap-
pen in America—but it is. 
I have been relaying these letters 
that describe it in so much better 
terms than anyone can. This letter is 
from Karen—or this Facebook post is 
from Karen. 
She says: 
Mixed feelings this morning, waking up 
eyes still stinging and a metallic taste in my 
mouth after ending the night of nonviolent 
protest with the #WallofMoms being gassed, 
shot at, and manhandled to the ground with-
out provocation. Here’s what happened. 
The majority of the night was a calm gath-
ering spent listening to speakers, chanting, 
singing, and marching. Toward 11:30ish, folks 
gathered on the steps of the Justice Center. 
I intentionally positioned at the front line 
with the Moms to see for myself the truth. 
There were definitely some idiot kids 
yelling stupid and unproductive things, but 
mainly we gathered calmly, sweating in the 
heat, holding signs and chanting in soli-
darity with BlackLivesMatter. More experi-
enced protesters told the Moms without gas 
masks to get a few layers of people back 
since they knew to expect CS gas again to-
night. The only physical actions taken be-
fore all hell broke loose is that some of the 
protesters were banging and kicking loudly 
on the thick plywood wall that had been con-
structed to block the entrance to the Justice 
Center. 
We waited and then suddenly some kind of 
bullets . . . started shooting out of a small 
hole cut in the plywood, I felt a few stings 
like small pebbles or sand, it didn’t really 
hurt but it scared me. Then some kind of 
smoky stuff (tear gas in hindsight) was in 
the air. I already couldn’t see very well since 
my swim goggles had fogged up, but I didn’t 
feel any burning etc. Those without res-
pirators started leaving when they couldn’t 
see or breathe. Huge loud noises and explo-
sions (?’’flashbangs’’) were going off in front 
and behind us. Some of us linked arms and 
stood together as there were (?where they 
came from) all these big officers in black 
riot gear with batons starting to push us off 
the steps of the Justice Center. We tried to 
hold our ground but then one Mom a few 
down the row from me was grabbed pulled 
back toward the group of officers and they 
started to drag her away. She must have said 
something inflammatory, but she was linked 
arms and could not have hit them, thrown 
objects, or resisted anything. We tried to 
pull her back to us for her safety and then 
suddenly I was grabbed by 3–4 officers who 
were shouting to each other to ‘‘pull her 
down, get her on the ground’’ etc. (indeed 
they shoved and pulled me to the ground, 
grabbing both arms and my backpack to do 
so). Someone from the Moms said, ‘‘let’s go, 
they are surrounding us, we can’t do any-
thing now.’’ By then the swim goggles had 
leaked and my eyes were burning and tearing 
and I . . . couldn’t see, and I just crouched 
on the ground in a ball and put both hands 
up. Then—I heard the officers asking if I was 
ok. Asking if I could stand (I couldn’t since 
I couldn’t see). At least one of them said 
‘‘I’m trying to help you.’’ The crowd was 
yelling ‘‘leave her alone’’ and came from be-
hind me and were coaching me to keep my 
hands up and stay still. Sat there awhile 
shaking, getting my bearings, and finally I 
asked if I was being detained or if I could 
leave. Heard several back and forth con-
versations between the officers about ‘‘she 
resisted us’’ and ‘‘she tried to help her friend 
get away.’’ [And then someone else said] ‘‘if 
she’s willing to leave, just let her go.’’ I kind 
of scootched back on my butt into the crowd 
and then some kind soul asked if he could 
help me up and get away from the gas, took 
my arm and we walked up the block back 
into the park. Some other kind soul asked if 
we needed Maalox for our eyes (that helped a 
little) and then we were out of the bitter 
cloud. 
I felt sorry for the officers actually, who 
were only doing what they were told by some 
pretty evil higher-ups (to disperse nonviolent 
crowds by force), and as far as my experience 
last night, actually seemed to try to do their 
best not to truly hurt me (possibly because I 
am white, female, and was wearing yellow to 
identify as a Mom). 
I got away with some scraped knees and a 
sore hip, plus the stinging eyes and metallic 
taste which will soon pass. But also—worst— 
a heavy heart. It really is senseless out 
there. I don’t have answers and am no longer 
convinced that showing up is helping any-
thing. However, I am pretty sure if the Feds 
hadn’t been called in this would have contin-
ued to fade as hopefully productive real 
change and progress were made involving the 
city government and PD about the actual 
issues—concern about police brutality and 
social inequities for POC [people of color]— 
but now look at us. 
We should look at these protesters 
who are calling for justice, for policing 
that treats everyone equally, and it 
doesn’t profile, doesn’t provide public 
safety protection to some and ignore 
others. It doesn’t view some citizens as 
the clients and other citizens as the 
threat. It doesn’t change their actions 
when they see a group with white skin 
versus black skin or dark skin. 
That conversation is being destroyed 
by the President of America. He is try-
ing to replace that argument for a bet-
ter America that treats people with re-
spect and honors the civil rights of all 
with a different America where secret 
police are deployed to beat the hell out 
of peaceful protesters and then put up 
campaign ads to say that he will fix it. 
We cannot let this story go unan-
swered. At a minimum, collectively, all 
100 of us should say: No secret police— 
they wear identifiers for agencies. 
They wear unique identifiers, and they 
don’t go marching through the streets 
of our city. They stay to protect the 
Federal property they are charged to 
protect. They don’t attack peaceful 
protesters with flashbangs and tear gas 
and pepper spray and rubber bullets 
and batons. We don’t do that here in 
America. 
I hope all 100 Senators will stand up 
and say: Yes, let’s have a debate on a 
very simple amendment that says yes 
to ID on uniforms—there are no secret 
police—and yes to staying on your Fed-
eral property or the near vicinity if 
that is your mission, so we don’t have 
folks on an unrestricted mission of 
sweeping through our streets, grabbing 
people, and throwing them into vans as 
we have seen on the streets of Port-
land. 
I am asking that this Senate do its 
job to address this issue, to hold a de-
bate—long or short, as my colleagues 
would prefer—and vote. It is important 
we raise our voice. It is important we 
vote. It is important we have account-
ability. It is important that we defend 
the Constitution of the United States 
and the citizens of the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4446 
July 23, 2020 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, this is an issue 
that we have talked about for some 
time, and we have spent a whole year 
on this bill. We have covered these 
issues before. I do object to that modi-
fication. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
The Senator from Montana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 2481 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I am here to 
speak about a very important issue fac-
ing our veterans in Montana. In Mon-
tana, we are home to one of the largest 
veteran per capita population in the 
Nation. It is an extraordinary privilege 
for me to represent our veterans. 
I am the son of a veteran, a marine. 
In the U.S. Senate, I represent Mon-
tana’s brave men and women who serve 
our country in uniform, and I have had 
the opportunity to hear concerns from 
our veterans in all corners of our 
State. That is why I am here today. 
Last spring, the widow of a Montana 
veteran, Patricia Pardue, who lives in 
Northwest Montana, approached me 
with a heartbreaking story. Patricia 
saw nearly all of her pension benefits 
that her husband had earned in service 
to our country stripped away by a scam 
artist. 
This scam artist is also referred to as 
a pension poacher. This scam artist 
was receiving Patricia’s full VA pen-
sion, charging her for services that 
would have been free at the VA. 
Sadly, Patricia’s story is not a rare 
occurrence. There are bad actors across 
the country taking advantage of inno-
cent Montanans like Patricia, and they 
need to be stopped. After hearing her 
story, I introduced a bipartisan bill to 
protect our veterans and their families 
from these pension poachers. 
My bill has the support of Senators 
across both sides of the aisle, as well as 
the support of the Military Order of the 
Purple Heart of the USA, the National 
Association of County Veterans Serv-
ice Officers, the Iraq and Afghanistan 
Veterans Association, and other mili-
tary and veterans associations. 
This is a bipartisan bill. It punishes 
those who act illegally by providing ad-
vice or representation to veterans 
without proper accreditation from the 
VA. It is a shame we are even in this 
position today, that there are people 
out there looking to take advantage of 
our Nation’s heroes. 
Today, 
there 
are 
no 
legal 
con-
sequences 
for 
these 
people—these 
shameful and unpatriotic individuals 
who steal money from our Nation’s 
veterans. It is shameful. That is why I 
am fighting to include this bipartisan 
bill as an amendment to the defense 
legislation, 
the 
NDAA, 
before 
us 
today—to protect our servicemembers 
throughout their lives, not just while 
in uniform but always. 
Right now, we can take an important 
step to do everything in our power to 
ensure veterans and their families keep 
their 
benefits, 
not 
lose 
them 
to 
scammers. The longer we wait to fix 
this issue, the longer we are failing our 
veterans and their financial well-being. 
We can fix that right here, right now. 
That is why I am calling on my col-
leagues today to adopt my amendment 
to the NDAA—to protect our veterans, 
to protect the great men and women 
who have served in the defense of our 
country. 
I will stand by the Montana veterans, 
and I will continue fighting this fight 
until we get this done. Therefore, I ask 
the Senator to modify his request to 
include the Daines amendment, No. 
2481. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Oklahoma so modify his 
request? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is a 
meritorious issue, obviously, involving 
veterans. But at this late juncture, 
after the weeks we have spent in delib-
eration both in the committee and 
then on the floor, it is not yet—this 
particular amendment—ready so that 
there is no opposition on my side. 
Since there is opposition, I would like 
to inform the Senate and the chairman 
of that situation. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chairman, I would 
agree it is hard to find anything with 
more merit than this. It is something I 
want to work very hard to accomplish. 
However, we do have an agreement 
that this would violate. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
Mr. Chairman, I came to the floor 
earlier this week to implore my col-
leagues to debate the administration’s 
proposal to withdraw troops from Ger-
many and to vote on my amendment 
aimed at evaluating such a move. 
As I committed in my remarks at 
that time, I am objecting to the man-
agers’ package on the basis that the 
Senate has not been afforded the oppor-
tunity to have that debate. 
The proposed removal of our troops 
from Germany is a matter of extreme 
significance for our national security 
and our military readiness. A decision 
of this magnitude should not occur 
without the input of the U.S. Senate. 
The failure to debate such a consequen-
tial matter is a disservice to this 
Chamber, to our Nation, and to our al-
lies. 
My amendment seeks to evaluate 
such a withdrawal and affirm our sup-
port for Germany, our support for our 
NATO allies, and our national security 
interests, and it sends a strong mes-
sage to our adversaries like Russia. 
Therefore, I ask the Senator to modify 
his request to include the Romney 
amendment No. 1885. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his amendment? 
Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to 
object. 
We have a President who has put this 
plan together. We spent a lot of time 
on this. The Senate has been heard. We 
actually discussed this as we put to-
gether our bill. 
For that reason, I do object to the 
modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every 
year, the Senate considers sweeping 
legislation to authorize operations of 
the Department of Defense and certain 
functions of the Department of Energy. 
The fiscal year 2021 National Defense 
Authorization Act provides a roadmap 
for 
spending 
for 
national 
defense, 
spending which reflects over half of the 
annual Federal budget. Its importance 
is enormous, and its consideration im-
portant. Regrettably, the Senate in re-
cent years has reduced consideration of 
the NDAA to a perfunctory exercise oc-
cupying a couple of weeks of debate, 
and little consideration of amend-
ments. While I support much of what is 
included in this authorizing package, I 
cannot support its passage. 
I am most concerned that the FY21 
NDAA includes authorization for test-
ing of nuclear devices. Where our 
President fails to lead in global diplo-
macy and common decency, he seems 
enthralled with an approach favored by 
autocrats and dictators: demonstra-
tions of military might over strategic 
partnerships and alliances. I am con-
cerned that, under this administration, 
we are inexorably trending toward a 
new nuclear arms race, where dem-
onstrations of power have taken the 
place of treaties that made the use of 
history’s most dangerous weapons less 
likely. 
Coupled with authorization to build a 
new nuclear warhead, the Senate’s fis-
cal year 2021 National Defense Author-
ization Act goes beyond the nuclear 
modernization plan set in action by the 
Obama administration in concert with 
ratifying New START. Rather, it takes 
scientifically dubious and strategically 
unnecessary steps to support the Presi-
dent’s seemingly exclusive interest in 
brandishing—literally—our 
military 
might. Congress and Presidents of both 
parties have worked for decades to help 
the world avoid repeating the precar-
ious situation of the 1960s; I worry we 
are starting a slow march back to that 
edge. 
Like many Senators, I am dis-
appointed that a simple amendment I 
have authored to provide resources 
through the Department of Defense to 
communities who are the home to sig-
nificant military missions through our 
National Guard did not receive consid-
eration. The men and women of our Na-
tional Guard are members of our com-
munities. They are our mothers and fa-
thers, our husbands and wives, our co-
workers and neighbors. The important 
missions they serve help not only our

July 23, 2020 
communities, but our national defense. 
The Department of Defense should not 
only support the men and women who 
serve in uniform, but also the commu-
nities in which they partner. This sim-
ple, straightforward amendment would 
have provided $20 million for the De-
partment of Defense to support mul-
tiple communities where certain mili-
tary missions that serve the national 
defense are based. As communities 
across the country support our mili-
tary’s missions, so, too, should our De-
partment of Defense serve their needs. 
I am also disappointed that the Sen-
ate has rejected an amendment to rein 
in the dramatically escalating budget 
of the Department of Defense. As the 
vice chairman of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee, I have worked with 
the Republican leadership and with 
Chairman SHELBY in recent years to 
strike budget agreements that have re-
sulted in parity between defense and 
nondefense spending. At the same time, 
amid a national and international pub-
lic health crisis, the time has never 
been more critical to infuse more re-
sources in public health, education, 
and business development programs. 
The Sanders amendment would have 
maintained full support for the per-
sonnel needs of the Department, as 
well as the critical medical research 
supported through the Department of 
Defense. It would, however, have also 
taken some of the Department’s sweep-
ing budget and reserved it for under-
funded domestic needs. This is long 
overdue. 
The Senate will pass this bill today, 
and we will need to reconcile dif-
ferences with the House. While I will 
not vote for the Senate bill as it cur-
rently stands, there are many provi-
sions that merit support. The bill con-
tinues a streak in recent years of im-
proving support for the health and 
safety of military servicemembers and 
their families and, this year, also au-
thorizes $44 million for vaccine and 
biotech research support for COVID–19 
response that benefits everyone. The 
bill includes limitations on the use of 
the military against protestors, fol-
lowing the administration’s actions 
against protestors in the Nation’s Cap-
itol, and the photo-op that followed. It 
includes a provision to begin the proc-
ess for renaming U.S. military facili-
ties named after Confederate generals. 
Our bases today should reflect the 
foundational belief that we are all cre-
ated equal, not glorify those who 
sought to perpetuate slavery and de-
stroy the Union. 
I am also very pleased that a project 
I have worked on many years to heal 
the wounds of the Vietnam war has 
been advanced. Over the last 2 years, 
we have included an authorization and 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
has 
funded a project to remediate dioxin 
contamination at the Bien Hoa Air-
base. This year, we also include an au-
thorization for a partnership with the 
Vietnamese Government for recovering 
remains of missing in action in Viet-
nam. For more than 40 years, the Viet-
namese Government has provided in-
dispensable assistance in locating the 
remains of more than 700 U.S. MIAs. 
This provision will enable the Depart-
ment of Defense to reciprocate by pro-
viding archival data and other assist-
ance to Vietnam. I want to thank Sen-
ators HIRONO and KAINE for their help 
in sponsoring this amendment in com-
mittee 
and 
Chairman 
INHOFE
and 
Ranking Member REED for accepting 
it. 
I hope that an agreed upon fiscal 
year 2021 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act will address these concerns. 
While I cannot vote to pass this bill 
today, I hope to be able to support a 
conference agreement that supports 
our men and women in uniform and 
their families, meets the defense needs 
of our Nation, and reflects the values 
that have made American the beacon 
of hope for generations. 
Mr. INHOFE. We are at the point now 
where I would like to make a few com-
ments, and I would like to ask our 
ranking member to make some com-
ments. This has been a long time in the 
making. 
I have said several times on the floor 
that this, in my opinion, is the most 
important bill of the year. It is some-
thing we have done every year. This 
will be the 60th consecutive year that 
we have actually done this bill. 
It is never easy. One reason it is not 
easy is because everybody knows it is 
going to pass, so people want to be a 
part of it and put their many amend-
ments that aren’t even germane on this 
bill. We are now to the point where, in 
just a few minutes, we are going to be 
voting on the final passage of the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2021. 
When Senator REED and I introduced 
this bill, we thought we had a good bill. 
The bill was really led by the Members. 
This never happened before. We started 
off with over 700 requests and amend-
ments so that the Members themselves 
have drawn this bill together. It is not 
as if it is put together by a committee; 
it was put together by all of us here in 
the Chamber. The committee approved 
it 25 to 2. That is overwhelming. I 
think everyone understands that. 
We filed it with the hopes of adding a 
few more amendments on the Senate 
floor. We did that. We added more than 
140 amendments altogether. We even 
had some debates and rollcall votes on 
amendments, something we haven’t 
done probably in the last 5 years or so. 
Now we are voting on a great bill, a 
bill that every Senator had the chance 
to make his or her remark on. Once the 
Senate passes this bill, we will still 
have more work to do. We still have to 
go over to the House and pass their 
bill. We have to go to conference with 
the House. We will do that. We have 
done that every year for many, many 
years. Our next step would be, of 
course, to do the conference. 
Then we will work to make sure, 
once again, this is a bipartisan con-
ference report that both parties can 
support and the President can sign. 
It has been bipartisan. All these 
amendments—each group amendment 
that the ranking member, Senator 
REED, yesterday talked about—were 
equally divided between Democrats and 
Republicans. I have not seen it this 
way in the past. We will make sure, 
once again, that we have the same bi-
partisan effort. 
I have said it many times over the 
past several days and several weeks 
that the NDAA is one of our most im-
portant responsibilities. There is a doc-
ument I refer to now and then that no-
body reads anymore called the Con-
stitution. In that Constitution, it tells 
us what we are supposed to be doing 
here. What we are supposed to be doing 
here is exactly what we are doing 
today. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act is how we fulfill that responsi-
bility, and we have done this every 
year for 60 years in a row now. It is a 
sacred responsibility we all have to all 
Americans, especially our troops and 
their families—those in harm’s way. 
Every day they wake up, lay their lives 
on the line to defend our Nation and 
our values and freedom, democracy, 
and peace. 
Right now, the main challenge to our 
security comes from authoritarian re-
gimes that stand against all of our val-
ues. I am talking about China and Rus-
sia and others—primarily China and 
Russia. 
The way we win against our adver-
saries is by making sure our fights 
never start by sending a strong mes-
sage that ‘‘you can’t win; don’t even 
try.’’ That is what we are doing with 
this bill. 
The National Defense Strategy Com-
mission report is significant because 
this is the second time now we have 
done this. This is a book that was put 
together by six leading Democrats, six 
leading Republicans—all very knowl-
edgeable on this issue. It is called the 
‘‘Common Defense.’’ This is what we 
have used as our blueprint. We stayed 
pure with that all the way through. 
The NDAA makes sure that we have 
the personnel, the equipment, the 
training, and the organization needed 
to support the strategy that is found in 
this book. If we get it right, we will be 
set on a steady course toward a peace-
ful, free, and prosperous world—not 
just for us but for our children and our 
grandchildren as well. Kay and I have 
been married for 60 years. We have 20 
kids and grandkids. We know some-
thing about this and the significance of 
this. 
The backbone of all of this is our 
men and women in uniform, so this bill 
is for them. The bill provides for a 3- 
percent pay raise, the largest one in 
over a decade. It also takes care of the 
families and makes sure their spouses 
have employment opportunities, chil-
dren have access to good schools and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4448 
July 23, 2020 
These are priorities that go beyond 
party. That is why this bill has passed 
for the last 59 years in a row with bi-
partisan support, and that is why we 
are going to do it again today. 
There is talk out there that people in 
Washington don’t really work that 
hard. Let me assure you, they do in 
this case. We have been blessed with a 
couple of leaders, this great committee 
we have that put this together. Those 
leaders include John Bonsell. John 
Bonsell has been working in this effort 
with me for well over 20 years, and he 
was a great leader of this group. On the 
Democratic side, the minority side, Liz 
King has worked hand in hand with 
John Bonsell. The whole team has 
worked together. 
Developing a bill that comes out of 
committee with only two dissenting 
votes is not something that is done 
every day. I want to personally thank 
those individuals on our side, and we 
will ask Senator REED to do the same 
on the minority side. 
We want to thank not just John 
Bonsell but John Wason, Tom Goffus, 
Stephanie Barna, Greg Lilly, Marta 
Hernandez, 
Rick 
Berger, 
Jennie 
Wright, 
Adam 
Barker, 
Augusta 
BinnsBerkey, 
Al 
Edwards, 
Sean 
O’Keefe, Brad Patout, Jason Potter, 
Katie Sutton, Eric Trager, Dustin 
Walker, T.C. Williams, Otis Winkler, 
Gwyneth Woolwine, Katie Magnus, Ar-
thur 
Tellis, 
Leah 
Brewer, 
Debbie 
Chiarello, 
Gary 
Howard, 
Tyler 
Wilkinson, John Bryant, Griffin Can-
non, Keri-Lyn Michalke, Soleil Sykes, 
Brittany Amador, Jillian Schofield. 
We will cover those from the minor-
ity side in just a moment. 
From my personal office: Luke Hol-
land, Andrew Forbes, Leacy Burke, 
Don Archer, Travis Tarbox—who just 
got his promotion to major yesterday— 
Brian Brody, Dan Hillenbrand, Jake 
Hinch, Devin Barrett, Laurie Fitch, 
and Whitney Fulluo. 
Lastly, from the floor staff: Robert 
Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, 
Tony 
Hanagan, 
Katherine 
Foster, 
Brian Canfield, Abigail Baker, Anna 
Carmack, and Maddie Sanborn. 
It is because of the tireless work of 
all these fine people—we are talking 
about the members of the committee, 
the personal staff, and we are talking 
about the staff in the cloakrooms—I 
want to thank them all. This is our 
only opportunity to do that. 
We are going to hear now from the 
ranking member, Senator REED, and 
then, after that, we will vote and look 
forward to this year’s NDAA passing 
with a strong bipartisan majority. 
Senator REED. 
Mr. REED. Thank you very much, 
Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. President, I rise, once again, to 
express my support for the National 
Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal 
Year 2021. I want to commend the 
chairman for his leadership and his 
thoughtfulness throughout this whole 
process. 
I am pleased, as we all are, that we 
will be voting soon on passage. I be-
lieve this is an excellent bill. I believe 
it provides the men and women of our 
military with resources and the au-
thorizations needed to defend our Na-
tion, while at the same time taking 
care of their families. It was crafted 
after a series of thoughtful hearings, 
discussion, and debate on both sides of 
the aisle. It was passed out of com-
mittee with strong bipartisan support. 
Most importantly, I am very pleased 
that this bill has had such full consid-
eration on the Senate floor. For the 
first time in a long time, we were able 
to come to an agreement to debate and 
vote on several amendments. In addi-
tion, we were able to adopt over 140 
amendments from Members on both 
sides of the aisle. 
I want to, again, thank Senator 
INHOFE for his leadership getting the 
Defense 
authorization 
bill 
to 
this 
point, overcoming the many challenges 
posed by the pandemic and by other 
factors that made this a very unusual 
year. I look forward to working with 
him as we go into conference. 
Finally, I would like to thank the 
committee staff who have worked so 
hard. I specifically want to recognize, 
as the chairman has, the staff director, 
John Bonsell, for the Republicans and 
the staff director for the Democrats, 
Elizabeth King. They worked together. 
They are diligent. They are bipartisan. 
They are thoughtful. They are the best 
examples of a staff member of the U.S. 
Senate. 
I would also like to thank my staff 
on the Democratic side: Jody Bennett, 
Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan 
Epstein, 
Jorie 
Feldman, 
Creighton 
Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, 
Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara 
Cooper, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, 
John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, Fiona 
Tomlin, and, once again, staff director 
Elizabeth King. 
Also, let me thank the floor staff and 
the leadership staff. You have been 
part of this process for the last several 
weeks, and you have done a remarkable 
job. We thank you for that very, very 
much. You facilitated our efforts. 
Finally, I would urge all of my col-
leagues to vote for this very excellent 
bill. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know 
of no further debate.

MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT—S. 4049 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that notwithstanding the pas-
sage of S. 4049, the clerk be authorized 
to correct the instruction line on 
amendment No. 2417. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (S. 2417), as modi-
fied, is as follows: 
(Purpose: To modify the requirements for 
the Department of Energy response to the 
review by the Nuclear Weapons Council of 
the budget of the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration) 
Beginning on page 1036, strike line 7 and 
all that follows through page 1037, line 8, and 
insert the following: 
‘‘(3) DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESPONSE.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the Council submits 
to the Secretary of Energy a written descrip-
tion under paragraph (2)(B)(i) with respect to 
the budget request of the Administration for

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—S. 3685 AND S.

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs be dis-
charged and the Senate proceed to the 
immediate en bloc consideration of the 
following bills: S. 3685, the Emergency 
Rental Assistance and Rental Market 
Stabilization Act, which I am a prime 
sponsor of, and S. 4097, Senator WAR-
REN’s bill, the Protecting Renters from 
Evictions and Fees Act. I further ask 
that the bills be considered read a third 
time and passed en bloc and the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, we have discussed 
this before on the floor, and I will not 
go through that entirely in my part of 
the discussion here. 
Four months ago with the CARES 
Act, we came together and unani-
mously passed a package that provided 
historic support, significant support, in 
the rental markets, as this request fo-
cuses on. I believe that in the coming 
days, we can come to that same kind of 
consensus and deal with this important 
issue. Because of that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. I am disappointed. I 
knew it was coming from Senator 
CRAPO. He is my friend, and I appre-
ciate the cooperation, but this is so 
much more serious than what we did a 
few months ago. 
We have been asking just down the 
hall—Senator MCCONNELL was just in. 
We have asked him week after week 
after week—April, May, June, half of 
July—to do something about this im-
pending problem we have. 
This is why we have to do this now. 
Tomorrow, millions of families face a 
massive cliff, and they face another 
one in a week. Right now, millions of 
Americans are in danger of losing their 
homes. In the CARES Act, we put a 
temporary moratorium on evictions 
and foreclosures for renters and home-
owners and properties with federally 
backed loans, as well as for renters re-
ceiving Federal assistance. It is a good 
thing entirely, just not enough. This 
rental eviction moratorium expires to-
morrow. 
The last thing we need—imagine this: 
In the middle of a public health crisis, 
people who get evicted roam the 
streets, or they go to an overcrowded 
shelter, or they go live in their cousin’s 
basement—all 
potentially 
spreading 
the virus. 
We know the moratorium didn’t go 
far enough. It only covered 28 percent 
of renters. We should be extending and 
expanding the moratorium. We should 
be passing my emergency rental assist-
ance bill to get people through this 
pandemic, not kicking them out on the 
streets. 
We already had a housing crisis in 
this country before the coronavirus 
hit. Many of the professions we are now 
recognizing as essential—one essential 
worker, a grocery store worker, said: 
I don’t feel essential. They call me essen-
tial. I feel expendable because I don’t make 
much money, and they don’t protect you at 
work. 
Many of those people recognized as 
essential aren’t paid enough to afford 
housing. 
Think about this: One-quarter of all 
renters—one out of four renters—before 
the pandemic were paying half or more 
of their income in rent. One thing hap-
pens in their lives, and they are on the 
streets. Now we are seeing millions of 
people all at once have those same 
emergencies. They are facing impos-
sible choices between rent and grocery 
or prescriptions or draining their sav-
ings or going to a payday lender. More 
than 40 percent—40 percent—of Black 
and Latinx renters report they are un-
likely to be able to make their next 
payment—40 percent. 
Some people don’t have any choice at 
all. Their only option is eviction. 
Those evictions are already happening 
in Columbus, the capital city in Ohio, 
the largest city in Ohio. In Columbus, 
they have turned the convention center 
into an eviction court—an eviction 
court at the convention center. More 
eviction filings will be coming if we do 
nothing. 
For all those renters who have been 
protected from eviction by the CARES 
Act, back rent will suddenly be due. 
They will owe for March and April and 
May and June. The same goes for the 
millions who aren’t protected under

July 23, 2020 
the CARES Act but got relief from a 
temporary State or local moratorium 
or court closure. 
On top of that, at the end of next 
week, the additional $600 a week in UI 
benefits expires. Senator WYDEN has 
done yeoman’s work. It is incredible 
what he was able to do for this unem-
ployment that kept millions and mil-
lions and millions—tens of thousands 
of Oregonians and hundreds of thou-
sands of Ohioans were kept in their 
homes because of this $600 unemploy-
ment check that they got weekly. Now, 
because Senator MCCONNELL
doesn’t 
care, President Trump doesn’t care, 
those people are going to lose that $600. 
What do they do then? We know that 
UI didn’t cover everyone, but for many 
people, that $600 was the difference be-
tween being able to pay their bills and 
skipping meals or draining their sav-
ings or having to turn to a payday 
lender. 
We need to extend the assistance to 
help families afford their food and pre-
scriptions. We need to provide emer-
gency rental assistance to keep a roof 
over their heads. 
This problem isn’t some distant cliff. 
We are all about to go home for the 
week. This doesn’t happen a month 
from now or 3 months from now; this 
happens starting this week. It happens 
when unemployment expires. It hap-
pens when these moratoria around the 
country expire. 
What is President Trump doing? 
What is Majority Leader MCCONNELL 
doing? Nothing. Maybe going to Mar-a- 
Lago, maybe going back to Kentucky. I 
don’t know. What are they doing about 
this impending cliff? Nothing. 
We asked them in March. We asked 
them in April, in May, and in June. 
Two-thirds of the way into July, they 
still refuse to help. 
Because of this President’s failures, 
this crisis isn’t getting any better, the 
virus continues to spread, people con-
tinue to die, small businesses continue 
to suffer. 
Why would we let up on the relief 
people need now? The work we do in 
this body to get help to people simply 
can’t make up for the lack of leader-
ship from the White House, but it can 
mitigate some of the damages. 
The House passed the Heroes Act 
nearly 2 months ago. That would have 
eliminated these cliffs. It would have 
provided $100 billion in emergency re-
lief. But do you know what? That bill 
has been on the majority leader’s desk 
collecting dust since May. 
For millions of families about to lose 
their unemployment, about to lose 
their homes, and not able to feed their 
kids, the bills keep coming, the clock 
keeps ticking, the stress keeps mount-
ing. People are tired of this lack of ac-
tion and lack of accountability. 
They are tired of being betrayed— 
‘‘betrayed’’ is the right word—betrayed 
by this President, who is supposed to 
look out for them. They are tired of 
feeling like no one is on their side. 
That is why we need to do this. 
We are supposed to be the greatest 
country on Earth. The American peo-
ple should not have to fend for them-
selves in the middle of a once-in-a-gen-
eration crisis. It is time to lead where 
the President has failed. It is time for 
Leader MCCONNELL to let us do our job. 
It is time to keep families from losing 
their homes. That is really clear. 
I yield the floor to the sponsor of this 
other bill that is so very important, 
Senator WARREN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator BROWN for the leadership on 
this. 
I am very sorry that the Republicans 
will not agree to moving forward on 
this bill today. The urgency of the mo-
ment cannot be overstated. 
President Trump’s utterly failed re-
sponse to the coronavirus pandemic 
has allowed a dangerous virus to 
spread, uncontrolled, throughout our 
Nation. More than 4 million Americans 
have contracted coronavirus, and more 
than 140,000 people are dead. 
While the death toll mounts, the 
President’s 
failure 
to 
control 
the 
spread of COVID–19 has caused a second 
crisis, following closely on the heels of 
the virus. Our economy is in shambles, 
and now we are forced to fight on two 
fronts: to keep families safe from the 
coronavirus and safe from the eco-
nomic fallout. 
So I am here on the Senate floor 
today to talk about one piece of the 
economic emergency unfolding in our 
country. Right now, we are just days 
away from a completely preventable 
housing crisis. The CARES Act evic-
tion moratorium is currently pro-
tecting more than 12 million renters 
from losing their homes while the virus 
rages across our country. On Friday at 
midnight, those protections will dis-
appear, allowing a tsunami of evictions 
that will hit communities of color and 
low-income families the hardest unless 
we act now. 
Let us be clear. Eviction is not a new 
problem in this country. Too many 
families were already on the financial 
brink before the virus crashed our 
economy. Close to 40 percent of adults 
don’t have enough cash to cover an un-
expected $400 expense. More than half 
of households didn’t have enough sav-
ings to cover 3 months without income. 
More than one in four renters were 
paying more than half of their income 
to housing. 
Now families are facing the worst 
economic crisis of their lifetime. About 
30 million Americans are officially un-
employed or out of work. One-half of 
all Americans have lost employment 
income since the start of this pan-
demic, and communities of color have 
been hit the hardest. It is not possible 
to fix this economy without containing 
the virus, but we can make sure that 
millions of Americans don’t lose their 
homes because President Trump closed 
his eyes and hoped that the pandemic 
would just go away. 
This is really a commonsense solu-
tion. My bill, the Protecting Renters 
from Evictions and Fees Act, would ex-
tend the Federal eviction moratorium 
through March of 2021, and it would ex-
pand the moratorium to protect every 
single renter. 
Congress should pass this bill imme-
diately, and we should pair it with Sen-
ator BROWN’s bill to create a $100 bil-
lion emergency rental assistance fund 
to help struggling renters make their 
payments. Families would get the help 
they need to stay in their homes and 
stay current on their rent, and land-
lords would get their payments. This 
would help families. It would cover 
landlords, and it would help protect 
renters and communities from the 
spread of coronavirus. 
So the answer is really simple. The 
Senate can—and must—pass these two 
bills today because the consequences of 
inaction would be devastating. 
More than one out of every three 
renters have already missed a housing 
payment. More than one-third of rent-
ers have little or no confidence that 
they can make the next payment. 
And let’s be clear about who is most 
at risk. Closer to half of Black and 
Latinx renters aren’t sure they will be 
able to make the next housing pay-
ment. Black Americans are already 
more likely to be renters because of 
decades of racist Federal policies that 
denied Black families Federally in-
sured mortgages, and our government 
failed to protect Black homeowners 
from predatory mortgages leading up 
to the great recession. So when the 
economy crashed, millions of Black 
Americans lost their homes, wiping out 
nearly all of the gains in Black home-
ownership since the 1968 Fair Housing 
Act. 
Failing to institute an eviction mor-
atorium would further deepen existing 
racial injustices. Letting eviction pro-
tections evaporate at midnight on Fri-
day will also result in widespread hous-
ing disruption and needlessly cause 
long-term harm to millions of families’ 
future housing, financial stability, and 
their health. It will put more families 
at risk of homelessness at a time when 
providers are already stretching every 
dollar to connect unhoused Americans 
with sheltering resources, and it will 
take away one of the most critical pro-
tections from furthering the spread of 
coronavirus: safe, stable housing. 
President Trump’s shameful inaction 
has 
allowed 
this 
virus 
to 
spread 
throughout every community in our 
country. He has denied the scope and 
seriousness of this pandemic. He has 
dismissed calls to take lifesaving ac-
tion, and he has refused to use the pow-
ers of the Federal Government to im-
plement even the most basic mitiga-
tion measures. 
But crisis does not stop growing just 
because those in power refuse to ac-
knowledge it. That is true for the 
spread of the coronavirus, and it is also 
true for the looming eviction crisis. 
This is about our values. The Senate 
has the opportunity—right now—to

stop a massive wave of evictions that 
will displace families right in the mid-
dle of a global pandemic. My colleagues 
understood the stakes in March when 
Congress passed the existing eviction 
moratorium into law. I urge them to 
join me now in continuing this life-
saving 
protection 
while 
providing 
emergency rental assistance to keep 
renters housed, landlords paid, and 
most of all, to keep families safe. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4143 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Fi-
nance be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 4143; that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, the CARES 
Act provides an additional $600 per 
week to those who are receiving, 
through their States, unemployment 
insurance. In Wyoming we have a gen-
erous unemployment insurance pro-
gram to help people who are out of 
work, and the CARES Act adds to that, 
essentially, a bonus payment of $600 
additional per week. For a 40-hour 
workweek, that comes down to an av-
erage of about a $15-an-hour bonus for 
not being able to go back to work, and 
that is on top of their regular unem-
ployment benefits. 
Well, since the CARES Act has 
passed, what we have seen is that this 
additional $600 per week means that 
most recipients are paid more for not 
working than they would make if they 
actually were on the job working. This 
fact has been confirmed by news re-
ports, by academic researchers, and by 
the Congressional Budget Office. 
Even former Obama administration 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Tim 
Geithner, 
along with President Obama’s Chair of 
the Council of Economic Advisers, 
agrees that $600 per week on top of un-
employment insurance through the 
States is too much. 
We have ‘‘help wanted’’ signs all 
around my State. I talked to the people 
at unemployment insurance, who run 
the program. They tell me that they 
are having many people who are get-
ting paid much more than if they 
would work, if they would take the 
jobs where you have employers out 
there hoping, looking for employees to 
come and work. 
You can’t continue to pay people 
more to not work than to work. Yet in-
stead of trying to address this identifi-
able and correctible problem, today my 
colleagues are asking that we vote to 
extend the $600-per-week bonus pay-
ments and continue these untargeted 
payments for many months into the fu-
ture. 
As a matter of fact, NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, living on Fan-
tasy Island, wants to extend these for 6 
more months, all the way until the end 
of January. The CBO and other re-
searchers and economists have looked 
at this and said this would be a heavy 
wet blanket on the economy. It would 
prevent 10 million people from going 
back to work—going all the way until 
the end of January. 
It is likely that such a proposal 
would cost $1 trillion—$1 trillion—and 
much of that is we are talking about 
paying people to not work instead of 
helping people work. 
So I hope my colleagues will join me 
in better targeting help to the unem-
ployed in a way that doesn’t pay people 
more when they are sitting at home 
not working than they would make at 
work. 
We are working on a plan now to pro-
vide additional help for the unem-
ployed if they can’t go back to work 
because their job isn’t there, isn’t 
available; if, for health purposes, they 
can’t go back to work; but do it in a 
way that the Democrats have claimed 
that they want to do but haven’t even 
proposed. We need to make it much 
more closely aligned with lost wages. 
So we are going to be introducing 
this plan shortly, and I hope my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
will engage with us in that effort. 
For these reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
going to get into the substance of my 
colleague’s arguments in a moment, 
but I just want to be clear to all the 
people in America, the 30-plus million 
who are having problems making rent, 
having problems buying groceries, who 
in just 2 days—2 days—come Saturday, 
are going to be in a position where, 
based on what they tell me, they are 
telling their kids: Hey, you probably 
have to eat a little bit less because the 
unemployment is ending. 
The fact is, the other body passed a 
bill so that folks would be able to make 
rent and buy groceries. On this side of 
the aisle, the Democratic leader and I 
introduced legislation to tie the bene-
fits to economic conditions on the 
ground. One of the reasons we did is my 
colleagues on the other side said that 
benefits ought to taper off if unemploy-
ment goes down. That is what our bill 
does. 
But here is the message that I think 
folks who are walking on an economic 
tightrope this weekend need to hear. 
On this side of the aisle, we have been 
ready to go for weeks—essentially, 
months—to have bipartisan negotia-
tions to work this issue out. As of this 
afternoon, with benefits expiring in 2 
days, the other side of the aisle has no 
piece of legislation on offer. Let me re-
peat that: no piece of legislation on 
offer. 
Let me repeat that—no piece of legis-
lation on offer. On this side of the 
aisle, they write lots of bills to help 
multinational 
corporations—lots 
of 
bills to help the powerful and the spe-
cial interests, but as of this afternoon, 
there is not a bill to help those folks 
who this weekend are going to be say-
ing: We are not going to be able to 
make rent in a few days. We are not 
going to be able to feed our families, 
not going to be able to pay for the car 
insurance. People aren’t spending this 
money on luxuries. They are spending 
it on essentials. To a great extent, they 
kept the economy afloat for the last 
few months. 
The other point I want to make is 
that this did not have to happen. Not 
only do we have legislation ready to 
discuss with our colleagues that incor-
porates some of their ideas, we have 
been reaching out again and again. Yet 
MITCH
MCCONNELL, who took all of 
July off when he could have been get-
ting this piece of legislation together— 
those big 2 weeks, and he could have 
been getting the legislation together— 
basically, actively—didn’t happen by 
osmosis—actively gave short shrift to 
the needs of the unemployed and made 
no effort, none whatever, even though 
we reached out continually to Repub-
licans, saying that this weekend—and 
the pain that working families have 
this weekend didn’t have to happen. We 
wanted to do everything we can, work-
ing with our colleagues, to prevent it. 
Now, for purposes of this discussion, I 
want to make sure people understand 
what this discussion really means to 
working families in this country. I was 
at home, at food banks and the like— 
lines for blocks—people who had never 
needed to go to a pantry or a food pro-
gram were waiting in line because they 
had been hit by this economic wreck-
ing ball. 
There are people who are worried 
about losing their homes and losing 
their cars, being unable to fill their 
prescriptions. As I mentioned, think 
about what it means when you have to 
tell your kid you ought to eat less be-
cause they don’t know whether they 
will have enough cash to stock the pan-
try next month. 
As I said, Republicans’ response to 
this over the last few days—last few 
weeks—I went to school on a basket-
ball scholarship, and I remember when 
you could basically play stall ball, go 
into four corners offense, basically run 
down the clock. And then at the end, as 
my distinguished colleague from Wyo-
ming tried to do, say: Well, it is the 
fault of the poor people. It is the fault 
of those poor people. I am going to 
touch on what this really is all about. 
When we began the negotiations—and 
I was the point person for the Demo-
crats—in the Finance room—I offered 
basic wage replacement as our position 
for dealing with this issue. Secretary of 
Labor Scalia said: It can’t be done. The 
States can’t administer it. Western civ-
ilization is pretty much going to end if 
we try to do this. And then he folded 
his arms, and, for days, basically re-
fused to negotiate about alternatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4452 
July 23, 2020 
Understand that we started with the 
approach of basic wage replacement. 
Secretary Scalia said it can’t be done. 
States are stuck with old technology. I 
didn’t disagree with that. Gave a bil-
lion dollars to the States to help them 
update technology too. I said: We are 
not going to tell those workers, Mr. 
Scalia, to pound sand. 
I basically said we are going to aver-
age the benefit—$600. Some people will 
get a bit more than they would; some 
people are going to get a bit less, but 
families are going to have a chance, 
based on what the State employment 
offices told us, to actually get benefits. 
I know that it hasn’t worked out too 
well in the State of Florida—the Presi-
dent of the Senate, and I am sure he 
will want to talk about this in the de-
bate—but at least millions of people in 
this country got a chance to make 
rent, buy groceries, pay medicine be-
cause we said we are going to take a 
sum of money that the States told us 
they can actually, for the most part, 
administer. 
The Finance Committee held a hear-
ing on unemployment insurance this 
summer. I particularly wanted to know 
how we might look at administering 
these benefits in the future because I 
knew that we would all want to hear if 
there had been reforms and what the 
case might be for changes. During that 
hearing just a few weeks ago, the Na-
tional Association of State Workforce 
Agencies—the experts on this issue on 
how the benefits are to be adminis-
tered—said that—their words—any re-
duction or change in benefits will abso-
lutely lead to a lapse in benefits. 
You would think colleagues on the 
other side would say: My goodness. We 
don’t want that to happen. These State 
workforce agencies said there would be 
a lapse in benefits no matter what you 
cut, $100, whatever the amount was, 
there would be a lapse in benefits. The 
gap in benefits could last a week or 
two, potentially, up to a month. I have 
been pointing out to Senators you 
can’t eat retroactivity. And yet, every-
thing I have heard that colleagues 
want to do now—remember, they don’t 
have a bill. They do not have a bill. 
They are taking the weekend off. We 
have a bill on this side. The Demo-
cratic leader, myself—supported by our 
caucus—we have a bill. We are ready to 
talk. They don’t have a bill to do any-
thing for those people who are going to 
be hurting this weekend. 
After that hearing, you would have 
thought people—Republican Senators 
on the other side—would say, you 
know, we have to figure out what to do. 
We have to make sure that people 
aren’t going to fall between the cracks, 
through no fault of their own. Remem-
ber, so many of them are at home be-
cause of government policies, the quar-
antine, and the—of course, the pattern 
is particularly ominous now because 
folks who were furloughed at the begin-
ning, then got brought back, and now 
with the spike, they are getting laid off 
again. There you have it—National As-
sociation of State Workforce Agencies 
says that any change can lead to a 
lapse in benefits. 
I guess my colleagues on the other 
side walked out there and said: No big 
deal. It is just a few weeks. Tell that to 
the people who aren’t going to have 
enough money to make rent and buy 
groceries next week. Tell that to their 
face rather than just leave town and 
say: We will talk about it another 
time, and we will see about 2, 3, 4 
weeks and what people are going to 
have to do without this lifeline, which 
I believe is going to be a disaster. 
The lapse that is being forced on this 
country right now is because Senate 
Republicans would not step up. They 
would not step up along the way—after 
the hearing, during the July break. 
They did not step up. The lapse is 
going to lead to eviction; it is going to 
lead to hunger; it is going to lead to 
desperation for millions of Americans. 
And the only way to avoid it is by act-
ing now, by passing the American 
Workforce Rescue Act that Senator 
SCHUMER
and I introduced. We just 
tried to pass it. 
If our bill had passed, the people who 
are going to be hurting this weekend, 
who aren’t going to be able to make 
rent, who aren’t going to be able to buy 
groceries—would have some sense of se-
curity. They would be able to go to bed 
at night this weekend, had our bill 
passed, knowing that there would be an 
opportunity to work with the other 
body and get this resolved and get it 
resolved quickly. 
Now those people know one thing, 
and that is that they better plan for 
yet more uncertainty and more pain. 
As my colleagues say, maybe it will get 
worked out in a few weeks—even 
though what they are talking about 
working out—and remember, there is 
no bill. We have never seen a piece of 
paper, but they are talking about cut-
ting the lifeline over 50 percent. That 
is their proposal—cutting it more than 
50 percent. 
At a minimum—at a minimum, I be-
lieve, that what the Republicans are 
now looking at is some kind of ap-
proach that after Secretary Scalia has 
told the Senate that the States can’t 
do full wage replacement for individual 
workers; that they are not capable of 
doing it; the technology is too old; it 
can’t get the math; it can’t get individ-
ually tailored benefits out in a timely 
way—apparently, my colleagues are 
using that model for their so-called 
idea that they want to talk about. 
I have already mentioned the fact 
that they believe the argument for this 
is that it could be done in a few weeks. 
People are going to be hurting for 
those few weeks. Nobody has an answer 
to that. Everybody ought to under-
stand that I was the first one to offer 
full wage replacement—I would say to 
the President of the Senate—and it was 
Secretary Scalia who said it couldn’t 
be administered and has never changed 
his mind on that point. 
My view is, the proposal that adds a 
whole lot of complexity to the unem-
ployment system is a proposal designed 
to fail. That, apparently, is what Sen-
ate Republicans are talking about. 
At a minimum, this delay in the Sen-
ate is going to cause a lapse in bene-
fits. On top of that, it has been re-
ported the Republicans could attempt 
to cut the benefit by well over 50 per-
cent. 
I just ask, how can anybody look at 
the State of the country and how pow-
erful people and special interests can 
be doing so well and then decide to cut 
the economic lifeline for working fami-
lies by well over 50 percent when the 
country is in the middle of a pandemic, 
when there are 60- or 70,000 new COVID 
cases every day and climbing, when 
there are 800, 900, 1,000 COVID cases 
every day and climbing, when the num-
ber of new unemployment claims, 
which before this year had never 
crossed 700,000, has been 1.3 million or 
higher for 18 straight weeks, and, in 
fact, the number of new claims went up 
this week for the first time since 
April—a sign that the recovery is going 
in reverse. 
As I mentioned, what I am hearing 
about at home are businesses that re-
opened in May and June and are laying 
off their workers for a second time. 
One-third 
of 
Americans 
couldn’t 
make their last rent payment. Parents 
who lost their jobs are wondering how 
they are going to feed their children. I 
just say to my colleagues who may be 
who may be following this, this is an 
unthinkable level of pain and suffering 
and uncertainty to needlessly inflict on 
30 million Americans. 
It is not just about those who have 
already lost work. It is about the mil-
lions of others who are worried that 
their pink slip might come in August 
or September or October. They need 
support too. In fact, the papers are full 
of stories of small businesses closing 
and closing permanently. I expect that 
all those people are worried that they 
haven’t been laid off yet, but a pink 
slip may be coming their way in Au-
gust or September or October. They 
may have a word or two for their Sen-
ators who are able to find plenty of 
time to write bills to help multi-
national corporations but can’t find 
the time to stand up for unemployed 
folks who are hurting. 
Before I wrap up this afternoon, I 
want to touch on this argument that 
Republicans have been flogging away 
on for months now that these unem-
ployment benefits are way too gen-
erous, and, somehow, they are con-
vinced that it makes sense to insult 
the American worker and say that all 
these workers are sitting around lazily 
at home instead of going back to work. 
That argument does not pass the smell 
test. 
I am going to be very specific about 
why that argument trotted out again 
by my friend from Wyoming is way off 
base. 
First of all, the same Republicans 
who celebrated the May and June job 
reports are now talking about how lazy

workers are by refusing to go back to 
their jobs. You simply cannot have it 
both ways. 
Second, not one of my Republican 
colleagues brought forward real evi-
dence to suggest that workers across 
the country are turning down work. 
These anecdotes just don’t hold water. 
According to one recent analysis, more 
than two-thirds of workers who were 
hired in June went back to jobs that 
paid less than supercharged unemploy-
ment benefits. 
Third, it is an insult to American 
workers to say that they would rather 
sit at home than to earn their pay at 
work. 
If any one of my Republican col-
leagues were to go out and meet the 
Oregonians I have spoken to and who 
have been furloughed or laid off during 
the pandemic, they will hear from peo-
ple who desperately want to go back to 
their jobs when it is safe. These are 
people who believe in the dignity of 
work and people who want to provide 
for their families. It is an insult to call 
them lazy. 
I want to inject a note of reality into 
this because my Republican colleagues 
have been so fixated on this argument. 
I have talked to a lot of unemployed 
workers. I said: Back east, the Senate 
Republicans say all unemployed folks 
are lazy, and they don’t want to work 
and all the rest. 
So many of the unemployed look at 
me incredulous, and they say: Ron, ask 
them how in the world have they came 
up with that completely wrong idea. 
They usually say: If I am given a 
choice between unemployment or the 
chance to have a job in the private 
economy, where I have a future and 
where I can build upward economic mo-
bility—they usually say: Ron, tell 
those Republicans in Washington, DC, 
it is a no-brainer; of course, I am going 
to take the job that gives me an oppor-
tunity for a future, the chance to work 
in the private sector and climb the lad-
der of economic mobility. I am going 
to take that every time, rather than 
unemployment, which has been uncer-
tain. 
That is my response to the off-base 
kind of argument presented by Senator 
BARRASSO. If Republicans want to go 
home this weekend and insult the work 
ethic of millions of Americans who be-
lieve in the dignity of work, that is 
their constitutional right. 
The country, obviously, is nowhere 
near the end of this pandemic. Busi-
nesses are going to keep closing—some 
temporarily, others permanently. We 
are looking at the worst unemploy-
ment crisis since the Great Depression. 
The benefits we put together ini-
tially, the supercharged unemployment 
benefits—and I am especially proud 
that we said that as for the law, which 
really hadn’t been updated since the 
1930s, that we would modernize the law 
and allow gig workers and the self-em-
ployed and independent contractors 
and part-timers to be brought into the 
system. Those supercharged benefits 
that we negotiated in the Finance 
Committee room—which, by the way, 
were signed off by Secretary Mnuchin. 
This was not done in the dead of night 
with only one side going along with the 
effort. These were negotiated with Sec-
retary Mnuchin, who actually endorsed 
it at a press conference. These super-
charged unemployment benefits have 
been the one thing that has kept mil-
lions of families—millions of families— 
from being in a position where they 
couldn’t feed their families, couldn’t 
make rent, and, literally, facing the 
kind of despair, the kind of fear that 
has made the number of requests for 
mental health services go through the 
stratosphere because people are so wor-
ried. And this question of their eco-
nomic future is just one reason. 
Supercharged unemployment bene-
fits have helped keep the economy 
afloat and have helped prevent true 
economic meltdowns. And even with 
the lifeline, so many are barely hang-
ing on. They fall behind on their bills. 
I mentioned the threat of hunger. Sen-
ator BROWN just talked about how im-
portant it is to act on housing assist-
ance. 
It would be a historic failure, mor-
ally and economically, to slash this 
lifeline that is so important to getting 
workers through a pandemic. The 
Democratic leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
and I listened carefully to all sides. We 
thought about the need, given the fact 
that there are predictions of high un-
employment for some time to come. 
We said: Let’s come up with a depend-
able safety net that provides some 
measure of predictability with respect 
to how the government is going to ap-
proach these issues in the future. 
My colleagues have said that they 
want a system that has the benefits 
taper off as unemployment goes down. 
Well, what the Democratic leader and I 
have proposed does exactly that. 
I believe that yesterday there was a 
story in the Washington Post where, I 
think, they were talking about unem-
ployment at 15 percent. When unem-
ployment reaches those kinds of lev-
els—and we saw that story of people 
waiting and waiting for hours. In fact, 
I don’t have the exact percentage. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the story about the unem-
ployment calamity in Oklahoma be 
printed in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

‘A VERY DARK FEELING’: HUNDREDS CAMP 
OUT IN OKLAHOMA UNEMPLOYMENT LINES 
(By Annie Gowen) 
TULSA.—John Jolley never thought he’d be 
sleeping in his car awaiting unemployment 
benefits. But there he was, the owner of a 
once-successful advertising agency, taking a 
sweaty nap in a Subaru wagon in a conven-
tion center parking lot at 1:45 a.m. on a 
Wednesday. 
The pandemic sent his business into a free 
fall, and now Jolley wanted to be first in line 
for an unemployment claims event beginning 
in five hours. He barely dozed, afraid that if 
he fell into a deep sleep, he would miss the 
early-morning handout of tickets for ap-
pointments with state agents. 
There would be just 400 tickets handed out 
for that day’s event. When those ran out, 
there would be 400 more for appointments 
the following day. 
‘‘I just didn’t want to be number 803,’’ 
Jolley said. 
In the four months since the pandemic 
began, nearly 50 million workers have filed 
unemployment claims nationwide, a flood 
that’s overwhelmed some states, freezing an-
tiquated computer systems and jamming 
websites and phone lines for days. State ben-
efit agencies in some parts of the country 
have evoked memories of Great Depression 
bread lines. 
Many have been struggling to get their 
regular unemployment benefits as well as 
the $600–a-week federal pandemic unemploy-
ment assistance passed in March that begins 
running out for millions of Americans later 
this week. Congress returned Monday to 
begin hammering out the details of another 
massive coronavirus bill, with Republicans 
assembling a $1 trillion package that prob-
ably will extend but reduce the size of that 
benefit. Democrats are backing a more wide- 
ranging $3 trillion relief bill passed by the 
House in May. 
In Oklahoma, one of the poorest states, un-
employment—which reached a record 14.7 
percent in April—has pushed many to the 
point of desperation, with savings depleted, 
cars repossessed and homes sold for cash. 
Even 
though 
the 
unemployment 
rate 
dropped to 6.6 percent in June, the backlog 
has created unprecedented delays. Oklahoma 
had approved 235,000 of about 590,000 filed 
claims by June 21—a total $2–4 billion pay-
out, far more than in previous years. About 
6,000 state claims are pending. 
The Oklahoma Employment Security Com-
mission staff has tried to combat the delays 
by holding mega-processing events at large 
arenas in Oklahoma City and Tulsa this 
month, with masks and social distancing re-
quired. So far, they’ve managed to help 6,200 
people. Jolley’s unemployment claim was ap-
proved in March but had been stalled, a prob-
lem that hadn’t been fixed after nine phone 
calls and hours on hold with the OESC. 
The 58-year-old single father arrived in the 
parking lot of the River Spirit Expo center 
in Tulsa around 9 p.m. on a sultry night with 
a heat index approaching 100 degrees. The 
landmark 75-foot statue of the Golden 
Driller—a nod to Tulsa’s oil and gas hub— 
towered over one side of the dark parking 
lot, his face painted over with a surgical 
mask. 
Dozens more sat in the parking lot over-
night with Jolley, unable to get their ques-
tions answered through the unemployment 
agency’s overloaded phone system. Some 
said they had been notified that their claim 
was denied as fraudulent. Jolley quickly 
bonded with the woman in the next car over, 
a manicurist named Cindy La, 60, the two 
swapping tips on how they thought the event 
would unfold. 
That afternoon, as Jolley gathered up the 
paperwork he’d need for his claim, he felt a 
sense of sadness as profound as anything he’d 
felt since the pandemic began. 
‘‘It’s a very dark feeling,’’ he said. ‘‘You 
just kind of feel like you’re in a boat without 
a rudder and you’re riding the waves. After 
all these years you worked hard at your 
company, tried to be a good guy and be fair 
to your clients, you just feel like you’re los-
ing control of your future.’’ 
OLD COMPUTERS, NEW CAREERS 
At 4:30 a.m., several OESC staffers emerged 
from the convention center to hand out the 
appointment numbers. The process quickly

July 23, 2020 
degenerated into a free-for-all, the crowd 
growing restive, pushing and shoving to get 
the limited supply of appointment tickets. 
Jolley moved to the front of the line, trying 
to protect his new friend, La, by reaching 
down and plucking two tickets—No. 69 for 
her and No. 64 for him. 
Others were not so lucky. The numbers 
quickly ran out, and people were told they 
had to return the following day. Eventually, 
staffers referred people to the three new 
events added for the coming week because of 
the demand. 
Ashley Love, 31, a former customer advo-
cate for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, had risen at 
4 a.m. to take her 2-year-old daughter to her 
mother’s home before heading to the conven-
tion center, only to be told she had to come 
back the next day. She was laid off in March, 
when the pandemic nearly obliterated the 
travel industry. Her benefits inexplicably 
stopped four weeks ago, the agency website 
saying only she was on a ‘‘verification hold.’’ 
‘‘It’s appalling, I don’t understand how 
they can do this to people,’’ Love said. ‘‘One 
day, I called 15 times in two hours, and they 
either don’t answer or take your calls and 
hang up on you.’’ 
Love was getting down to the last she has, 
having run through $4,000 in savings. Even 
before her benefits froze, she was getting 
only about $137 a week, plus $600 a week from 
the federal government’s pandemic emer-
gency assistance program, due to expire 
around the end of the month. Her regular 
monthly bills—rent, car payment, insur-
ance—are $2,091. 
She has continued her search for a job, 
even contemplating whether she should 
‘‘Find 
Something 
New’’—as 
the 
White 
House’s 
new 
ad 
campaign 
suggests—re-
searching how she could get certification to 
start a career in teaching. 
Shelley Zumwalt, the interim director of 
Oklahoma’s unemployment agency, said the 
state’s system uses a mainframe computer 
from 1978 that was quickly overwhelmed by 
the volume of claims. ‘‘My first day, I sat 
down with one of the claims agents and said, 
‘Show me what you do,’ and a green screen 
popped up and she pushed F9,’’ Zumwalt said. 
‘‘That was the clearest thing to me that I 
was dealing with a technology that was older 
than I am.’’ 
She launched the series of more than a 
dozen mega-events July 1 after several days 
in June when desperate people began show-
ing up to the OESC office in Oklahoma City 
and waiting in line with coolers, camp chairs 
and tents. 
‘‘I’m not okay with people having to camp 
out to get their claims processed,’’ Zumwalt 
said. 
Some who showed up at the event had re-
ceived notes from the OESC that they had 
been approved for unemployment benefits 
when they hadn’t yet applied, convinced 
they had been victims of fraud. Zumwalt said 
that about 90,000 claims have been flagged as 
fraudulent. 
Last month, the U.S. Labor Department’s 
Office of Inspector General, working with the 
OESC, said it had stopped payment on 3,800 
unemployment insurance claims, including 
1,300 filed from IP addresses in London, sav-
ing the state nearly $16 million. 
Many real Oklahomans in need of assist-
ance are suffering through the complicated 
unemployment process, too. The state has 
rejected more than half of the unemploy-
ment claims filed through June 21, some for 
gig or self-employed workers who must be 
denied regular unemployment insurance be-
fore they can qualify for the federal govern-
ment’s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, 
Zumwalt said. 
Many who showed up at the Tulsa conven-
tion center were navigating government as-
sistance for the first time, such as Sarah 
Miller, 29, a single mother of three who was 
told not to come back to her job as a nursing 
home aide after she experienced symptoms 
consistent with covid–19 in March. Her un-
employment claim has been pending since 
April 12. 
‘‘I need this. I need it,’’ she said. ‘‘I’ve 
never been one to do unemployment, but 
with all that’s going on, I don’t really have 
any other option. I have to be home with my 
kids; I can’t afford to pay a babysitter or do 
day care. Got to do what I got to do.’’ 
‘WE’RE ALL GLITCHES’ 
Jolley had time to go home before his 6:30 
a.m. appointment, shower and change into 
cargo shorts and a shirt printed with tiny 
steaks and barbecues. He was among the 
first into the cavernous Expo center, where 
claims seekers sat down in folding chairs six 
feet apart. 
Staffers handed out bottles of water, Kind 
granola bars and a flier that advertised 
drive-up distribution at the local food pan-
try, ‘‘Soup’s On at the Community Kitchen.’’ 
Jolley tucked the flier along with other doc-
uments in a blue folder he labeled ‘‘Unem-
ployment.’’ 
As he waited for his name and number to 
be called, Jolley looked around at the others 
sitting in their socially distanced chairs and 
was reminded of the animated Disney movie 
‘‘Wreck-It Ralph,’’ which he watches with 
his 7-year-old, Pearl. In it, Ralph is a lum-
bering video game villain who hopes to re-
start his life by helping a video game prin-
cess stuck in a computer glitch. 
In a way, everyone in this room is a glitch, 
he said, just like Princess Vanellope in the 
movie. 
‘‘People that are here, we’re all glitches,’’ 
he said. ‘‘We fell through the cracks. The 
computer system didn’t work for us.’’ 
Jolley has a degree in petroleum engineer-
ing but started Big Guys Inc. advertising in 
1995 as a hedge against the ups and downs of 
the oil market. For a long time, the com-
pany provided a good living, even during the 
2008 recession. He sells ad space for mom- 
and-pop businesses—tree trimmers, DUI law-
yers—posted in bathrooms in airports, res-
taurants and concert venues. 
‘‘It’s a captive audience with disposable in-
come,’’ he quipped, that old joke. ‘‘Or it was 
before this.’’ 
He had always thought he would do this 
until he retired, especially after life dealt 
him the surprise of Pearl and he became a 
single dad at 50. Now, he was just hoping his 
misfortune would be temporary, that busi-
ness would revive as things normalized, with 
concerts and other events supposed to re-
start in Oklahoma in August. 
When his name was called, he went behind 
black curtains where claims agents were 
working on their ancient computer program. 
He gave a written summary of his many con-
tacts with the agency to Ashley Testerman, 
an agent in a black cotton mask. 
‘‘I brought a cheat sheet,’’ he said. 
‘‘You have no payments; let’s see if you are 
in the system,’’ she said. 
In the end, after all that—the numerous 
phone calls, the hours wasted on hold, the 
evening spent sleeping in his car—all he 
needed was a working PIN number, and 
Jolley was able to file claims for all the 
weeks he had missed since April. 
‘‘I feel so relieved,’’ he said afterward, jok-
ing that he might do a Jed Clampett-like jig 
in the parking lot on his way out the door. 
But the joy would be temporary. His last so-
bering exchange with the claims agent stuck 
in his mind. 
‘‘We don’t know what the future holds,’’ he 
had said. ‘‘What happens if everything shuts 
down again?’’ 
What then? 
Mr. WYDEN. I close by way of saying 
that I came to the floor some time ago 
to ask unanimous consent to make 
sure that this weekend, when millions 
of people are hurting—remember, the 
suffering starts in 2 days. It starts on 
Saturday—2 days in Florida, in Oregon, 
in Wyoming, and all over the country. 
MITCH
MCCONNELL’s 
response 
was: 
Let’s take a break; we can take off. He 
didn’t seem to see those hurting people 
in Kentucky. Maybe they will have 
something to say to him this weekend. 
I will tell you, I think it is a big mis-
take for Senate Republicans to have 
frittered away weeks on end, when we 
could have had a dialogue and we could 
have talked about ideas. 
The Presiding Officer has talked to 
me a number of times since he has been 
here about healthcare. I enjoy talking 
to my colleagues and working on ideas 
to try to find a way to address concerns 
and solve problems. There wasn’t one 
single effort—not one—to pick up on 
any of the ideas that I have been dis-
cussing here. In fact, I tried to reach 
out to colleagues on the other side and 
told them that I heard them say re-
peatedly that benefits should taper 
down as the unemployment rate goes 
down. Well, that is the heart of our bill 
on this side. 
The hurt and pain that working fami-
lies are going to face this Saturday and 
Sunday—2 days from now—did not 
have to happen. It didn’t have to hap-
pen. Our side has a bill to work on. The 
other side, I gather, has some ideas. We 
have not seen a single piece of paper, 
but I know that all those people who 
are hurting can’t eat retroactively. 
They can’t eat all the Republican theo-
ries about delay and haggling. 
I believe these working families de-
serve a whole lot better. They deserve 
some predictability and certainty that 
when they are hurting—through no 
fault of their own—their government 
isn’t going to turn its back on them 
and say: We don’t care if your kids 
can’t eat and you don’t have a roof 
over your head. Our country has al-
ways been better than that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
CARES 2 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as I 
said on Tuesday, our Nation stands at 
a critical midway point in our fight 
against the coronavirus. We made it 
through 
the 
springtime 
lockdowns. 
Americans’ sacrifices saved our med-
ical system. The Senate’s historic 
CARES Act helped millions of families 
make it through, but this terrible virus 
is still with us. It kills more Americans 
every day. Some areas that have re-
opened have seen cases spike. Our hos-
pitals, healthcare providers, and espe-
cially our vulnerable citizens are no-
where near out of the woods. 
Meanwhile, although the early days 
of our economic recovery have beaten 
expectations and surprised the experts, 
we have really only begun to repair the

damage. More than 17 million Ameri-
cans are still jobless. Far too many 
families are still hurting. This is not 
over. America’s fight continues, so 
Congress’s support for our people must 
continue as well. 
The Senate majority has assembled a 
framework for CARES 2. The adminis-
tration has requested additional time 
to review the fine details, but we will 
be laying down this proposal early next 
week. We have an agreement in prin-
ciple on the shape of the package. It is 
the framework that will enable Con-
gress to make law and deliver more re-
lief to the American people that is tai-
lored precisely to this phase of the cri-
sis. 
Chairmen 
GRASSLEY, 
ALEXANDER, 
COLLINS, RUBIO, SHELBY, and BLUNT, 
and Senators CORNYN and ROMNEY have 
each spearheaded a part of CARES 2. 
On Monday, these committee chairmen 
and Republican Members will intro-
duce each component. The sum of these 
efforts will be a strong, targeted piece 
of legislation aimed directly at the 
challenges we face right now. 
Our country is in a middle ground be-
tween the strict lockdowns of a few 
months ago and the future day when a 
vaccine will put all of this, finally, be-
hind us. Our project now is to build a 
middle ground that is smart and safe 
but more sustainable. 
We are still waging a healthcare war 
against the virus, and we cannot let up 
on that. We need to continue to 
strengthen the defenses we have built— 
encouraging mask-wearing, supporting 
testing, and racing toward treatments 
and vaccines. 
At the same time, the greatest coun-
try in world history also needs to get 
back on offense. We need to carefully 
but proactively step back toward nor-
malcy. This disease has already stolen 
the lives of more than 140,000 Ameri-
cans. It has stolen a half a year of our 
national life. We cannot let the robbery 
continue without a fight. We cannot let 
this pandemic rob us indefinitely of our 
children’s educations and the liveli-
hoods of 17 million American workers. 
We need to get Americans back to 
work and school while continuing to 
fight for our Nation’s health. That is 
what CARES 2 is designed to do. Our 
proposal will not waste the American 
people’s time with go-nowhere socialist 
fantasies. We aren’t choreographing po-
litical stunts or teeing up the same old 
partisan trench warfare. Our proposal 
will focus on three things: kids, jobs, 
and healthcare. 
No. 1, kids. A functioning society 
needs to educate its children and young 
adults. Our kids need us to invest in 
their futures, and working parents 
need some certainty. We need as many 
K–12 schools, colleges, and universities 
as possible to be safely welcoming stu-
dents this fall. 
Chairman 
ALEXANDER, 
Chairman 
SHELBY, and Chairman BLUNT are final-
izing an ambitious package of funding 
and policy to help our schools reopen. 
They will lay out a reopening-related 
funding package for schools and uni-
versities north of $100 billion. That is 
more money than the House Democrats 
proposed for a similar fund. 
There will be several important poli-
cies to help childcare providers, to 
grant new flexibility to elementary and 
secondary schools, and more. 
No. 2, jobs and the economy. Two 
provisions of the CARES Act worked 
especially well to help households stay 
afloat and help as many workers as 
possible stay employed. 
As Chairman GRASSLEY will explain, 
Republicans want to send a second 
round of direct payments to American 
households, and Senator COLLINS and 
Senator RUBIO have crafted a sequel to 
their historic and incredibly successful 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program. 
It 
would give the hardest hit small busi-
nesses an opportunity to receive second 
loans if they continue to pay their 
workers. 
We also intend to continue some tem-
porary Federal supplement to unem-
ployment insurance while fixing the 
obvious craziness of paying people 
more to remain out of the workforce. 
Small business owners across the coun-
try have explained how this dynamic is 
slowing rehiring and recovery. So we 
are going to provide help but make 
sure it is suited to reopening the econ-
omy. 
But temporary relief cannot be our 
endgame. Americans do not just want 
to scrape by; they want to thrive again. 
They want a road back to the incred-
ible job market we had just a few 
months ago. So Chairman GRASSLEY 
will also lay out bold policies to 
incentivize retention, encourage the 
rehiring of laid-off Americans, and help 
businesses obtain PPE, testing, and 
supplies to protect their employees and 
entice customers. 
Think of it this way: In the spring, 
our 
economy 
needed 
life 
support. 
Today, while continuing to support 
families, we must also get the economy 
into physical therapy so it can actually 
regain its strength. 
Finally, in looking to the long term, 
the COVID–19 crisis has weakened the 
critical Federal trust funds that Amer-
icans rely on. As Senator ROMNEY will 
explain, our proposal includes a bipar-
tisan 
bill, 
cosponsored 
by 
Senate 
Democrats, to help a future Congress 
evaluate bipartisan proposals for pro-
tecting and strengthening the pro-
grams that Americans count on. 
Now, our third pillar is the most im-
portant of all—healthcare. Our entire 
reopening and recovery depend on 
knocking this awful virus onto its 
heels. 
So as Chairmen ALEXANDER, BLUNT, 
GRASSLEY, and SHELBY
will explain, 
CARES 2 will continue to treat the 
root causes of this medical crisis: more 
resources for hospitals and healthcare 
workers; more help to keep sprinting 
toward diagnostics, treatments, and 
vaccines; new policies to shield seniors 
from a spike in Medicare premiums; 
and new legislation that will leave us 
with better surge capacity to produce 
medical countermeasures right here at 
home the next time a crisis strikes. 
There is one more essential element 
that ties schools, jobs, and healthcare 
all together—legal protections to pre-
vent our historic recovery efforts from 
simply lining the pockets of trial law-
yers. 
We will preserve accountability in 
cases of actual gross negligence or in-
tentional misconduct, but we are going 
to make sure that nurses and doctors 
who fought an unknown enemy are not 
swamped by a tidal wave of mal-
practice suits. And we will make sure 
that school districts, colleges, church-
es, nonprofits, and employers that obey 
official guidance do not have to delay 
reopening because they are afraid they 
will spend 10 years in court. 
So this is where Senate Republicans 
are 
focused—more 
support 
for 
healthcare, more direct help for Amer-
ican families, and strong policies to 
help our country pivot into a safe re-
opening. We will propose to continue 
and renew some of the most successful 
CARES Act policies, while adding bold 
new ideas to help get schools and jobs 
open for the American people. This is 
the package our country needs. This is 
what we will introduce. 
We are repeating the successful strat-
egy that produced the historic, bipar-
tisan CARES Act back in March. First, 
I asked a number of Republicans to 
spearhead a serious first draft. Then we 
put those elements together and in-
vited our Democratic colleagues to the 
table. And guided by our roadmap, 
working with the administration, the 
Senate reached a bipartisan outcome. 
Earlier this week, even Speaker 
PELOSI and Leader SCHUMER seemed to 
concede that things go better when Re-
publicans lead. They themselves said 
the real work on this next bill would 
only begin after Republicans laid out 
the framework. 
Well, I am glad my Democratic 
friends see things the same way I do. I 
just hope they meet our serious, fact- 
based proposal with the productive and 
bipartisan 
spirit 
that 
got 
us 
the 
CARES Act, rather than the cynical 
partisanship that led them to block po-
lice reform just last month. 
Doctors and nurses will need Demo-
crats to come to the table. Unemployed 
Americans will need Democrats to 
come to the table. Working parents and 
school children will need Democrats to 
come to the table. 
We have known all along the Amer-
ican people would defeat this virus by 
understanding that we are all in this 
together—every single one of us. 
If we want to deliver more historic 
relief, the Senate will need to remem-
ber the very same thing. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that notwithstanding rule XXII, 
the postcloture time on the Hardy 
nomination be considered expired and 
the confirmation vote on that nomina-
tion occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, July

REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, as we fi-
nally begin negotiations on the next 
COVID bill, I note that Democrats were 
ready to come to the table with a sense 
of urgency at least 2 months ago, when 
the House passed the Heroes Act. 
Before I begin my remarks on edu-
cation today, I want to pay tribute to 
the life and work of an extraordinary 
public servant, my friend Congressman 
John Lewis. 
John was a remarkable man, whose 
deep convictions and concerted actions 
made an indelible mark on American 
history, and we could certainly spend 
hours chronicling his contributions to 
public life, from his speech at the 
March on Washington and the march 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on 
Bloody Sunday to his leadership on gun 
safety, civil rights, and voting rights 
during his time in Congress. 
John meant so much to our country, 
but he also meant a lot to each of us

who had the privilege to call him a 
friend and colleague. Almost everyone 
who served with John in his three-plus 
decades in the House has a story or two 
to tell. I certainly do. 
I fondly remember traveling with 
John to Ireland as part of a peace and 
reconciliation summit organized by the 
Faith and Politics Institute in 2014. 
During our trip, I remember how young 
Irish activists connected with John’s 
powerful work as a civil rights leader 
committed to nonviolent resistance to 
oppression and peaceful reconciliation. 
The 
following 
year, 
I 
proudly 
marched across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge with John to mark the 50th an-
niversary of Bloody Sunday. One of the 
most cherished pictures in my office is 
one of John, me, and the late Hawaii 
Congressman Mark Takai from that 
day, and we were all wearing lei flown 
in from Hawaii. 
Mark, whom we also lost too soon to 
pancreatic cancer 4 years ago, and I or-
ganized the delivery of hundreds of lei 
that day to commemorate the gift from 
Hawaii’s Rev. Abraham Akaka to Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., 50 years ago 
for the third march in Selma. News 
footage from that time showed Dr. 
King and other leaders wearing the 
white carnation lei sent by Reverend 
Akaka, the brother of the late Senator 
Dan Akaka. 
Over the years, that photo of the 
three of us in our fresh lei has always 
brought a smile to my face. 
I know many of my colleagues have 
similar stories to share, and it has been 
meaningful to hear so many people on 
both sides of the aisle recognize John’s 
life 
and 
work 
in 
statements 
and 
speeches. 
It is certainly appropriate to honor 
John with our words, but it would be 
better if we honored John through our 
actions, because while John was cer-
tainly a gifted orator, he was also a 
man of action—of ‘‘good trouble.’’ 
The best way for us to honor John’s 
extraordinary life’s work would be for 
the Senate to vote on and pass the Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, now re-
named in John’s honor. Action, not 
just words. 
CORONAVIRUS 
On education, last week we heard two 
unbelievable and frankly horrifying 
statements from the Trump adminis-
tration about its push to reopen our 
schools. 
On 
CNN’s 
‘‘State 
of 
the 
Union,’’ Secretary of Education Betsy 
DeVos claimed that ‘‘there’s nothing in 
the data that suggests that kids being 
in school is in any way dangerous.’’ 
Later in the week, White House Press 
Secretary 
Kayleigh 
McEnany 
re-
sponded to criticism of the President’s 
position on school reopenings and said: 
‘‘The science should not stand in the 
way of this.’’ 
These comments reflect a President 
and an administration’s disregard for 
the health and safety of our teachers, 
students, and families. 
The President and his enablers ac-
cuse Democrats of pushing back on his 
administration’s reckless policies for 
political reasons. The truth is, if there 
is one thing President Trump has made 
clear time and again, it is that he 
doesn’t do anything without a self- 
serving political motive. 
Come on. We all want our schools to 
open, including the teachers, parents, 
and the students I have spoken with. 
But, of course, we want schools to open 
safely, without risking exposure to the 
virus, and I really don’t understand 
why Betsy DeVos doesn’t get this. 
Reopening our schools safely in the 
midst of this pandemic would be chal-
lenging even with competent leader-
ship in the White House and the De-
partment of Education. Instead, we 
have a President and Secretary of Edu-
cation who threaten to withhold fund-
ing for schools that refuse to reopen, 
who support sweeping mandates for 
schools to reopen before it is safe to do 
so, and who push the CDC to weaken 
its guidelines on schools reopening. 
The cavalier disregard for our stu-
dents, teachers, principals, and admin-
istrative staff has produced consider-
able uncertainty in States and local 
communities already under tremen-
dous stress during this pandemic. In-
creasingly, they are forced to create 
their own guidelines, leaving students, 
teachers, parents, and principals un-
sure about how to return to school 
safely. This uncertainty is contrib-
uting to a growing anxiety across our 
country, but it is a more proximate 
concern in Hawaii, where school dis-
tricts are scheduled to reopen on Au-
gust 4—less than 2 weeks away. 
Earlier this summer, the Hawaii De-
partment of Education and the Hawaii 
State Teachers Association corrobo-
rated on a plan to provide individual 
schools a measure of freedom to decide 
how best to begin the school year. At 
the time, the low numbers of COVID 
cases provided optimism that some 
schools could reopen for at least some 
in-person instruction at the beginning 
of the school year. An evolving set of 
facts on the ground, including a rise in 
new COVID infections in our State, led 
the Hawaii State Teachers Association 
to announce its opposition to resuming 
in-person instruction on August 4. 
The Hawaii Government Employees 
Association, HGEA, and United Public 
Workers, UPW, represent school sup-
port staff. Both unions have joined 
HSTA in urging the State to delay stu-
dents returning to classrooms, citing 
‘‘lack of health strategies to mitigate 
the spread of the coronavirus on public 
school campuses.’’ Their position re-
flects the importance of relying on 
science and public health data to make 
decisions about our schools. 
If circumstances warrant, our poli-
cies should change to ensure a safe 
learning environment. As school dis-
tricts confront difficult choices with 
painful tradeoffs, our students and edu-
cators deserve certainty, resources, 
and support from the Federal Govern-
ment. 
I heard this message consistently in 
my conversations with educators and 
students in Hawaii over the last 2 
weeks during our State work period. 
Teachers are particularly concerned 
about how looming budget shortfalls in 
Hawaii could lead to a massive round 
of teacher layoffs and furloughs and 
broader cuts to education programs. 
These layoffs and furloughs would have 
devastating 
consequences 
for 
edu-
cators, their families, and the students 
they teach. 
An elementary teacher in Kona on 
Hawaii Island told me how the threat 
of furloughs and budget cuts are im-
pacting his life. He is the son of Cen-
tral American immigrants and a first- 
generation college graduate. He and his 
fiance, who is also a teacher, would 
like to buy a home and start a family, 
but they can’t proceed with their plans 
under the threat of being furloughed. 
He has been a teacher for 9 years and 
loves his job. 
Teachers are also concerned about 
being forced to return to school to 
teach without adequate childcare for 
their own school-age children, some of 
whom may be physically in classrooms 
or not. A middle school teacher in Ewa 
on Oahu had to quit her job and return 
to Maryland so her parents could care 
for her infant daughter. The school has 
been forced to fill the position with 
substitute teachers who are not cer-
tified. 
Another major concern for teachers 
is the learning loss that accelerates 
when students are not in class. 
A high school science teacher on 
Maui is worried that his students do 
not have the technology and devices 
they need to be successful in a distance 
learning model. Teachers must share 
computer carts because their school 
doesn’t have enough laptops for each 
student. He is worried about how stu-
dents will complete their assignments 
if they are learning from home 2 or 
more days a week. 
A 
teacher 
at 
my 
alma 
mater, 
Kaimuki High School, added that many 
of her students either share laptops or 
don’t have access to a laptop or tablet 
at home. 
Student government leaders I have 
spoken with have also shared their con-
cerns about learning loss and how the 
pandemic has transformed their edu-
cation. 
A recent graduate headed to college 
in Boston commented that distance 
learning was difficult for her to navi-
gate because she did not have access to 
technology growing up. She described 
the move to distance learning as ‘‘fran-
tic’’ and explained that it was ‘‘dis-
couraging’’ to continue her studies 
without 
the 
student-teacher 
inter-
actions she previously had. 
A rising senior at Moanalua High 
School in Honolulu shared how dif-
ficult it was to stay motivated through 
distance learning, especially as his 
peers stopped participating. He ac-
knowledged that he had probably expe-
rienced learning loss. 
Another senior found it harder to 
learn online because she is a visual

learner. Some of her teachers did not 
offer visual lessons, so she had to teach 
herself. She also found that less inter-
action with teachers made it more dif-
ficult for her to complete her assign-
ments. 
These stories underscore the urgency 
and immediacy of the challenges we 
face in reopening our schools. 
It is time for the Senate to step up 
and confront this crisis in American 
education. The first thing we should do 
is pass the Heroes Act—legislation our 
colleagues in the House passed over 2 
months ago. Heroes provides an addi-
tional $90 billion in an education-sta-
bilization fund, but we should go even 
further. Recently, I joined 40 of my 
Democratic colleagues to request an 
additional $175 billion for K–12 schools 
through the Elementary and Secondary 
Emergency Relief Fund. These funds 
would help schools purchase cleaning 
supplies and laptop computers and im-
plement programs to make sure we are 
meeting the social, emotional, and aca-
demic needs of our students. 
Hawaii’s 
superintendent 
estimates 
this need would cost $234 million for 
our students just in Hawaii. We have a 
statewide school system with about 
180,000 students K–12. These programs 
are especially important for our vul-
nerable students from economically 
disadvantaged backgrounds, students 
with 
disabilities, 
English 
language 
learners, and others. 
We should also pass the Child Care is 
Essential Act, which would provide $50 
billion for childcare providers who des-
perately need financial assistance to 
continue operating. How do we expect 
people to go back to work if they don’t 
have childcare options? 
This crisis in American education re-
quires a robust national effort to meet 
the needs. Instead of stepping up to 
meet this moment, we have a President 
and Education Secretary who have 
shown they do not care about our stu-
dents and our teachers. That means the 
rest of us must care—the Senate. We 
are a separate, coequal branch of gov-
ernment. We need to step up in this 
enormous vacuum of leadership by put-
ting the safety of our teachers and our 
children before the President’s polit-
ical self-interests. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

TRIBUTE TO DYLAN NICHOLSON, TREVOR MOR-
GAN, MASON
DALLMANN, A.J. SIMEON, AND 
SKYE MORGAN 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
that time of the week where I get to 
come down and talk about an Alas-
kan—this time five Alaskans—who is 
doing great things for our community, 
our State, and sometimes our country. 
It is what we call the Alaskan of the 
Week or Alaskans of the Week. This is 
one of my favorite parts of the job. I 
know the Presiding Officer loves these 
speeches too. When we had pages here, 
they really loved it. We will get them 
back here soon, hopefully. 
In all seriousness, of course, our 
country is facing very challenging 
times, and we have been tested as a na-
tion and as a State on so many levels. 
If you read the newspaper, you think 
there is nothing going right, but I will 
tell you one thing I certainly see in my 
State. I was home for 3 weeks this past 
State work period, and I noticed this. 
There is empathy, kindness, under-
standing, and people working together 
and coming together. That is the big 
story, and I think we ought to keep an 
eye on that. 
People are putting aside their own 
interests to help their neighbors, to 
help the elderly, our elders, our sen-
iors. People are partaking in conversa-
tions about the soul of our Nation— 
sometimes 
uncomfortable 
conversa-
tions but I think overall constructive, 
important conversations in trying to 
help each other, to make our commu-
nities better, stronger, and make our 
country better and stronger as we 
struggle 
through 
an 
unprecedented 
pandemic. 
I certainly see that across my State, 
and I am certain that the Presiding Of-
ficer sees that in his State, and it is 
really the best of America. It is impor-
tant to remember that. 
One of the reasons I love doing this 
‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ speech is be-
cause we get to highlight this not just 
for people in Alaska but for the coun-
try, people who are working hard for 
each other—maybe not getting the rec-
ognition they deserve but still doing 
very important work. 
This week, I am going to honor five 
very fine, young Alaskans, young he-
roes who, because of their bravery and 
instincts and courage, very well likely 
saved lives. They are our Alaskans of 
the week. But before I talk about 
them, I always give an update of what 
is going on back home. 
The weather has been glorious in 
many areas. There has been a lot of 
Sun—the midnight Sun, of course. 
There is even more Sun than in Florida 
right now at this time. The salmon are 
choking our rivers. I was out in 
Naknek, in the Crystal Bay region. 
There are huge sockeye salmon runs 
happening right now, which is great. 
There is also struggling in other 
parts of the State. Fire season is upon 
us. This is something we have every 
year. I used to be the commissioner of 
natural resources in charge of our Divi-
sion of Forestry—the brave men and 
women who fight fires in Alaska and 
all over the country, really. Sometimes 
we have really challenging fire seasons. 
Last summer was a really challenging 
one for us. Firefighters across the 
country came and helped Alaska with 
our challenges. They happened pri-
marily by lightning strikes—thousands 
in a day, you will get in Alaska. In just 
1 day, there are thousands. 
So far, the fire season in Alaska— 
knock on wood—this summer has not 
been nearly as intense as last summer, 
but our firefighters are still out there 
taking on huge fires. You don’t read 
about them in the lower 48. It is dan-
gerous work—very dangerous work. 
That brings me to the story of our 
Alaskans of the week: Dylan Nichol-
son, who is 13 years old; Trevor Morgan 
and Mason Dallmann, both 17 years 
old; A.J. Simeon, who is 19; and Skye 
Morgan, who is 18. 
On the afternoon of May 28, just 2 
months ago, these five young men from 
Aniak, AK—a village of about 500 peo-
ple that sits 300 miles west of Anchor-
age—were driving in a truck and on a 
four-wheeler in a gravel pit area a few 
miles away from the village. On their 
way back home, they passed a lake by 
the road and saw a small yellow air-
plane that was in the lake. It obviously 
had just crashed. Obviously, it had just 
crashed. Inside the plane were three 
emergency firefighters and a pilot. 
They had been on their way to the 
Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage to 
support firefighters there. This is late 
May. 
To the boys—these young men—the 
plane seemed to materialize out of thin 
air. One of them, Trevor Morgan, is 
quoted as saying: ‘‘I was like, ‘Dang 
man, that wasn’t there 30 seconds 
ago,’ ’’ and now there is a plane in the 
lake. 
When they heard the shouting com-
ing from the plane and people emerg-
ing, the young men sprung into action. 
The 13-year-old, Dylan, called his aunt, 
who works at the Alaska State Trooper 
dispatch office. Then they did some-
thing very brave. They jumped into the 
freezing water. 
Now, remember, this is May in Alas-
ka. That lake was probably frozen over 
just a couple of months earlier. They 
helped two of the passengers out 
through the mud and onto the shore. 
They loaded them into a truck and 
drove them to a nearby clinic. Two of 
the other passengers, however, were 
still stuck in the plane in the water be-
cause they were too badly injured to 
leave the plane. 
So, Mason Dallmann, 17 years old, 
waded out into the water where he 
stayed with them to make sure they 
could hang on until help arrived. Now, 
remember, this is freezing water. By 
the way, it was thick with diesel oil 
coming from the engine, so highly dan-
gerous if somehow this was going to ig-
nite. 
He was in there keeping them com-
forted for about 30 minutes. He didn’t 
leave their side. One passenger who was 
badly injured grabbed onto Mason, and 
Mason said: Don’t worry. I am not 
going to leave you. 
Eventually, 30 minutes in the freez-
ing cold water full of diesel, first re-
sponders came and helped get the men 
out of the plane and transported them 
to a clinic and a hospital. Two of them

suffered severe injuries, but, fortu-
nately, all of them are recovering, and 
they are recovering thanks to these 
five young men and boys who spotted 
the plane in the first place, which 
wasn’t a given, since it was miles away 
from town, and then they reacted and 
got them help. 
‘‘We are very fortunate,’’ said Alaska 
State Forest Director Chris Maisch, 
whom I know very well. He said: ‘‘You 
couldn’t have asked for a better emer-
gency response in this rural commu-
nity from [these] young people.’’ 
Aniak 
City 
Councilman 
David 
Mattson arrived at the crash scene 
when the rescue was going on. He calls 
the action of these young men ‘‘he-
roic.’’ Councilman Mattson said: Being 
a hero means going above and beyond 
for other people—putting others before 
themselves. And that is what those 
boys did—at such a young age. And 
such a quick reaction time. It is so in-
spiring. 
He had lived in other cities across 
the country, but he gives credit to the 
way these boys were raised in the val-
leys of Aniak. He said: 
We are a big family out here. It doesn’t 
matter what you look like, or who you are or 
what you do—you’re a fellow citizen and if 
you need help, [people in this part of Alaska 
in America] we jump in and help [others]. 
So these are just a few stellar exam-
ples of young Americans, young Alas-
kans, our next generation, who are out 
there doing their part—doing their part 
to help us during these challenging 
times. With young men and women like 
these all across our Nation and all 
across my State, we know we are going 
to continue to thrive as a country, as 
Americans, and as Alaskans, no matter 
what. We know it. 
So to Dylan, Trevor, Mason, A.J., 
Skye, and your families, thank you for 
being an inspiration to us all. Thank 
you for your courage. Thank you for 
jumping in a cold lake to save lives. 
Thank you for your heroism. Thank 
you for stepping up when your commu-
nity and people in need really needed 
you without asking any questions and 
without hesitating. Congratulations on 
being our Alaskans of the Week. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the en bloc consider-
ation of the following nominations: Ex-
ecutive Calendar Nos. 567 and 629. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomina-
tions en bloc. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nominations of Grant C. 
Jaquith, of New York, to be a Judge of 
the United States Court of Appeals for 
Veterans Claims for the term of fifteen 
years; and Scott J. Laurer, of Virginia, 
to be a Judge of the United States 
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims 
for the term of fifteen years. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nominations, en bloc. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate vote on the nominations en bloc 
with no intervening action or debate; 
that if confirmed, the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table en bloc; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Jaquith and 
Laurer nominations, en bloc? 
The nominations were confirmed en 
bloc.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
S. 3841 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that earlier today the Senate 
passed S. 3841 by unanimous consent. 
This is a commonsense measure that 
will ensure the $1,200 economic impact 
payments Congress provided to help in-
dividuals meet essential needs during 
these trying times don’t instead end up 
in the pockets of creditors and debt 
collectors. 
The CARES Act, which authorized 
the economic impact payments, sought 
to ensure that individuals in need re-
ceived 100 percent of the payment they 
are eligible for by generally exempting 
such payments from administrative 
offset for past due debts owed to Fed-
eral or State agencies. However, as cur-
rently written, this language does not 
protect these payments from bank gar-
nishment or levy by creditors or debt 
collectors. 
The bill we passed today will further 
the original intent under the CARES 
Act of ensuring that the economic im-
pact payments go to help individuals 
struggling to make ends meet as a re-
sult of government-enforced lockdowns 
and economic fallout of the current 
pandemic. It does this by extending 
protections against bank garnishment 
to economic impact payments that are 
very similar to what is provided to So-
cial Security benefits under current 
law. Moreover, it continues the policy 
under the CARES Act of providing an 
exception for child support enforce-
ment orders to ensure noncustodial 
parents who owe back child support 
fulfill their legal and moral obligations 
to their children. 
I would like to thank Senators 
BROWN, WYDEN, and SCOTT of South 
Carolina for working with me on this 
important bill. I hope that the House 
passes an identical measure as soon as 
possible so that we can get a bill to the 
President’s desk and these protections 
can be put into effect.

TRIBUTE TO MARGIE 
MONTGOMERY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
people of faith across my hometown of 
Louisville gathered recently to mark 50 
years of fighting for the unborn in the 
Bluegrass State. Together, they cele-
brated the Louisville Right to Life As-
sociation and its inspirational work for 
the most vulnerable in our society. I 
was proud to offer my congratulations 
to these champions for life. Today, I 
would like to look back to the group’s 
founding and a remarkable Kentuck-
ian’s choice to pick up the phone. 
One evening in 1970, Margie Mont-
gomery watched a troubling editorial 
on the local news. The segment argued 
for the removal of legal restrictions on 
abortions. 
To 
say 
my 
friend 
was 
shocked would be an understatement. 
She called the station to voice her 
strong opposition. Before long, Margie 
appeared on that same news program 
to deliver a genuine and heartfelt de-
fense of life. 
That broadcast was just the begin-
ning. What followed was a campaign of 
advocacy, organizing, and hard work. 
Margie spoke up, and she began a 
movement. 
Her passion ignited people of faith 
and conscience across our Common-
wealth. The Louisville group grew into 
a statewide organization, the Kentucky 
Right to Life Association. Margie 
helped create a grassroots network of 
pro-life volunteers who give voice to 
the voiceless. 
Their work is certainly making a dif-
ference. Today, the majority of Ken-
tuckians proudly stand on the side of 
life. Margie’s courageous witness led 
thousands to join her cause. 
For decades, I have had the privilege 
to work with Margie on many pro-life 
issues. I look forward to our frequent 
meetings, both in Kentucky and our 
Nation’s Capital. Along with so many 
Kentuckians, I am constantly inspired 
by her passion and drawn in by her 
compassion. The movement is lucky to 
have a steadfast and loving leader like 
Margie. 
Tragically, 
innocent 
life 
is 
still 
under threat in our Commonwealth and 
our Nation. There is more work that 
must be done so all people can enjoy 
their God-given right to life. As we 
continue fighting for those who are un-
able to fight for themselves, I am 
grateful Kentucky has Margie to cham-
pion our cause. It is an honor to join 
all those who celebrate her golden an-
niversary of advocacy, and I wish her 
many more years of celebrating the 
gift of life.

of Margie’s leadership for the sanctity 
of life. I ask unanimous consent that 
the column by former Kentucky State 
Representative 
Bob 
Heleringer 
be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Louisville Courier-Journal, July 
14, 2020] 
A DETERMINED
MARGIE
MONTGOMERY
HAS 
BEEN DEFENDING THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN 
LIFE FOR 50 YEARS 
(By Bob Heleringer) 
In 1970, a gentleman named Bob Schulman 
occasionally 
appeared 
during 
the 
late 
evening news on WHAS–TV to read on-air 
editorials (‘‘One Man’s Opinion’’). Wearing 
his trademark bow tie, he looked and spoke 
like a college professor. One night, he said it 
was time to liberalize the abortion laws in 
this country, to remove the legal restric-
tions that had made this medical procedure 
a criminal offense. 
Watching at home that evening was a 37- 
year-old wife, mother, civic volunteer, Rose-
mont College graduate and former city edi-
tor of the Irvington (New Jersey) Herald 
newspaper, Margaret Anne ‘‘Margie’’ Mont-
gomery. Alarmed, the then-president of the 
League of Catholic PTA called the station 
the next morning and was cordially invited 
by Mr. Schulman himself to give a response. 
After she gave the first of what became 
thousands of public, passionate addresses de-
fending the sanctity of all human life, her 
telephone rang for a week—some were com-
plete strangers but all agreed with Mrs. 
Montgomery that ‘‘something had to be 
done.’’ 
Right there in her kitchen, a national, 
state and local Right-to-Life movement was 
born. (The ‘‘right to Life’’ is one of the ‘‘self- 
evident’’ unalienable rights proclaimed by 
the 
Declaration 
of 
Independence.) 
This 
Thursday 
evening, 
about 
700 
socially 
distanced people will gather at the Crowne 
Plaza hotel for the 47th annual ‘‘Celebration 
of Life’’ dinner that will also honor Margie 
Montgomery’s remarkable 50 years of service 
on behalf of the greatest civil rights cause in 
our beloved country since the abolition of 
slavery. 
When the movement she began outgrew her 
house, in 1973, Mrs. Montgomery opened a 
full-time operation in St. Matthews, where 
she still today, from a tiny and cramped cor-
ner office in a nondescript office building, 
oversees the state’s lobbying efforts in 
Frankfort and Washington, D.C., runs an an-
nual statewide convention, organizes the an-
nual pro-life rallies in Frankfort and down-
town Louisville on the anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade, the pernicious Supreme Court decision 
that legalized the killing of our preborn sis-
ters and brothers, coordinates a double full- 
page ad in this newspaper on that anniver-
sary 
with 
thousands 
of 
names 
of 
Louisvillians, organizes the yearly dinner 
with a national figure giving a keynote ad-
dress, presides over the annual Walk for Life 
up and down Shelbyville Road, quarterbacks 
a political action committee that strives to 
elect pro-life candidates to public office (peo-
ple like her that will ‘‘do something’’), and 
still appears at every school and civic group 
that will have her to give one of her ‘‘talks,’’ 
the central theme of which is ‘‘abortion 
stops a beating heart.’’ 
Now into the sixth decade of her vocation, 
this soft-spoken but determined woman has 
been the Gold Star Mother who won’t let 
America ever forget the staggering human 
toll of this heretofore unknown constitu-
tional ‘‘right:’’ the 61,628,584 babies’ lives 
‘‘terminated’’ (through 2017). She is still 
Kentucky’s first responder whenever and 
wherever human life is threatened, the full- 
throated voice for those who have no voice. 
She didn’t hesitate to use that voice when 
she confronted the very man who wrote the 
infamous Roe decision: Justice Harry Black-
mun. When the University of Louisville law 
school favored Mr. Blackmun in 1983 with its 
Brandeis Medal, Mrs. Montgomery was in at-
tendance. 
When it was her turn in the receiving line, 
as he extended his hand, she asked, ‘‘How can 
you sleep at night knowing how many lives 
have been lost because of your terrible deci-
sion?’’ The associate justice of the United 
States Supreme Court audibly gasped and, as 
he withdrew his hand, Mrs. Montgomery 
quietly said, ‘‘I will pray for you.’’ 
Thanks to those efforts, and those of thou-
sands of volunteer women and men from all 
over this commonwealth, Kentucky can fair-
ly be called America’s most pro-life state 
with an overwhelmingly prolife congres-
sional delegation and state legislature. 
Elections have consequences, some good. 
Pre-natal killings in our state have declined 
from a high of 11,000 a year to ‘‘only’’ 3,000. 
Legislation Mrs. Montgomery advocated, the 
‘‘Choose Life’’ license plates, finances more 
than 50 crisis pregnancy centers in Kentucky 
that, if only a woman will assent to let her 
baby live, she will be sheltered, protected, 
nurtured and financially supported. (As of 
2017, there are 2,752 of these life-affirming 
centers throughout the country.) 
This, then, is Margie Montgomery’s most 
inspiring legacy: Her unwavering commit-
ment to preserve, protect and defend all 
human life has directly led to an untold and 
unknown number of human lives being saved 
by women in crisis who got a timely word of 
encouragement and support, looked at a leaf-
let, spotted a billboard message, read an ad 
in a church bulletin, called a crisis hotline, 
saw their unborn baby move on a sonogram 
or ultrasound and blessed God’s creation by 
giving humanity one more life to marvel at, 
appreciate, love and cherish. Those saved 
people walk among us every single day. As 
the Talmud says (paraphrasing): ‘‘(S)he who 
saves a life, saves the entire world.’’

REMEMBERING MARIA WHELAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on June 
10, we lost an extraordinary advocate 
for children and families in Illinois. 
For more than four decades, Maria 
Whelan fought to ensure equal access 
to quality and affordable childcare. 
Today, we pay tribute to her hard work 
and life. 
Maria was born on December 4, 1950, 
in East Hampton, NY. She was the 
third of 12 children. Ten cousins lived 
just down the road. Maria went to 
Clarke College and completed her mas-
ter’s at the University of Chicago. She 
supported herself working as a waitress 
and a janitor. It was in Chicago that 
she met Jack Wuest. They married and 
raised three daughters in Chicago’s 
North Side neighborhood of Rogers 
Park. 
In 1976, Maria was working with edu-
cators and advocates to help families 
when the local afterschool program’s 
sponsoring agency closed. Maria and 
some of these folks formed what would 
later become the Carole Robertson 
Center for Learning. She served as the 
center’s first executive director until 
1989. Maria helped the center become a 
thriving center for quality early child-
hood education. Maria continued her 
fight for families as the director of 
children services for the Illinois De-
partment of Human Services and then 
the senior program officer for the Chi-
cago Community Trust. In 2000, she be-
came the president and CEO for Illinois 
Action for Children, which provides 
150,000 children and families every year 
access to high-quality early care and 
education opportunities. 
Under Maria’s leadership, Illinois Ac-
tion for Children expanded its scope. 
She helped create the Healthy Food 
Program, which helps families stretch 
their dollars by reimbursing childcare 
providers for the cost of feeding chil-
dren with healthy food. Maria was in-
strumental in the development of Inno-
vation Zones that connect critically 
important resources in some of Chi-
cago’s most underserved communities. 
The Innovation Zones led to the 
transformative 
Community 
Systems 
Statewide Supports Program, which 
helps 
communities 
improve 
early 
childhood services with training, plan-
ning, and collaboration. Maria also 
helped move Illinois Action for Chil-
dren into direct early childhood serv-
ices with its early learning program 
centers in Chicago’s South and West 
suburbs. 
There was no one like Maria. Maria 
was tough, smart, passionate, and an 
authority on what needed to be done to 
best serve families in Illinois. I made it 
a point to meet with her. She made 
partnerships 
that 
mattered. 
Maria 
helped them launch the Lunch Bus 
with the Greater Chicago Food Deposi-
tory to provide free summer meals to 
children. 
Maria 
enjoyed 
reading, 
classical 
music, and spending time with her fam-
ily in Vermont. And she always loved a 
good laugh. We will miss her smile, her 
wit, and her heart. She is survived by 
her husband Jack; her three daughters, 
Catherine Mary, Ellen Rose, and Maeve 
Margaret; 
her 
three 
grandchildren, 
Teddy, Archie, and Evie; and her nine 
brothers and sisters.

REMEMBERNG JOHN ‘‘JACK’’ 
DUNFEY 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presient, the global 
community has lost one of our most 
active advocates for peace. On June 22, 
John 
Philip 
Dunfey 
passed 
away. 
Known as Jack to his many friends 
around the world, he was a World War 
II veteran, founder and CEO of Omni 
Hotels International, and the owner of 
Parker House. His impact, however, 
was far wider. Jack was an ardent sup-
porter of social justice issues through-
out his life. 
Jack lead human rights missions to 
many corners of the world, helping to 
free prisoners in Cuba, remove land-
mines in Angola and monitor the elec-
tion in South Africa won by Nelson 
Mandela. 
Jack was the founder and chairman 
of the Global Citizens Circle, fostering

cross-cultural 
and 
intergenerational 
dialogue 
about 
important 
social 
change. Together with friends on both 
sides of the aisle, Dunfey was ap-
pointed by President Ronald Reagan to 
the commission that founded the U.S. 
Institute for Peace. He was also a 
founding board member of the Amer-
ican Ireland Fund, an organization 
working to bring peace to Ireland. 
These important organizations will far 
outlive Jack, continuing his legacy and 
helping to improve lives across the 
globe. 
He lived a life true to his favorite 
saying, ‘‘We make a living by what we 
get, but we make a life by what we 
give.’’ Jack gave abundantly, and the 
world owes him a debt of gratitude. 
My thoughts are with Jack’s wife, 
Lisa, and their family during this dif-
ficult time. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
full obituary for John Philip Dunfey be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DUNFEY, JOHN PHILIP FOUNDER
AND CHAIR-
MAN, GLOBAL
CITIZENS
CIRCLE; FOUNDER 
AND
CEO, OMNI
HOTELS
INTERNATIONAL 
ALSO
OWNED
AND
RENOVATED
PARKER 
HOUSE (1968–1988) 
John Philip Dunfey, a World War II vet-
eran who dedicated much of his life to fos-
tering world peace and social justice, died at 
age 96 on June 22, 2020, in Hampton, NH. 
Known as ‘‘Jack’’ to friends, he spent dec-
ades of behind-the-scenes work in support of 
causes such as the peace process in Northern 
Ireland and human rights efforts in South 
Africa, Cuba, Central America, South Amer-
ica, and the Middle East. Notably, Dunfey 
spearheaded his family’s efforts in 1974 to 
launch Global Citizens Circle. Originally 
known as New England Circle, the not-for- 
profit entity continues its mission almost 50 
years later to ‘‘. . . gather diverse, intergen-
erational voices addressing critical issues 
and building the trust needed for sustainable 
change in ourselves, our nation, and our 
world.’’ 
Dunfey was born in Lowell, MA, on Janu-
ary 7, 1924, to former millworkers, Catherine 
A. Manning and LeRoy W. Dunfey. The fifth 
of twelve children, Jack began his work ca-
reer as did all his siblings at a very young 
age in his parents’ small luncheonette in the 
Acre section of Lowell. After graduating 
from Lowell’s Keith Academy, Jack joined 
the U.S. Air Force in 1943, attaining the rank 
of first lieutenant while serving as a B–24 
and B–29 pilot instructor. 
Following his honorable discharge in 1946, 
he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 
business at the University of New Hampshire 
in 1952. He also led his family’s business. 
From 1950 to 1988, the enterprise expanded 
from New England-area luncheonettes, clam 
stands, and pizza shops to the Dunfey Hotel 
Corporation, whose hallmark became refur-
bishing downtrodden inner-city hotels. When 
the Corporation acquired Omni Hotels Inter-
national—with 
its 
dozens 
of 
properties 
worldwide, including London and Paris— 
Jack kept the corporate headquarters rooted 
in Hampton, NH, to help preserve the close 
employee-management relationship that was 
so much a part of the early family business. 
The acquisition and restoration of the his-
toric Parker House Hotel in Boston in 1968— 
in the era of assassinations, the Vietnam 
War, and Civil Rights Movement—provided 
Jack and his siblings a prominent base to ad-
vance their beliefs in social justice. 
For many years, he led human rights mis-
sions into neglected corners of the world 
with his personal goal of releasing political 
prisoners. His favorite saying was: ‘‘We make 
a living by what we get, but we make a life 
by what we give.’’ He was kind, thoughtful 
and generous with his immediate and ex-
tended family and with the larger human 
family. The missions to Cuba, for his meet-
ings with Fidel Castro, led to the release of 
87 prisoners, the removal of landmines in An-
gola, and the freeing up of food supplies to 
enter Ethiopia. 
While a staunch Democrat, Jack was noted 
for working across party lines to achieve his 
objectives. In 1984 President Ronald Reagan, 
a staunch Republican, appointed Dunfey as 
one of the nine-member commission founders 
of the United States Institute for Peace, 
tasked with promoting conflict resolution 
and peace worldwide. Jack was also a found-
ing board member of the American Ireland 
Funds. He and his brothers, Bob and Walter, 
were recognized as bridge-builders and advo-
cates of cross-community dialogue during 
the Troubles in Northern Ireland. When John 
Hume and David Trimble were awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, they invited Jack 
and Bob to travel with them and their fami-
lies to Oslo. That same year, Jack was also 
appointed 
an 
independent, 
international 
monitor in South Africa’s historic first elec-
tion of Nelson Mandela as president. 
Jack is survived by his wife, Lisa Timpe´ 
Dunfey, Boston, MA; three children, Susan 
Dunfey, Rye, NH; David Dunfey, Sebastian, 
Florida; Stephen Dunfey, Portsmouth, NH; 
and three siblings, Eileen Dunfey Robinson, 
Bradenton, Florida; Jerry Dunfey and his 
wife, Nadine Hack, Lutry, Switzerland; Elea-
nor 
Dunfey 
and 
her 
husband, 
James 
Freiburger, Exeter, NH; and many nieces, 
nephews and cousins whom he cherished. 
Jack was preceded in death by his son, Phil-
ip; and Joan Lannan Dunfey, the mother of 
his children, as well as eight siblings: Roy, 
Paul, Kay, Mary, Bud ‘‘Bill,’’ Robert ‘‘Bob,’’ 
Richard ‘‘Dick,’’ and Walter. Because of 
COVID–19 restrictions, the family plans a 
Memorial to celebrate Jack’s life at a later 
date. 
f 
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for July 2020. This 
is my second scorekeeping report since 
I filed the deemed budget resolution for 
fiscal year 2021 on May 4, 2020, as re-
quired by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 
2019, BBA19. The report compares cur-
rent-law levels of spending and reve-
nues with the amounts agreed to in 
BBA19. In the Senate, this information 
is used to determine whether budg-
etary points of order lie against pend-
ing legislation. The Republican staff of 
the Budget Committee and the Con-
gressional Budget Office prepared this 
report pursuant to section 308(b) of the 
Congressional Budget Act. The infor-
mation included in this report is cur-
rent through July 17, 2020. 
Since I filed the last scorekeeping re-
port on June 4, 2020, three measures 
with significant enforceable budgetary 
effects have been enacted. Two of those 
measures, the Paycheck Protection 
Program Flexibility Act of 2020, P.L. 
116–142, and the Emergency Aid for Re-
turning 
Americans 
Affected 
by 
Coronavirus Act, P.L. 116–148, were des-
ignated as emergencies by Congress 
and are not subject to budgetary en-
forcement. The third measure, the 
Hong Kong Autonomy Act, P.L. 116–149, 
increased both direct spending and rev-
enues due to its imposed sanctions re-
gime. Over the fiscal year 2021–2030 pe-
riod, P.L. 116–149 would increase spend-
ing by $21 million and revenues by $28 
million for a total deficit reduction of 
$7 million. 
Budget Committee Republican staff 
prepared Tables A–G. 
Table A provides the amount by 
which each Senate authorizing com-
mittee exceeds or falls below its alloca-
tions for budget authority and outlays 
under the fiscal year 2020 and fiscal 
year 2021 deemed budget resolutions. 
This information is used for enforcing 
committee allocations pursuant to sec-
tion 302 of the CBA. Committee compli-
ance with allocation remains con-
sistent with last month’s report with 
the exception of the Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs Committee. Passage 
of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act led to 
spending in excess of that committee’s 
allowable levels over the fiscal year 
2021–2025 and fiscal year 2021–2030 peri-
ods by $4 million and $21 million, re-
spectively. Spending in this bill is 
largely due to increased receipts to the 
United States Victims of State Spon-
sored Terrorism Fund that are then 
spent without further appropriation. 
Tables B and C provide the amount 
by which the Senate Committee on Ap-
propriations is below or exceeds the 
statutory spending limits. This infor-
mation is used to determine points of 
order related to the spending caps 
found in sections 312 and 314 of the 
CBA. The tables show that the Appro-
priations Committee is compliant with 
spending limits for fiscal years 2020 and 
2021. The figures included in Table C re-
flect advanced and permanent appro-
priations that have already been en-
acted but will become available for ob-
ligation in fiscal year 2021. 
Tables D and E display figures re-
lated to limits on the use of changes in 
mandatory programs, CHlMPs, in ap-
propriations bills. These $15 billion 
limits, found in the fiscal year 2018 
budget resolution for fiscal year 2020 
and section 207 of BBA19 for fiscal year 
2021, currently show the Appropriations 
Committee in compliance. 
Tables F and G provide the amount 
of budget authority enacted for 2020 
and 2021, respectively, that have been 
designated as either for an emergency 
or for overseas contingency operations, 
OCO, pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. 
Funding that receives either of these 
designations results in cap adjustments 
to enforceable discretionary spending 
limits. There is no limit on either 
emergency or OCO spending; however, 
any Senator may challenge the des-
ignation with a point of order to strike 
the designation on the floor. 
In addition to the tables provided by 
Budget Committee Republican staff, I

July 23, 2020 
am submitting CBO tables which I will 
use to enforce budget totals approved 
by Congress. 
Because legislation can still be en-
acted that have an effect on fiscal year 
2020, CBO provided spending and rev-
enue reports for both fiscal year 2020 
and fiscal year 2021. This information 
is used to enforce aggregate spending 
levels in budget resolutions under CBA 
section 311. CBO’s estimates show that 
current levels of spending for fiscal 
year 2020 exceed amounts in last year’s 
budget resolution by $68.6 billion in 
budget authority and $55.1 billion in 
outlays—2020, Tables 1–2. Revenues are 
$114.8 billion below the revenue floor. 
As well, Social Security outlays are at 
levels assumed for 2020, while Social 
Security revenues are $16 million above 
levels assumed in budget. 
For fiscal year 2021, the current law 
levels are $1,180.0 billion and $667.8 bil-
lion in budget authority and outlays, 
respectively, below allowable levels— 
2021, Tables 1–2. This spending room 
will be spent down as regular appro-
priations bills are enacted for fiscal 
year 2021. Revenues and Social Secu-
rity levels are at the levels assumed by 
the fiscal year 2021 deemed budget for 
this budget year. Over the fiscal year 
2021–2025 and fiscal year 2021–2030 pe-
riod, revenues are $5 million and $28 
million, respectively, greater than rev-
enue levels assumed in the deemed 
budget resolution. These revenue in-
creases are due to the enactment of the 
Hong Kong Autonomy Act earlier this 
month. 
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay- 
as-you-go, PAYGO, rule (2021, Table 3). 
This rule is enforced under section 4106 
of the 2018 budget resolution. The Sen-
ate PAYGO scorecard currently shows 
an enacted deficit decrease of $1 mil-
lion over the fiscal year 2020–2025 pe-
riod and $7 million over the fiscal year 
2020–2030 period due to passage of the 
Hong Kong Autonomy Act. The budg-
etary effects of P.L. 116–142 and P.L. 
116–148 are not included in this table 
due to the emergency designations in-
cluded in the acts based on authorities 
included in section 4112 of the fiscal 
year 2018 congressional budget resolu-
tion, H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress. 
This submission also includes a table 
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 4, 2020. Since 
that filing, one point of order was 
raised. On June 15, 2020, I raised a 
PAYGO point of order against S. Amdt. 
1617, the Great American Outdoors Act, 
which CBO estimated as increasing the 
on-budget deficit by more than $17 bil-
lion over the fiscal year 2020–2030 pe-
riod. This point of order was waived by 
the Senate by a vote of 68–30. 
All years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no ojbection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2020 published in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019, by the Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not 
include those items. 
c Spending and revenue effects designated as an emergency pursuant to Section 4112 of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, do not count for certain budgetary enforcement 
purposes in the Senate. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

amounts as funding for overseas contingency operations. That provision took effect upon enactment on September 27, 2019. 
e In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, rescissions of emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 
251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

f Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first published

U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, July 23, 2020. 
Hon. MIKE ENZI, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on 
the fiscal year 2021 budget and is current 
through July 17, 2020. This report is sub-
mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as 
amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the 
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
May 4, 2020, pursuant to section 205 of the Bi-
partisan Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116– 
37). 
Since our last current level dated June 4, 
2020, the Congress has cleared and the Presi-
dent has signed the following legislation 
that has significant effects on budget au-
thority, outlays, and revenues in fiscal year 
2021: 
Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility 
Act of 2020 (Public Law 116–142); and 
Emergency Aid for Returning Americans 
Affected by Coronavirus Act (Public Law 
116–148). 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $646 million in estimated prior outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020, by the Chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on the Budget pursuant to section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not in-
clude those items. 
c Current level excludes budgetary effects designated as an emergency pursuant to section 4112 of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018. As a result, this report excludes 
$68,534 million in budget authority, $72,977 million in outlays, and all revenue effects stemming from legislation enacted before the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget published aggregate spending and revenues for fiscal 
year 2021 in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020. It also excludes the budgetary effects of other laws, enacted this session, which were designated as emergency requirements in accordance with section 4112 of H. Con. Res 71.

FY2021 NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my support for the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
which passed the Senate today with 
strong bipartisan support, and to high-
light a number of its important provi-
sions, as well as amendments that I 
have authored to support robust ship-
building and to ensure the Navy is pre-
pared for future pandemics. 
The 
NDAA 
represents 
one 
of 
Congress’s most important responsibil-
ities. For the past 59 consecutive years, 
Congress has come together in a bipar-
tisan manner to craft this annual legis-
lation. The NDAA authorizes funding 
to support our brave military members 
serving overseas, including a 3 percent 
pay raise for our troops in this year’s 
bill, and sets policy for our Nation’s 
military and critical national defense 
priorities. I commend Chairman INHOFE 
and Ranking Member REED for their 
leadership and bipartisan work on this 
important legislation, which contains 
many provisions important to Maine 
and the Nation. Let me emphasize how 
proud I am of Maine’s many contribu-
tions to our national defense. 
I am pleased that the NDAA includes 
authorization for two Arleigh-Burke 
destroyers, one of which will be built 
by the highly skilled men and women 
at Bath Iron Works. In Maine, we are 
very proud of the vital role that Bath 
Iron Works plays in contributing to 
our national security. BIW is known 
throughout the fleet for the high-qual-
ity of its ships, proving time and again 
that ‘‘Bath Built is Best Built.’’ 
To ensure we have the ships we need 
to provide for a strong national de-
fense, the bill also contains an amend-
ment I authored with Senator KING as 
my cosponsor, which would prohibit 
the Navy from reducing the current 
104-ship destroyer requirement unless 
the Secretary submits a formal certifi-
cation and report to Congress justi-
fying such a change. This process 
would require the Secretary of the 
Navy to certify that any proposed re-
ductions in the number of ships would 
not jeopardize our national security 
and that the Navy would be able to

mitigate any reduction in anti-air and 
ballistic missile defense capabilities if 
the number of DDG–51 destroyers were 
in fact reduced from current plans. My 
intention is to ensure that we continue 
to maintain a strong Navy capable of 
projecting power and maintaining pres-
ence anywhere across the globe. 
In January, when news began to leak 
that the Department’s budget request 
would dramatically reduce procure-
ment of DDG–51’s in the 5-year budget 
plan, I sent a letter to Defense Sec-
retary Esper expressing my strong ob-
jections. To date, the Navy has still 
not adequately justified such deep cuts 
in ship procurement, which would have 
devastating effects on our defense in-
dustrial base, including our private 
shipyards. This amendment and this 
bill will help to protect our ship-
building industrial base, which will be 
essential to reach the goal of a 355-ship 
Navy. 
This bill also includes important pro-
visions for the Portsmouth Naval Ship-
yard in Kittery. The NDAA authorizes 
$160 million for the first phase of fund-
ing for PNSY’s Multi-Mission Dry 
Dock No. 1 extension military con-
struction project, which will be author-
ized and funded over 3 years due to its 
large size. This project will ensure our 
Nation’s submarines stay well main-
tained and at sea for years to come. 
In addition, the NDAA contains pro-
visions I championed along with Sen-
ator SHAHEEN, which will help our 
PNSY firefighters develop alternative 
work schedules and exempt public ship-
yard workers from DOD’s government 
lodging program when it would ad-
versely affect their mission. 
In further support of both our public 
and private shipyards, the bill also in-
cludes an amendment I authored that 
directs the Navy to report on its plans 
to prevent and mitigate the impacts of 
future pandemics, including at private 
and public shipyards, by focusing on 
the health and safety of the shipyard 
workers. Amidst the current COVID–19 
pandemic, I led a number of bipartisan 
letters from the Maine delegation and 
spoke with the Secretary of the Navy 
to encourage the Department to do 
more to protect our shipyard workers’ 
health and safety. My amendment con-
tinues that effort, and I again thank 
Chairman INHOFE and Ranking Member 
REED for adopting it as part of their 
substitute amendment. 
This NDAA also makes continued in-
vestments in America’s air power, au-
thorizing 
95 
fifth-generation 
Joint 
Strike Fighter aircraft and seven CH– 
53K King Stallion helicopters. The 
workers at Pratt & Whitney’s North 
Berwick factory are proud of their con-
tributions in making the F–35’s top-of- 
line engine the best in the sky, and 
Hunting Dearborn in Fryberg has been 
making important contributions to 
both the F–35 and CH–53K programs for 
years. 
The NDAA also provides important 
authorizations for the Maine National 
Guard, including a provision ensuring 
that Maine Guard members who were 
activated to respond to the COVID–19 
pandemic 
can 
receive 
transitional 
health benefits. The Maine National 
Guard has done a phenomenal job sup-
porting our State during the health 
crisis, taking on tasks such as fit-test-
ing healthcare workers for N95 masks, 
helping the Maine CDC inventory its 
supplies and deliver PPE and ventila-
tors across the State, and setting up an 
external triage tent outside of the 
Togus VA Medical Center. 
This bill also provides authorization 
for an important perimeter security 
construction project at the Navy’s de-
tachment in Cutler, Maine, which will 
ensure the security of an important in-
stallation 
that 
allows 
Navy 
com-
manders to communicate with U.S. and 
NATO ships, planes, and submarines 
operating in the Atlantic. This project 
was the Navy’s No. 1 unfunded military 
construction priority. 
There are so many other provisions 
of this bill that I am proud to support. 
Just to identify a few, the United 
States-Israel Security Assistance Au-
thorization Act of 2020, which I cospon-
sored, was incorporated into the bill 
and would authorize important secu-
rity assistance, energy and agricul-
tural cooperation, and provide other 
authorities to support our steadfast 
ally Israel. 
Another amendment I offered which 
was incorporated into the bill would re-
quire DOD to study its military re-
quirements for negative air pressure 
room containment systems which are 
used to isolate patients with con-
tagious illnesses, necessary equipment 
I believe is essential for DOD to suc-
cessfully combat and contain future 
pandemics. 
The bill also authorizes the creation 
of a new Pacific Deterrence Initiative 
to provide increased security assist-
ance and engagement throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region in response to an 
increasingly aggressive Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
Enactment of this NDAA is vitally 
important for the security of our Na-
tion, our servicemembers and their 
families. I look forward to the Senate’s 
conference with the House and quickly 
sending the final fiscal year 2021 NDAA 
to the President’s desk.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MICHELLE COOLICAN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am 
pleased 
to 
recognize 
Michelle 
Coolican, the Flagler County Teacher 
of the Year from Buddy Taylor Middle 
School in Palm Coast, FL. 
Michelle believes the Teacher of the 
Year award goes beyond her personal 
achievement; she considers it an honor 
for the entire teaching profession. She 
credits her colleagues, the school’s ad-
ministration for its learning environ-
ment, and the students she works with 
every day for this recognition. 
Superintendent 
Jim 
Tager 
noted 
Michelle’s ability to connect with her 
students 
by 
promoting 
learning 
through community projects and class-
room experiments. She enjoys making 
her students excited to study science, 
and they have learned to expect a new 
project each time they enter her class-
room. 
Michelle has taught science for 13 
years at Buddy Taylor Middle School. 
She also serves as an adviser for the 
school’s after-school STEM club. 
I extend my best wishes to Michelle 
for receiving this award and look for-
ward to hearing of her continued good 
work in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO LEENA HALL-YOUNG 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to honor Leena Hall-Young, 
the Duval County Teacher of the Year 
at Raines High School in Jacksonville, 
FL. 
Leena is a tenth grade language arts 
teacher at Raines High School where 
she considers her role as a teacher to 
be a facilitator in releasing every 
child’s potential. Superintendent Diana 
Greene describes Leena as a vibrant 
and talented educator who has dedi-
cated her career to her students. Leena 
is credited with fostering a professional 
learning 
environment 
for 
her 
col-
leagues. Under her leadership, her 
school has seen reading proficiency 
rates increase by double digits. 
Leena is the chairwoman of the 
English language arts department and 
helps to create learning opportunities 
for her colleagues by supporting first 
year teachers. She also participates in 
Duval County’s Innovative Educator 
Program. 
I extend my best wishes and thanks 
to Leena for her passion as a teacher, 
and I look forward to learning of her 
continued good work.∑

TRIBUTE TO SAMANTHA HOWER 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
have the privilege to honor Samantha 
Hower, the Lee County Teacher of the 
Year from Mariner High School in Cape 
Coral, FL. 
Samantha is the Visual Arts Teacher 
at Mariner High School and has worked 
for 7 years in the Lee County School 
District. Under Samantha’s leadership, 
the school’s STEM Academy has be-
come the STEAM Academy, with an 
art curriculum added to science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math. She 
also began the school’s first National 
Art Honor Society and supports nearby 
elementary and middle school art pro-
grams. 
Samantha holds that an education is 
able to transform a child’s entire life. 
She urges her students to ask the ques-
tion why: Why do they like something, 
and why do they do what they do? She 
does this until they begin to ask these 
questions themselves. When this hap-
pens, Samantha knows they have found 
comfort in taking risks.

July 23, 2020 
While Samantha always wants her 
students to do their best and earn good 
grades, she strives for them to walk 
out of her classroom knowing how to 
think and respond to circumstances 
with prudence. Since opening her ad-
vanced placement classes to all stu-
dents 2 years ago, her students have 
produced the highest AP 2D studio art 
scores in the school district. Her goal 
is to prepare her students for college 
and careers through gaining experience 
and developing skills above and beyond 
their peers. 
I am pleased to recognize Samantha 
for her hard work. I extend to her my 
warmest regards, and I look forward to 
hearing of her continued success in the 
years ahead.∑

modeling, lessons and planning, and 
demonstrating 
various 
methods 
of 
teaching. He also monitors students’ 
progress from within the schools. 
Ryan believes he would not have re-
ceived this award if not for the support 
of his family and friends. He is grateful 
for the countless relationships he has 
developed in Hamilton County and 
throughout Florida. It is these rela-
tionships that have made him the 
teacher he is today. 
Ryan is also very thankful for his 
students and considers it an honor to 
be their teacher. Each day, he looks 
forward 
to 
teaching 
his 
students, 
knowing they are the next generation 
of future leaders. Ryan makes sure he 
is available to answer all of his stu-
dent’s questions, and he hopes they 
learn half as much from him as he 
learns from them.

TRIBUTE TO TRAVIS O’STEEN 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I 
am 
pleased 
to 
recognize 
Travis 
O’Steen, the Dixie County Teacher of 
the Year at Dixie County High School 
in Cross City, FL. 
Travis currently teaches U.S. history 
at Dixie County High School. Travis 
earned his bachelor’s degree in religion 
and history from William Carey Uni-
versity. After completing his world 
travels, he felt he could bring his stud-
ies and global experience as a teacher 
to his students. Previously, he taught 
finance, English, and the performing 
arts for high school students. 
Travis has always been interested in 
learning why people believe in what 
they do. This has led him to travel the 
world to research history, cultures, and 
archaeology. After returning home, he 
found that these teaching experiences 
enhanced his own classroom instruc-
tion. This enhanced knowledge has en-
abled him to help his students to better 
understand and develop a passion for 
American and world history. 
I express my sincere thanks and ap-
preciation to Travis for his devotion to 
helping his students to succeed. I look 
forward to hearing of his continued 
success in his future endeavors.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY

WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13882 OF JULY 26, 2019, WITH RE-
SPECT TO THE SITUATION IN 
MALI—PM 56 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared with respect 
to the situation in Mali in Executive 
Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond July 26, 2020. 
The situation in Mali, including re-
peated violations of ceasefire arrange-
ments made pursuant to the 2015 
Agreement on Peace and Reconcili-
ation in Mali; the expansion of ter-
rorist activities into southern and cen-
tral Mali; the intensification of drug 
trafficking and trafficking in persons, 
human rights abuses, and hostage-tak-
ing; and the intensification of attacks 
against civilians, the Malian defense 
and security forces, the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabiliza-
tion Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and 
international security presences, con-
tinues to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13882 with respect to the situation in 
Mali.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. REED: 
S. 4303. A bill to improve State short- 
term compensation programs, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, with the 
U.S. economy reeling, millions of fami-
lies struggling, and COVID–19 cases 
soaring in states around the country, 
this is exactly the wrong time to cut 
off or massively cut back unemploy-
ment insurance as Republicans are pro-
posing. 
Unemployment insurance is a finan-
cial lifeline to tens of millions of 
Americans. And it also provides a big 
boost for small businesses . . . and 
communities. Because in addition to 
helping those who’ve lost their jobs, it 
effectively injects needed spending into 
local economies. Cars don’t run with-
out fuel, and the economy won’t run 
without consumers. 
The President failed to listen to pub-
lic health experts and that hurt public 
health 
and 
the 
economy. 
He 
downplayed the pandemic, derided the 
science, and tried to force states to 
rush their re-openings. 
Now he is failing to listen to eco-
nomic experts across the spectrum who 
widely agree that four months into this 
crisis, the jobs picture is worsening. 
Experts are once again warning the 
President and Republicans now is NOT 
the time to cut off unemployment in-
surance. 
Today, more than 31 million Ameri-
cans—roughly one out of five workers— 
are collecting unemployment and thou-
sands of businesses are shutting their 
doors. More than 1.4 million workers 
filed for unemployment for the first 
time just last week. Those who pre-
dicted a quick V shaped recovery . . . 
who misled Americans that the virus 
would just disappear on its own were 
wrong. There will be no economic re-
covery until we get the virus under 
control. 
Congress needs to end the short-
sighted approach and start taking the 
long view. We need a smarter, coordi-
nated, evidence-based approach that 
recognizes reality: things are bad. Cut-
ting off UI would make them exponen-
tially worse. 
But look: Hope is not lost. We have 
the tools, the assets, the advantages to 
turn things around. There are proven, 
effective measures that we can take, 
both on the public health front and the 
economic front. Let’s focus on the eco-
nomic front: 
Economist Mark Zandi of Moody’s 
Analytics notes that unemployment 
benefits are the most effective dollar- 
for-dollar stimulus to the economy, 
with each dollar of UI translating into 
$1.61 of economic activity. Cutting off 
$600 would slash the weekly income of 
20 million households in half or more 
overnight. In a recent study, Ernie 
Tedeschi, a former economist at the 
Department of Treasury, projects that 
what will follow is a two percent de-
crease in the nation’s gross domestic 
product and 1.7 million fewer jobs by 
the end of this year. 
This is not surprising. If Senate Re-
publicans let the enhanced pandemic 
unemployment assistance expire, it 
could tank consumer spending while 
increasing business closings that will 
lead to even more unemployment. It 
could also further exacerbate this pub-
lic health crisis by forcing more Amer-
icans into desperate situations. 
That is why I, along with Senator MI-
CHAEL BENNET and Congressman DON 
BEYER, have proposed the Worker Re-
lief and Security Act. This legislation 
would take politics out of the equation 
and use ‘‘automatic stabilizers’’ based 
on actual unemployment rates to en-
sure the help goes where it is needed, 
when it is needed, and expires when it 
is no longer needed—rather than leav-
ing it up to Congress and an arbitrary 
date. 
And look, it’s not just individuals 
who are struggling. Businesses need 
help too. That is why I have backed the 
bipartisan RESTART Act and today I 
am introducing the Workforce Reten-
tion Act, which would strengthen and 
expand work sharing programs that 
many businesses are effectively using 
to keep their workers. This program is 
a win-win that offers businesses in-
creased flexibility and payroll support, 
while keeping more Americans at-
tached to their jobs. 
Right now, business owners who want 
to keep their doors open are facing the 
prospect of having to let go some per-
centage of their workforce because of 
circumstances far beyond their control. 
Businesses that are particularly de-
pendent on foot traffic, such as the 
hospitality and tourism industries, are 
only looking at re-opening later this 
year or early next year. In many cases, 
businesses are also set to lose out on 
the considerable expense and time they 
have put in to hire and train these 
workers. 
With work sharing, struggling com-
panies can reduce hours instead of 
their workforce and it helps employers 
save money on rehiring costs, while 
employees who participate in work 
sharing keep their jobs and receive a 
portion of unemployment insurance 
benefits to make up for lost wages. Es-
pecially in this pandemic, work sharing 
programs would allow businesses to re-
tain their employees, easily putting 
them back on full-time status once 
business picks up, and avoid having to 
lay them off in the first place. 
As part of the Middle Class Tax Re-
lief and Job Creation Act, Congress en-
acted legislation that I authored, the 
Layoff Prevention Act of 2012, which 
provided temporary federal financing 
for 100% of work sharing benefits paid 
to workers. According to the Depart-
ment of Labor, work sharing saved ap-
proximately 570,000 jobs in the wake of 
the Great Recession. Multiple studies 
have found that communities that 
adopted more robust work-sharing pro-
grams weathered the recession with 
lower unemployment rates. 
Mark Zandi estimates that tem-
porary financing of work share offers a 
very high ‘‘bang for the buck’’ of $1.69 
. . . making it a critical companion to 
traditional UI benefits. It’s another 
win-win policy that has been field-test-
ed and demonstrated to work well in 
more than 20 states across the country. 
Simply put, work sharing helps more 
workers, businesses, and communities 
stay afloat, and positions them for a 
stronger economic recovery. 
The Workforce Retention Act that I 
am introducing today along with Sen-
ators WHITEHOUSE, MERKLEY, and VAN 
HOLLEN, enhances the program and en-
courages states with existing work 
share laws to utilize them more fre-
quently. It incentivizes states without 
work sharing laws to stop denying 
their businesses an easy and effective 
way to retain employees. This legisla-
tion is supported by the National Em-
ployment Law Center and the Eco-
nomic Policy Institute. 
It builds off the $100 million initia-
tive included in the CARES Act, stem-
ming from my Layoff Prevention Act 
of 2020, by extending federal financing 
for states with permanent and tem-
porary work sharing programs by two 
years. It would incentivize states to 
structure their work sharing laws to 
reduce barriers to entry for companies 
. . . particularly for small businesses 
that have been hard hit by this pan-
demic. Our bill also provides much- 
needed federal grants to state unem-
ployment agencies to improve imple-
mentation and administration. 
States would also qualify under a 
new grant program for meeting certain 
enrollment incentive benchmarks and 
increasing the number of work share 
claims as a percentage of their overall 
unemployment 
insurance 
weekly 
claims. 
This is a cost-effective job preserva-
tion program and we need to invest in 
ensuring it is accessible to help more 
businesses, preserve more jobs, and 
save taxpayers billions of dollars in the 
long run. 
Our economy can’t afford more of the 
same mistakes that have deepened this 
crisis and steepened the economic 
climb back out. America controls its 
own destiny, and we have the tools and 
know-how to succeed. Other nations 
have fared much better during this cri-
sis because their elected leadership 
took COVID more seriously. They en-
couraged people to wear masks. Other 
heads of state didn’t taunt regions into 
reopening before it was safe to do so. 
And they invested in unemployment 
insurance and economic stimulus. 
Ending unemployment insurance in 
the midst of a surging pandemic could

S4475 
July 23, 2020 
make a desperate situation worse for 
individuals and harm the economy. 
Being jobless in these uncertain times 
and relying on unemployment is stress-
ful enough. If Congress cuts benefits off 
too soon and tries to prematurely push 
workers into unsafe environments, it 
will cost families, businesses, and com-
munities alike. 
It is beyond the pale that the Admin-
istration and Senate Republicans pur-
posely put off action for months. Ev-
eryone knew the virus was not going to 
disappear. It’s a perfect example of the 
Trump view of one set of rules that 
provides benefits for him, and nothing 
for everyone else. Incompetence and 
willful avoidance is not a policy, and 
it’s time for Republicans to stop draw-
ing up new ways to seem like they’re 
helping people and come to the table 
with solid ideas that actually do some-
thing meaningful. 
It is my hope that we can proceed in 
a bipartisan manner on another round 
of coronavirus legislation. This next 
relief bill must include extended and 
enhanced 
unemployment 
insurance 
benefits tied to economic and health 
conditions, and expanded work sharing, 
to keep families, businesses, and states 
solvent through this crisis. I urge my 
colleagues to join us in supporting 
these needed initiatives. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. 
BALDWIN, and Ms. SMITH): 
S. 4314. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to address the 
teacher and school leader shortage in 
early childhood, elementary, and sec-
ondary education, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4314 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Retaining 
Educators Takes Added Investment Now 
Act’’ or the ‘‘RETAIN Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to create a re-
fundable tax credit for early childhood edu-
cators, teachers, early childhood education 
program 
directors, 
school 
leaders, 
and 
school-based mental health services pro-
viders in early childhood, elementary, and 
secondary education settings that rewards 
retention based on the time spent serving 
high-need students. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The shortage of experienced, qualified 
early childhood educators and elementary 
school and secondary school teachers is a na-
tional problem that compromises the aca-
demic outcomes and long-term success of 
students. 
(2) The shortage is the result of many fac-
tors including low pay, frequent turnover in 
school leadership, poor teaching conditions, 
and inadequate teacher supports. 
(3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty 
areas where the factors contributing to the 
shortage are particularly acute and have an 
increased negative impact on teachers of 
color remaining in the field. 
(4) A child’s access to high-quality early 
childhood education is critical to supporting 
positive outcomes, and early childhood edu-
cators— 
(A) play an important role in setting the 
foundation for future learning, and 
(B) promote the development of vital 
skills, habits, and mindsets that children 
need to be successful in school and in life. 
(5) In 2015, the national median pay of 
early childhood educators was a mere $28,570, 
with many early childhood educators relying 
on government assistance programs such as 
Medicaid, the supplemental nutrition assist-
ance program established under the Food 
and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et 
seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy 
families program established under part A of 
title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
601 et seq.), and struggling to provide for 
their own families. 
(6) Studies have demonstrated that well- 
qualified, experienced teachers are the single 
most important school-based element con-
tributing to a child’s academic achievement 
and success. 
(7) In 2016, the average teacher salary in 
public elementary schools and secondary 
schools was only $58,950, which is on average 
21.4 percent less than other college graduates 
working in non-teaching fields, and with 
many 
teachers 
struggling 
with 
large 
amounts of student loan debt.

cation workforce must also be reflective of 
the diversity of the student body across race, 
ethnicity, and disability.

ers and school-based mental health service 
providers are essential for providing strong

Whereas July 2020 is ‘‘BIPOC Mental

Whereas the goals of BIPOC Mental Health 
Awareness Month (formerly known as ‘‘Mi-

are— 
(1) to recognize disparities in the incidence 
of mental health-related challenges faced by 
Black, indigenous, and people of color (re-

(2) to raise awareness of the systemic driv-

(3) to educate patients, caregivers, and the 
family members of individuals who may be 
in need of care on the importance of recog-
nizing the signs of mental illness, seeking 
evaluation and accepting diagnosis, receiv-
ing and adhering to mental health treat-
ment, and counseling; 
(4) to highlight the necessity of culturally 
informed and culturally effective mental 
health services to increase receptivity to 
treatment among communities of color and 
to reduce the social and cultural stigma as-
sociated with mental health services;

barriers to access faced by individuals who 
seek mental health care services; and

(6) to overcome and repair the mental 
harm and trauma that are experienced by 
people of color and caused by systematic rac-
ism and racial bias; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic, which has dispropor-
tionately impacted communities of color, is 
expected to have grave and potentially long- 
term mental health implications due to the 
traumatic stress associated with pandemic 
conditions, including stress from— 
(1) the loss of resources to meet immediate 
and future needs; 
(2) grief and concerns for the safety of fam-
ily and loved ones; 
(3) reduced social interaction and increased 
isolation and loneliness; 
(4) the stigma and xenophobia against 
Asian-American 
communities, 
including 
many incidents of hate during the COVID–19 
pandemic, leading to negative mental health 
outcomes; and 
(5) a lack of consideration for pre-existing 
social-environmental disparities when ad-
dressing the disproportionate impact of 
COVID–19 on communities of color; 
Whereas, even in nonpandemic times, the 
psychosocial stress of racial discrimination, 
including 
exclusion 
from 
health, 
edu-
cational, social, and economic resources, 
contributes to poorer health quality and 
higher rates of chronic health conditions for 
communities of color; 
Whereas BIPOC communities, already bur-
dened by disparities in chronic illnesses like 
lung disease, asthma, heart conditions, sick-
le cell disease, and diabetes, disproportion-
ately suffer from the mental health disorders 
that are commonly associated with those 
chronic illnesses; 
Whereas environmental strains, such as 
poverty, unsafe neighborhoods, and chronic 
racial and ethnic discrimination, among 
other social determinants of health, can sig-
nificantly increase distress and the overall 
mental and emotional well-being of poor 
youth of color; 
Whereas an emerging body of research 
shows that past trauma inflicted on racial 
and ethnic minorities has the potential to af-
fect the descendants of the survivors of that 
trauma; 
Whereas, despite the necessity of diverse 
scientific and health care workforces and 
culturally informed and culturally effective 
science and research to address mental 
health disparities, including disparities in 
care, and decades of efforts to diversify those 
workforces, there continues to be a chal-
lenging pattern of continued underrepresen-
tation of people of certain genders and racial 
and ethnic groups in those fields; 
Whereas mental health services and sup-
ports often are not aligned with the National 
Standards for Culturally and Linguistically 
Appropriate Services in Health and Health 
Care; 
Whereas the lack of linguistically appro-
priate mental health services and the lack of 
information about where to find those serv-
ices decreases the likelihood that families of 
color will seek help; 
Whereas investment in linguistically ap-
propriate mental health services will— 
(1) reverse the trend of families of color 
not seeking help; and 
(2) drive an increase in use of those serv-
ices by people of color who experience men-
tal health-related challenges; 
Whereas the Office of Minority Health of 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices has determined that Black adults are 20 
percent more likely than their White peers 
to report serious psychological distress; 
Whereas the suicide death rate for Black 
youth has risen from 2.55 per 100,000 in 2007 
to 4.82 per 100,000 in 2017; 
Whereas Black youth under the age of 13 
are twice as likely as White youth of the 
same age group to die by suicide; 
Whereas Black males ages 5 through 11 are 
more likely than their White peers to die by 
suicide; 
Whereas, in 2018, 42 percent of Black adults 
with a serious mental illness received no 
treatment, compared with 35.9 percent of the 
total adult population of the United States; 
Whereas chronic underfunding of Federal 
treaty obligations for health services for 
Tribal Nations has contributed to disparate 
mental health outcomes for American Indi-
ans and Alaska Natives, who experience 
post-traumatic stress disorder more than 
twice as often as the general population; 
Whereas, between 2000 and 2020, the suicide 
rate for American Indian and Alaska Native 
women and men has increased by 139 percent 
and 71 percent, respectively, compared with 
a 33 percent increase for the total adult pop-
ulation in the United States; 
Whereas suicide is the second leading 
cause of death for American Indian and Alas-
ka Native youth ages 10 through 24; 
Whereas the suicide rate for American In-
dian and Alaska Native youth is 2.5 times 
higher than the national average and the 
highest across all ethnic and racial groups; 
Whereas Latino adults and children face 
barriers to accessing mental health services, 
including a lack of insurance, the high cost 
of health services, low wages, poor transpor-
tation, work stress, and immigration factors; 
Whereas research shows that, in the His-
panic population, older adults and youth are 
more susceptible than other Hispanic adults 
to mental distress relating to immigration 
and acculturation; 
Whereas fewer treatment and prevention 
services reach Hispanics than other racial or 
ethnic groups in the United States due to the 
lack of professionals being equipped to sup-
port culturally specific challenges; 
Whereas, in 2017, suicide was the leading 
cause of death for Asian Americans ages 15 
through 24; 
Whereas, in 2015, Asian adults with any 
mental illness had the lowest rates of use of 
health services, prescription medication, and 
outpatient services among all racial groups; 
Whereas the rate of suicide among Asian- 
American women over the age of 65 is the 
highest of any group in that age range; 
Whereas the rate of suicide among Bhuta-
nese refugees is twice the rate of suicide for 
the general population of the United States; 
Whereas Native Hawaiian youth in Hawaii 
have significantly higher suicide rates than 
other adolescents; 
Whereas Native Hawaiians and Pacific Is-
landers face greater stigma than is faced by 
the general population of the United States 
faces in accessing mental health care; 
Whereas the first BIPOC Mental Health 
Awareness Month (then known as ‘‘Minority 
Mental Health Awareness Month’’) was des-
ignated in honor of the late Bebe Moore 
Campbell, who showed great dedication and 
commitment to moving communities— 
(1) to support mental wellness through ef-
fective treatment options; and 
(2) to increase access to mental health 
treatment and services; and 
Whereas communities of color have shown 
deep mental-health resiliency in the face of 
decades and centuries of trauma and dis-
crimination, underscoring the efficacy and 
importance of resilience-focused and cul-
turally and contextually grounded preven-
tion and early intervention strategies in 
mental health: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the 
goals and ideals of BIPOC Mental Health 
Awareness Month in July 2020, which include 
bringing attention to the mental health dis-
parities faced by communities of color in the 
United States, such as American Indians, 
Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Blacks, 
Latinos, and Native Hawaiians and other Pa-
cific Islanders.

NAVY 
SHOULD NAME THE NEXT VIR-
GINIA-CLASS 
SUBMARINE 
OF 
THE UNITED STATES NAVY THE 
‘‘USS WISCONSIN’’ 
Ms. BALDWIN (for herself and Mr. 
JOHNSON) submitted the following con-
current resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Armed Services: 
S. CON. RES. 41 
Whereas Wisconsin has a rich and histor-
ical connection to the United State Navy, 
evidenced particularly by the fact that the 
submarine fleet of the United States Navy 
produced 28 freshwater submarines for the 
World War II war effort; 
Whereas the first USS Wisconsin (BB–9) 
was an 11,565-ton Illinois-class battleship 
that was commissioned in 1901, sailed as the 
flagship of both the Pacific Squadron and 
Asiatic Fleet, and went on to sail in the 
Great White Fleet that circumnavigated the 
globe; 
Whereas the USS Wisconsin (BB–64), com-
monly known as ‘‘Big Wisky’’ and ‘‘the Last 
Battleship’’, was commissioned in 1944 and 
served in every major conflict until its de-
commissioning in 1991, including World War 
II, the Korean War, and the Persian Gulf 
War; 
Whereas the USS Wisconsin (BB–64) con-
tinues to play a vital role in educating visi-
tors to Hampton Roads, Virginia, about the 
famed history of the ship; 
Whereas individual citizens of Wisconsin 
have played a crucial role in the history of 
the United States Navy, including— 
(1) Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, who was one 
of the first aviators of the United States 
Navy and was born in Hillsboro, Wisconsin; 
and 
(2) Green Bay native Vice Admiral James 
H. Flatley, Jr., who was a key figure in the 
Battle of the Coral Sea and the Guadalcanal 
campaign; 
Whereas 63 citizens of Wisconsin have been 
recipients of a Medal of Honor, including 10 
citizens of Wisconsin who have received a 
Medal of Honor from the Department of the 
Navy; and 
Whereas there has not been a USS Wis-
consin in service for nearly 3 decades: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That the Secretary 
of the Navy should name the next Virginia- 
class submarine of the United States Navy 
the ‘‘USS Wisconsin’’.

SEC. lll. ESTABLISHMENT OF FEDERAL ADVI-
SORY COMMITTEE ON THE DEVEL-
OPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary of Com-
merce shall establish a Federal advisory 
committee to advise the Secretary on mat-
ters relating to the development of artificial 
intelligence. 
(2) DESIGNATION.—The Federal advisory 
committee established under paragraph (1) 
shall be known as the ‘‘Federal Advisory 
Committee on the Development and Imple-
mentation of Artificial Intelligence’’ (in this 
section referred to as the ‘‘Advisory Com-
mittee’’). 
(b) PURPOSES
OF
THE
ADVISORY
COM-
MITTEE.— 
(1) ADVICE.—The Advisory Committee shall 
provide advice to the Secretary on matters 
relating to the development and use of artifi-
cial general intelligence and narrow artifi-
cial intelligence, including on the following 
as they relate to artificial intelligence: 
(A) The competitiveness of the United 
States, including matters relating to the 
promotion of public and private sector in-
vestment and innovation into the develop-
ment of artificial intelligence. 
(B) Workforce, including matters relating 
to the potential for using artificial intel-
ligence for rapid retraining of workers, due 
to the possible effect of technological dis-
placement and to increase the labor force 
participation of all workers, including tradi-
tionally underrepresented populations, in-
cluding minorities, low-income populations, 
and persons with disabilities. 
(C) Education, including matters relating 
to science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics 
education 
to 
prepare 
the 
United States workforce as the needs of em-
ployers change. 
(D) Ethics training and development for in-
dividuals, including both private and govern-
ment technologists, working on and using 
artificial intelligence. 
(E) Matters relating to open sharing of 
data and the open sharing of research on ar-
tificial intelligence. 
(F) International cooperation and competi-
tiveness, including matters relating to the 
competitive international landscape for arti-
ficial intelligence-related industries. 
(G) Accountability and legal rights, includ-
ing matters relating to the responsibility for 
any violations of laws by an artificial intel-
ligence system and the compatibility of 
international regulations. 
(H) Matters relating to machine learning 
bias through core cultural and societal 
norms. 
(I) Matters relating to how artificial intel-
ligence can serve or enhance opportunities in 
rural communities. 
(J) Government efficiency, including mat-
ters relating to how to promote cost saving 
and streamline operations. 
(K) Matters relating to individual civil 
rights, including an assessment regarding 
how rights are or will be affected by the use 
of artificial intelligence technology and 
whether such uses should be subject to addi-
tional controls, oversight, or limitations. 
(L) Matters relating to urbanization and 
the development of smart cities. 
(2) STUDY.—The Advisory Committee shall 
study and assess the following: 
(A) How the term ‘‘artificial intelligence’’ 
should be defined for purposes of this section 
and how the relevant scope of the Advisory 
Committee should be defined, including how 
such definitions relate to artificial systems 
and both narrow and general forms of artifi-
cial intelligence. In carrying out this sub-
paragraph, the Advisory Committee shall 
consider the following: 
‘‘(1) The term ‘artificial intelligence’ in-
cludes the following: 
‘‘(A) Any artificial systems that perform 
tasks under varying and unpredictable cir-
cumstances, without significant human over-
sight, or that can learn from their experi-
ence and improve their performance. Such 
systems may be developed in computer soft-
ware, physical hardware, or other contexts 
not yet contemplated. They may solve tasks 
requiring human-like perception, cognition, 
planning, learning, communication, or phys-
ical action. In general, the more human-like 
the system within the context of its tasks, 
the more it can be said to use artificial intel-
ligence. 
‘‘(B) Systems that think like humans, such 
as cognitive architectures and neural net-
works. 
‘‘(C) Systems that act like humans, such as 
systems that can pass the Turing test or 
other comparable test via natural language 
processing, knowledge representation, auto-
mated reasoning, and learning. 
‘‘(D) A set of techniques, including ma-
chine learning, that seek to approximate 
some cognitive task. 
‘‘(E) Systems that act rationally, such as 
intelligent software agents and embodied ro-
bots that achieve goals via perception, plan-
ning, reasoning, learning, communicating, 
decisionmaking, and acting. 
‘‘(2) The term ‘artificial general intel-
ligence’ means a notional future artificial 
intelligence system that exhibits apparently 
intelligent behavior at least as advanced as a 
person across the range of cognitive, emo-
tional, and social behaviors. 
‘‘(3) The term ‘narrow artificial intel-
ligence’ means an artificial intelligence sys-
tem that addresses specific application areas 
such as playing strategic games, language 
translation, self-driving vehicles, and facial 
or other image recognition.’’. 
(B) How to create a climate for public and 
private sector investment and innovation in 
artificial intelligence. 
(C) The possible benefits and effects that 
the development of artificial intelligence 
may have on the economy, workforce, and 
competitiveness of the United States. 
(D) Whether and how networked, auto-
mated, artificial intelligence applications 
and robotic devices will displace or create 
jobs and how any job-related gains relating 
to artificial intelligence can be maximized. 
(E) How bias can be identified and elimi-
nated in the development of artificial intel-
ligence and in the algorithms that support 
them, including with respect to the fol-
lowing: 
(i) The selection and processing of data 
used to train artificial intelligence. 
(ii) Diversity in the development of artifi-
cial intelligence. 
(iii) The ways and places the systems are 
deployed and the potential harmful out-
comes. 
(F) Whether and how to incorporate ethical 
standards in the development and implemen-
tation of artificial intelligence. 
(G) How the Federal Government can en-
courage technological progress in implemen-
tation of artificial intelligence that benefits 
the full spectrum of social and economic 
classes. 
(H) How the privacy rights of individuals 
are or will be affected by technological inno-
vation relating to artificial intelligence. 
(I) Whether technological advancements in 
artificial intelligence have or will outpace 
the legal and regulatory regimes imple-
mented to protect consumers. 
(J) How existing laws, including those con-
cerning data access and privacy, should be 
modernized to enable the potential of artifi-
cial intelligence. 
(K) How the Federal Government utilizes 
artificial intelligence to handle large or 
complex data sets. 
(L) How ongoing dialogues and consulta-
tions with multi-stakeholder groups can 
maximize the potential of artificial intel-
ligence and further development of artificial 
intelligence technologies that can benefit ev-
eryone inclusively. 
(M) How the development of artificial in-
telligence 
can 
affect 
cost 
savings 
and 
streamline operations in various areas of 
government operations, including health 
care, cybersecurity, infrastructure, and dis-
aster recovery. 
(N) Such other matters as the Advisory 
Committee considers appropriate. 
(3) REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.— 
(A) REPORT BY ADVISORY COMMITTEE.—Not 
later than 540 days after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, the Advisory Com-
mittee shall submit to the Secretary and to 
Congress a report on the findings of the Ad-
visory Committee and such recommenda-
tions as the Advisory Committee may have 
for administrative or legislative action re-
lating to artificial intelligence. 
(B) RECOMMENDATIONS OF SECRETARY.—Not 
later than 90 days after receiving the report 
submitted under subparagraph (A), the Sec-
retary shall review the report and submit to 
Congress such recommendations as the Sec-
retary may have with respect to the matters 
contained in the report submitted under sub-
paragraph (A).

E667 
July 23, 2020 
HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, All week 
America has been in mourning—as we will be 
for so many weeks to come—as we grieve the 
passing of one of the greatest heroes of 
American history: Congressman John Lewis, 
the Conscience of the Congress. 
Thank you, Chairman HAKEEM JEFFRIES, for 
arranging this tribute to John’s beautiful life. 
John Lewis was a titan of the civil rights 
movement. His goodness, faith and bravery 
transformed our nation—from the determina-
tion with which he met discrimination at lunch 
counters and on Freedom Rides, to the cour-
age he showed as a young man facing down 
violence on Edmund Pettus Bridge, to the 
moral leadership he brought to the Congress 
for more than 30 years. 
In the halls of the Capitol, he was fearless 
in his pursuit of a more perfect union, whether 
through his Voter Empowerment Act to defend 
the ballot, his leadership on the Equality Act to 
end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, 
his work as a Senior Member of Ways & 
Means to ensure that we invest in our values 
or his commitment to health justice as he 
fought for the Affordable Care Act. 
As John declared 57 years ago during the 
March on Washington, standing in the shadow 
of the Lincoln Memorial: ‘‘Our minds, souls, 
and hearts cannot rest until freedom and jus-
tice exist for all the people’’—words that ring 
true today. 
How fitting it is that even in the last weeks 
of his battle with cancer, John summoned the 
strength to visit the peaceful protests in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
At Black Lives Matter Plaza, he stood with 
the newest generation who poured into the 
streets to take up the unfinished work of racial 
justice; helping complete the march that he 
began more than a half a century ago in 
Selma. 
His visit with the Mayor of Washington, 
D.C., painted an iconic picture of justice: an 
image that will endure, and will inspire our na-
tion for years to come. 
John Lewis believed that every person had 
a spark of divinity making them worthy of re-
spect. To honor John Lewis’s life, we must 
maintain his fight, persisting and resisting until 
the rights and dignity of all are respected. 
What a perfect tribute it would be for the 
Senate to pass voting rights legislation to 
safeguard the right to the ballot that John 
risked his life and dedicated his strength to 
defending. 
Many of us remember how John, a man of 
goodness and faith, was so moved by the visit 
of Pope Francis to Washington and by his 
Joint Address to Congress, to which he felt a 
great link. 
John later said, ‘‘Though I was reluctant to 
openly shed tears, I cried within to hear his 
words. I was deeply moved to realize I had a 
connection in some way with some of those 
he mentioned [including] Thomas Merton, a 
monk whose words I studied during non-vio-
lence training in the Civil Rights Movement.’’ 
‘‘It was amazing that the Pope mentioned 
the Selma-to-Montgomery March because dur-
ing the first attempt to March to Montgomery, 
now known as Bloody Sunday, I carried one of 
Thomas Merton’s books in my backpack.’’ 
Thomas Merton, a force for non-violence 
and peace, like John, once wrote, ‘‘We are not 
at peace with others because we are not at 
peace with ourselves, and we are not at 
peace with ourselves because we are not at 
peace with God.’’ 
But John Lewis was a heavenly man who 
was at peace—with himself, with his fellow 
man and with God. When I spoke with him the 
day before he passed, he told me that he was 
ready to go home. 
God truly blessed America with the life and 
leadership of John Lewis. 
Here in the Congress, John was revered 
and beloved on both sides of the aisle and 
both sides of the Capitol. We knew that he al-
ways worked on the side of the angels—and 
now, we are comforted to know that he is with 
them. 
May John’s goodness be an inspiration that 
moves us not to hate, but to hope; may his 
strength inspire us not to fear, but to fight for 
what is right—and to, in the face of injustice, 
make ‘‘good trouble, necessary trouble.’’ 
And may it be a comfort to John’s son, John 
Miles, his entire family, Michael Collins and his 
entire staff that so many mourn their loss and 
are praying for them at this sad time.

CONGRATULATING 
HIS 
EXCEL-
LENCY FAYC¸ AL GOUIA ON THE 
CONCLUSION OF HIS TENURE AS 
TUNISIA’S AMBASSADOR TO THE 
UNITED STATES 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as the co-chair of the Tunisia Caucus, 
a caucus I have had the pleasure of co- 
chairing with my friend, Congressman DAVID 
SCHWEIKERT of Arizona, 
As co-chairs of the Tunisia Caucus, we wish 
to extend our deepest gratitude and highest 
praise to His Excellency Fayc¸al Gouia, 
Tunisia’s Ambassador to the United States, as 
he concludes his impressive and valuable am-
bassadorship. 
The Ambassador’s career has been as im-
pressive as it has been dedicated to the peo-
ple of Tunisia—a more dedicated son to his 
mother country would be difficult to find. 
Ambassador Gouia has multiple degrees 
and has studied at the National Defense Uni-
versity in the United States as well as the Na-
tional Defense Institute in Tunis. With his im-
pressive educational credentials, Ambassador 
Gouia has represented his country the world 
over including Indonesia, the Philippines, 
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, and of 
course, the United States. 
Fortunately for the next generation of Tuni-
sian diplomats, the Ambassador has shared 
his deep and broad experience with students 
at the Diplomatic Institute for Training and 
Studies of Tunis and at the High Institute of 
Human Sciences, University of Tunis. This is 
an invaluable opportunity for these students 
and does a great service for Tunisia’s stand-
ing around the world—a standing as revered 
as it is today in large part because of Ambas-
sador Gouia’s diligent and meaningful work on 
behalf of the people of Tunisia and their gov-
ernment. 
Madam Speaker, on a personal note, the 
co-chairs have enjoyed immensely their meet-
ings and dinners with the Ambassador. His in-
sights are always enlightening as we all work 
to make stronger the solid and long-lasting 
bond between the United States and Tunisia. 
It is a friendship borne long ago that has only 
grown stronger over the years as both coun-
tries dedicate themselves to the cause of lib-
erty, justice, and democracy. 
Madam Speaker, we again thank the Am-
bassador for his counsel, integrity, and friend-
ship and wish him, his wife, and his two 
daughters, nothing but peace and prosperity 
as they embark on their latest journey.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
LISA A. BAKER 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Lisa A. Baker, Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer of Yolo County Housing on her 
retirement from the agency after 14 successful 
years. While Ms. Baker was with Yolo Hous-
ing, the agency was twice named HUD’s PHA 
of the Year, added 264 affordable partnership 
units, 104 affordable managed units, 400 
voucher units, received 23 awards from HUD, 
and nearly doubled their annual revenue. It 
has been my pleasure to work with Ms Baker 
throughout her tenure at Yolo Housing, and I 
look forward to seeing her next chapter in life.

July 23, 2020 
HONORING THE CAREER OF LIZ 
HARRISON 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Liz Harrison, on the occasion of her 
retirement from television news after 38 years 
on the air. Liz has been a familiar face and 
name with ABC 30 in the Fresno, California 
community. 
Liz, a native of Virginia, attended the Col-
lege of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Vir-
ginia, before graduating from the University of 
Florida with a degree in Broadcasting. Liz is 
married to Keith Allen, who works alongside 
her in the television news industry. 
Liz joined Fresno’s local ABC affiliate in 
1982, a time when women were underrep-
resented in the news industry. Throughout her 
career, Liz has served as co-anchor of Action 
News Live at 5 and at 11. She has covered 
nearly every type of news story and is proud 
to have given a voice to so many who’s sto-
ries needed to be told. In 2010, Liz and photo 
journalist Richard Harmelink won an Emmy 
Award for excellence in reporting for their 
story on the U.S. military training for war in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Liz’s passion for her work led her to take on 
the intern coordinator position at the station, 
where she trained and mentored college stu-
dents as they pursued a career in television 
news. She has given her time to numerous or-
ganizations, including Mighty Moms Founda-
tion, the Art of Life Cancer Foundation, and 
the Fresno Rescue Mission. 
For 38 years, Liz dedicated her career to 
telling the stories of the San Joaquin Valley. 
She has left a lasting impression on our com-
munity. Liz is dedicated to her family. She is 
the proud mom to five children and looks for-
ward to spending more time with her grand-
children. She is also a breast cancer survivor 
and a role model. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in congratulating Liz

HONORING JOSEPH DANIEL 
HEGEMAN 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize a special mem-
ber of my staff. After two and a half years of 
service, Joseph Daniel Hegeman will be leav-
ing his post in my Kansas City District Office. 
Joe took over the field operations in 14 
counties in the Great Northwest portion of my 
district in 2017. He has been an integral mem-
ber of my field team throughout that time. Joe 
was tireless in making sure the people of the 
Sixth Congressional District were treated fairly 
by federal agencies and that their concerns 
were heard by me and his colleagues in 
Washington. This is especially true as many of 
the counties Joe represented were hard hit by 
floods and agricultural crises in 2019. My staff 
and I relied on Joe to not only assist my hard-
est hit constituents, but on his background and 
knowledge of agricultural practices and farm- 
to-market programs to best form Congress’s 
response to these issues. I am honored to 
have had Joe on my staff and my constituents 
were incredibly served by his efforts. 
I have received many kind words from con-
stituents praising the outstanding service Joe 
has provided. His professionalism and dedica-
tion to this office and my constituents was a 
great example of how government should 
work. While I am losing a valuable member of 
my team, I am excited for Joe to begin the 
next chapter of his life. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in thanking Joseph Daniel Hegeman for 
his years of service to the people of the Sixth 
Congressional District. I know Joe’s col-
leagues, family and friends join with me in 
thanking him for his commitment to others and 
wishing him the best of luck in all his endeav-
ors and many years of success to come.

HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding career of 
Captain Dustin Krueger as he marks his retire-
ment from the Northville Police Department. 
Captain Krueger has worked in the North-
ville community for more than twenty-seven 
years. During his decades of service, he 
served as a DARE instructor, Taser Instructor, 
Active Shooter Instructor, Western Wayne Mo-
bile Field Force Squad Leader, and a Bicycle 
Officer. He rose through the ranks quickly by 
demonstrating strong leadership and commit-
ment to his work. He was promoted to Ser-
geant in 2001 and Captain in 2014. Captain 
Krueger received numerous honors throughout 
his career, including the 1995 and 2018 Police 
Officer of the Year Awards. 
In 2018, Captain Krueger was appointed 
Acting Chief of Police, where he provided de-
cisive leadership and stability during a time of 
transition. His unfailing dedication to the de-
partment and distinguished character were as-
sets to his fellow officers and the community. 
We, in Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, 
are so very grateful for his service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in reflecting on the remarkable career of 
Captain Dustin Krueger and his many con-
tributions to his community in Northville, Michi-
gan.

RUSSIAN CYBER ATTACKS ON 
COVID RESEARCH CENTERS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to strongly condemn the recently reported 
Russian cyberattacks on United States, United 
Kingdom and Canadian COVID–19 research 
centers. 
As the world continues to battle the COVID– 
19 pandemic, Vladimir Putin’s regime has 
once again lived up to its reputation for law-
lessness and cynicism by targeting vaccine re-
search and development organizations with 
‘‘the intention of stealing information and intel-
lectual property relating to the development 
and testing of COVID–19 vaccines,’’ as as-
sessed by U.S., British and Canadian intel-
ligence agencies. 
Sadly, neither this appalling cyberattack, nor 
the pitiful Kremlin denials which followed, are 
too surprising to those of us who watch Rus-
sia closely. 
As a Member of the U.S. Delegation to the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe—the 
OSCE PA—and Chairman of the Committee 
on Political Affairs and Security, I regularly 
participate in difficult discussions with Russian 
political leaders about Moscow’s geopolitical 
misconduct. The Kremlin’s campaign across 
the OSCE space and beyond is aimed at de-
stabilizing and undermining the international 
order by any means necessary, to include the 
invasion and occupation of OSCE participating 
States, the assassination of political oppo-
nents abroad, disinformation and more. 
On July 7, 2020, I communicated directly to 
the OSCE PA which included the presence of 
the Russian head of delegation how seriously 
the United States is taking reports of Russian 
monetary bounties to Taliban-linked insurgents 
for the killing of American and NATO soldiers 
in Afghanistan. The fact of Kremlin support to 
the Taliban had already surfaced in a hearing 
of the United States Helsinki Commission 
which I chaired on June 12, 2019, in open tes-
timony by former Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of Defense for Russia Michael Carpenter. 
Madam Speaker, I will continue to work with 
colleagues here at home and across the At-
lantic to ensure the Kremlin’s bald-faced deni-
als of its malign actions are countered, and 
that Vladimir Putin’s regime faces the appro-
priate consequences for its actions. The

HONORING 
EDWARD 
M. 
BAR-
THOLOMEW, JR. FOR HIS LIFE-
TIME OF SERVICE TO CITY OF 
GLENS FALLS, WARREN COUNTY 
AND THE ENTIRE NORTH COUN-
TRY REGION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Edward M. Bartholomew Jr. for 
his lifetime of service to the City of Glens 
Falls, Warren County and the entire North 
Country region. 
Edward Bartholomew Jr. served in many im-
portant roles over the course of his over 40- 
year long career. Elected Mayor of the City of 
Glens Falls at the age of 28, Edward set to 
work revitalizing the community, making the 
Civic Center a success, building a modern 
baseball park, improving critical infrastructure 
and establishing the Greater Glens Falls Tran-
sit System. Over the course of his two terms 
in office, from 1978 to 1985, he cemented his 
reputation as someone who can grasp all the 
aspects of a challenge and accomplish his ob-
jectives despite daunting obstacles. 
In 2010, after spending time in the State 
Senate, Ed returned to lead the Economic De-
velopment Corporation (EDC) of Warren 
County. Over the next decade, he used his 
expertise, tireless work ethic and sterling rep-
utation to accomplish many more important 
projects. As President of the EDC, he secured 
federal, state and local funding for major pub-
lic works projects and businesses throughout 
Warren County. He recently succeeded in se-
curing a $10 million Downtown Revitalization 
Initiative Grant for Glens Falls which is cur-
rently funding important redevelopment work 
on South Street. Edward had been working 
around the clock through the COVID–19 pan-
demic, helping local businesses that were suf-
fering due to the shutdown, even creating a 
new loan program for struggling small busi-
nesses. 
Ed Bartholomew was an extraordinary lead-
er for the Warren County community and be-
yond. He was tireless in his efforts focused on 
economic development and opportunity for 
every family in the region. He was a joy to 
work with and he understood the nexus of 
local, state, and federal government and how 
to deliver results for our region. He was also 
incredibly kind and will be greatly missed. I am 
honored to recognize his leadership in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on behalf of New 
York’s 21st Congressional District.

BRINGING JOBS TO SOUTH 
CAROLINA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, this month, the Midlands of South 
Carolina has been chosen as the location for 
major job creators. 
The University of South Carolina and 
Navatek, LLC have been awarded a $9.2 mil-
lion contract by the U.S. Office of Naval Re-
search for the research of power and energy 
systems and the development of digital twin 
prototypes. This is a win-win for all parties, es-
pecially the people of South Carolina. I am 
grateful that projects like these will grow our 
STEM-focused workforce, resulting in more 
career opportunities and good-paying jobs. 
I am grateful that Nephron Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation plans a new $215 million invest-
ment in Lexington County, bringing 380 new 
full-time jobs to the area by 2024. CEO Lou 
Kennedy has been a superstar for creating 
jobs and supporting the community. This is 
great news for Lexington County, and I com-
mend Nephron for creating important job op-
portunities in Lexington. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops, and 
we will never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.

HONORING MARTIN (MARTY) 
GRIFFIN, JR. 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Martin (Marty) Griffin, 
Jr. who celebrates his 100th birthday on 
Thursday, July 23, 2020. 
Born in 1920 and raised in Utah, Mr. Grif-
fin’s passion for the environment started at an 
early age when he spent time as a Boy Scout 
in West Marin and the Bolinas Lagoon. His 
passion developed as he studied botany and 
zoology at the University of California at 
Berkeley from 1938–1942. He went on to 
study medicine at Stanford University before 
opening a medical practice in Marin County, 
where he was well known for prescribing his 
patients time outdoors in nature. 
In the 1950’s, Mr. Griffin worked hard to 
successfully lead the effort to preserve Rich-
ardson Bay. And, as land acquisition chairman 
of the Marin Audubon Society for eleven 
years, he worked tirelessly to protect open 
space in Marin County and stop projects like 
a city on the east shore of Tomales Bay or a 
planned nuclear facility near Bodega Bay. In 
1962, Mr. Griffin founded Audubon Canyon 
Ranch, an environmental non-profit known for 
its instrumental work to protect landscapes in 
Marin County including the Bolinas Lagoon, 
Richardson Bay, Tomales Bay, and parts of 
what is now the Point Reyes National Sea-
shore. Audubon Canyon Ranch became a 
nonprofit educational center that has taught 
generations of people the importance of pro-
tecting and respecting our environment. 
Furthering his environmental stewardship 
footprint, in 1972 Mr. Griffin cofounded the En-
vironmental Forum of Marin, which provides 
environmental training programs for environ-
mental advocates and volunteers in Marin 
County. For 15 years starting in the 1980’s, 
Mr. Griffin also served as the Sonoma Devel-
opmental Center’s public health director where 
he led teams fighting against Hepatitis B and 
AIDS. In 1990, Mr. Griffin founded the Russian 
River Task Force, the Russian River Environ-
mental Forum, and co-founded Friends of the 
Russian River, now known as the Russian 
RiverKeepers, all of which are instrumental in 
protecting the Russian River. In 1998, Mr. 
Griffin wrote a book, Saving the Marin- 
Sonoma Coast, which was later adapted into 
a 2012 documentary called Rebels with a 
Cause, a local favorite for many environ-
mentalists to this day. 
In addition to his many personal and profes-
sional accolades, Mr. Griffin’s work has been 
recognized by many environmental groups 
such as the Environmental Education Council 
of Marin, which awarded Mr. Griffin the Envi-
ronmental Leader of Marin Award in 2007. He 
has also received the Bay Nature Award in 
2011 for his lifetime achievement as a con-
servation leader, the inaugural John Muir Leg-
acy Conservation Award from the John Muir 
Association in 2013, and the Marin Conserva-
tion league’s Peter Behr Lifetime Achievement 
Award in 2020. Further, in 2018 Mr. Griffin 
was recognized by the University of California 
at Berkeley, School of Public Health as one of 
the 75 most influential living alumni. The 
school also honored him and his loving wife 
Joyce by creating the Martin and Joyce Griffin 
Terrace Garden at the school’s new campus. 
Mr. Griffin has been an inspiration and men-
tor to me personally and to many environ-
mentalists over the years. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of those individuals and many more to 
come, I urge my colleagues to join us in ex-
pressing deep appreciation for Mr. Griffin’s 
many achievements and enduring commitment 
to protecting the environments of Marin and 
Sonoma Counties, and in wishing him a very 
happy 100th birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE 
OF MAYOR BRYAN K. BARNETT 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to rise today to recognize the out-
standing service of my dear friend and home-
town mayor, Bryan K. Barnett, as he con-
cludes his tenure as the 77th President of the 
U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
Mayor Barnett is currently serving his fourth 
elected term as Mayor of Rochester Hills, 
Michigan, where he has fostered a distin-
guished community to live, work and raise a 
family. Through his leadership, Rochester Hills 
has become a national model in public safety, 
innovation, and civic engagement. I am proud 
to be represented by such a considerate and 
dedicated public figure. 
He brought his extensive experience and 
unshakable hope with him to his role as Presi-
dent of the U.S. Conference of Mayors this 
past year, where he was responsible for lead-
ing our nation’s cities through what remains to 
be one of the greatest challenges of our life-
times: the coronavirus pandemic. In this crisis, 
and throughout the implementation of resulting 
federal directives, he has shown relentless 
dedication to securing the necessary re-
sources to keep our communities safe, and 
our businesses strong. Mayor Barnett has 
played an integral role in our pandemic re-
sponse in Michigan’s 11th District, and I am 
grateful for his steadfast partnership as we 
work toward recovery together. 
In leading the organization, Mayor Barnett 
will be remembered for his unyielding opti-
mism, commitment to bipartisan consensus, 
and belief in the unique power of local govern-
ment. As he passes the presidential baton 
onto our good friend, Louisville Mayor Greg 
Fischer, we can be confident that the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors will continue to prosper 
and deliver for our cities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in reflecting on the unparalleled service of 
Mayor Bryan K. Barnett and his far-reaching 
contributions to our country as President of 
the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF COLONEL ROBERT CAMERON, 
UNITED STATES ARMY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to congratulate Colonel 
(COL) Robert Cameron upon his retirement 
following thirty-three years of outstanding serv-
ice to the Pennsylvania Army National Guard 
and the United States Army. COL Cameron 
has sacrificed a great deal of his life to both 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and our 
Nation, and I’m privileged not only to com-
memorate his career, but to have served 
alongside him in uniform. 
Robert Cameron entered the military on July 
20, 1987, first as an enlisted Soldier and then 
as a commissioned officer in both the Armor 
branch and the Judge Advocate General 
(JAG) Corps. During his 12 years as an Armor 
officer, he served as an Executive Officer and 
Company Commander in the 28th Infantry Di-
vision—the oldest, continuously serving Divi-
sion in the Nation. In 2002, he transitioned to 
the JAG Corps, in which he culminated his 
military career. He has served in myriad and 
numerous roles, consistently executing each 
with excellence—to include Operational Law 
Attorney, Trial Counsel, Chief of Legal Assist-
ance, Defense Counsel, Brigade Judge Advo-
cate, Command Judge Advocate, Deputy Staff 
Judge Advocate, and Division Staff Judge Ad-
vocate. COL Cameron’s final duty position 
was serving as the State Judge Advocate for 
the Joint Forces Headquarters, Pennsylvania 
National Guard—the most senior legal adviser 
in the command. 
Throughout his storied and honorable ca-
reer, COL Cameron’s duty positions oversaw 
numerous missions of high priority/visibility. He 
served as the Staff Judge Advocate and sen-
ior legal adviser to the Commander during do-
mestic operations designated as National Spe-
cial Security Events, including: The World 
Meeting of Families (Pope Francis’ 2015 visit 
to Philadelphia, PA; and Military Support to Ci-
vilian Authorities for the 2016 Democratic Na-
tional Convention in Philadelphia. 
COL Cameron deployed in support of three 
different operational assignments: Operation 
Stabilization Force, Bosnia (2002–03); Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom (2008–09); and most re-
cently, Operation Spartan Shield, Kuwait 
(2018). He also served in support of numerous 
OCONUS warfighter exercises, to include Op-
erations Bright Star (Egypt), and Rochambeau 
(France). 
At various points throughout his career, 
COL Cameron solidified and redefined the 
foundation for SJA operations by re-imple-
menting staff assistance visits to units at all 
levels, and reporting requirements—allowing 
for seamless transition of incoming and out-
going personnel. While deployed in the Middle 
East in 2018, he was the first National Guard 
Judge Advocate to present at the Global Up-
date for the Worldwide CLE, in addition to en-
suring consistent legal coverage for the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait. 
COL Cameron’s impact—and his military 
legacy—is evidenced by the highly profes-
sional and competent Judge Advocates and 
Paralegals to whom he has served as mentor; 
those who will continue his legacy of profes-
sionalism and highest standard of service to 
the Soldiers of the United States Army. 
Upon his retirement, COL Cameron earned 
an honorary promotion to Brigadier General on 
the Pennsylvania National Guard Retired List. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in com-
mending Colonel Robert Cameron on his dis-
tinguished career, and selfless and tireless 
service to our Nation. I congratulate him on a 
job exceptionally well done and wish him God-
speed in his future adventures.

HONORING 
MADELYN 
MARIE 
‘‘MIDGE’’ 
PANOZZO 
SEYMOUR’S 
90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Madelyn Marie ‘‘Midge’’ Panozzo Sey-
mour on the special occasion of her 90th birth-
day. Midge has dedicated her life to her be-
loved family and the betterment of her com-
munity. 
Midge was born into a large Italian family in 
the Roseland District of Chicago’s South Side. 
From a young age, Midge learned the impor-
tance of political and social advocacy, in part 
from her father, Anthony Panozzo, a local 
ward boss. This would go on to shape the di-
rection of her life. 
While attending Stephens College, Midge 
met the love of her life, Dennis Seymour at a 
party in St. Louis, Missouri. Soon after, they 
married and would become the proud parents 
of six children. Their loving marriage and part-
nership are an example for many today. After 
66 years of marriage, they continue to lead a 
life of love and happiness in Escondido, Cali-
fornia. 
Madelyn’s greatest joy in life are her chil-
dren. Her loving and nurturing ways not only 
impacted her own children, but every child that 
entered her life. Her children proudly say that 
to call Midge ‘‘the best mother ever’’ would be 
an understatement. Every child that entered 
Midge’s life was shown the same attentive-
ness, as if they were one of her own. She 
would be a mother figure to her children’s 
friends and make sure they were well taken 
care of. Not only did Midge help young chil-
dren in different capacities, but she committed 
her life to promoting literacy. She would men-
tor young people on reading, and supported 
victims/survivor’ services across the nation. 
For the past 50 years, Dennis and Midge have 
donated to important causes that benefit chil-
dren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join me in 
celebrating Madelyn Marie ‘‘Midge’’ Panozzo 
Seymour’s 90th birthday. I wish Midge, her 
husband Dennis and their family continued 
health and happiness.

soccer tournament, bringing a focus on the 
need for organ donors in his community. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Keegan Yancey for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

HONORING AMY REISCH 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Amy Reisch who is re-
tiring from the First 5 Marin Children and Fam-
ilies Commission (First 5 Marin) after 20 years 
as its visionary executive director, culminating 
a career spanning almost 50 years of exem-
plary public service. 
Born in 1949 in Omaha, Nebraska, to Har-
old and Celia Lewis, Ms. Reisch’s passion for 
equity started at an early age when she and 
her sister Beth attended a progressive sum-
mer camp where many of the campers and 
staff were from different racial, religious, eco-
nomic, and ethnic backgrounds. After grad-
uating from high school in Philadelphia, Ms. 
Reisch obtained a degree in Sociology from 
the University of Pennsylvania, followed by a 
Master of Social Work from the City University 
of New York Hunter Graduate School of Social 
Work. She went on to apply her educational 
acumen through employment with several im-
portant organizations serving children and 
families including FOCUS on Women’s Edu-
cation and Advocacy at the University of 
Pennsylvania; Jewish Family and Children’s 
Services of San Francisco, the Peninsula, 
Marin and Sonoma Counties; YWCA of San 
Francisco, Marin, and San Mateo; Northern 
California Coalition of Civil Rights; and as a 
board member of the United Way of the Bay 
Area. 
First 5 Marin was created by Proposition 10 
in 1998 and authorized by the Mann County 
Board of Supervisors in 1999. The Act allows 
a levy on taxes from cigarettes and other to-
bacco products to be used for funding early 
childhood development programs. First 5 
Marin used this revenue to enhance early 
learning programs and experiences for school 
age children, helping them to have more suc-
cessful academic careers and equal opportuni-
ties in life. As Executive Director for First 5 
Marin, Ms. Reisch was well known for her in-
telligent, passionate and innovative approach 
to delivering services to children and families 
in Marin. During her 20 years as Executive Di-
rector, her ability to seek out diverse board 
members with different expertise and back-
grounds enabled her to build a Commission 
representing all children and families in Marin 
County, regardless of their background. 
Under her leadership, First 5 Mann funded 
programs including the CARES program to 
provide stipends to educators in early child-
hood classrooms for continuing professional 
development and training; the Children’s 
Health Initiative to provide outreach and enroll-
ment assistance for health insurance for indi-
viduals who are not eligible for public pro-
grams; the School Readiness Program that of-
fers free Kindergarten preparation for children 
who need it, and the Children’s Oral Health 
Project to provide free oral health screenings 
and dental cleanings to Marin’s preschools 
and child care facilities. 
Among her many skills and talents, Ms. 
Reisch has a knack for bringing together com-
munity leaders from the nonprofit, public, and 
private sectors to build partnerships to im-
prove services for children, youth and families. 
Her ability to create strong working partner-
ships including with the County of Mann and 
the Mann Community Foundation, and to bring 
together other influential thought leaders and 
funders most recently culminated with the for-
mation of MarmKids, an advocacy group for 
children of all ages in Marin. This work started 
in 2009, with key leaders from around the 
county who developed an ambitious and com-
prehensive vision for all children in Marin. The 
organization’s advocacy led to a community 
funding measure to establish a dedicated 
funding stream for children and youth in Marin 
County to improve children’s health and well- 
being. Although that measure was narrowly 
defeated in November 2016, the work lives on 
thanks to her enduring leadership. In estab-
lishing Marin Communications Forum, First 5 
Marin furthers public education and coalition- 
building at no cost through monthly gatherings 
with experts who share information and inspi-
ration on ways to best serve children and fam-
ilies in Marin County. 
Ms. Reisch extended her reach and many 
skills and talents to First 5’s Bay Area Re-
gional Executive Director group and the First 
5 Association of California’s executive com-
mittee. Her work has been recognized by 
many groups and organizations over the years 
including by the Marin County Office of Edu-
cation for her leadership in increasing access 
to high quality preschools in 2008, and by the 
Marin County Board of Supervisors who 
named Ms Reisch as their Children’s Health 
Initiative Champion in 2009. Further, Ms. 
Reisch and First 5 Marin received a Certificate 
of Recognition from the California State Legis-
lature for promoting programs that help chil-
dren prepare to enter school with emotional 
and social development through inclusion and 
equity. 
Ms. Reisch’s enduring commitment to out-
reach and advocacy to promote the structural 
changes needed to advance equity and de-
velop tomorrow’s healthy and well-educated 
public leaders is a gift that will keep on giving 
after she retires. Madam Speaker, please join 
me in expressing deep appreciation for Ms. 
Reisch’s career, and in wishing her much fun 
and love with her daughters and grandchildren 
and the best of luck in all her future endeav-
ors.

IN RECOGNITION OF STEVE MAD-

BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
2019 
WORLD 
DAIRY 
EXPO’S 
DAIRY-
MAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Mr. Steve Maddox, Sr. 
of RuAnn and Maddox Dairies on being 
named the 2019 World Dairy Expo’s Dairyman 
of the Year. 
Steve Maddox, a third-generation dairyman 
from Riverdale in Fresno County, knows that 
dairy farming is not just a career—it’s a way 
of life, and a life that proudly unites genera-
tions of his family. In 1957, Steve’s father 
Doug Maddox started RuAnn Dairy. That’s 
where Steve’s love for dairy farming was kin-
dled. When the family purchased a farm in 
1980, he took on new responsibilities man-
aging the new farm, Maddox Dairy. 
The family’s operations have grown tremen-
dously since 1980. Currently, Steve manages 
the 3,200 milking cows at Maddox Dairy, while 
his brother Patrick Maddox manages another 
1,100 head at the original RuAnn Dairy. 
Steve’s commitment to the industry goes be-
yond his own dairy operation. He was one of 
the initial directors of the board for California 
Dairies, Inc., and served as board secretary 
for over 10 years. He also sat on the board

and provided direction to the National Milk 
Producers Federation and was also involved 
with the creation of the producer-owned dairy 
cooperative DairyAmerica, Inc. 
Additionally, through his commitment to the 
dairy industry, the Maddox Dairy has served 
as a model for genetic innovation for dairymen 
throughout the United States. The Maddox 
Dairy began as a grade commercial herd, 
however, through genetic advancement and 
embryo transfer, the herd has transitioned to 
100 percent registered Holsteins. Both RuAnn 
and Maddox Dairies are committed to advanc-
ing genetics in the industry and today they ex-
port their dairy cattle genetics to 35 countries. 
Due to the hard work and commitment of 
local family farmers like Steve Maddox, Fres-
no County is amongst the top ag producing 
counties in the nation and the 21st Congres-
sional District is the largest dairy producing 
district in the country. 
I offer my sincerest congratulations to Mr. 
Maddox for being named the 2019 World 
Dairy Expo’s Dairyman of the Year and wish 
him continued success as he continues to pro-
vide leadership to our nation’s dairy industry.

IN MEMORY OF REVEREND DOC-
TOR CORDY TINDELL ‘‘C.T.’’ VIV-
IAN 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to an 
outstanding Man of God, iconic civil rights pio-
neer, dedicated leader, and dear friend of 
longstanding, Rev. Dr. Cordy Tindell ‘‘C.T.’’ 
Vivian. Sadly, Rev. Vivian transitioned from 
labor to reward on Friday, July 17, 2020, at 
the age of 95. He leaves in his wake many 
heavy hearts among his family, friends, com-
munity, and across the nation. A homegoing 
service celebrating his life was held Thursday, 
July 23, 2020, at Providence Missionary Bap-
tist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Cordy Tindell Vivian, or ‘‘C.T.’’ as he was 
affectionately known, was born on July 30, 
1924, in Boonville, Missouri to the late Mr. 
Robert Cordie and Ms. Euzetta Tindell Vivian. 
In 1930, his mother and grandmother moved 
to Macomb, Illinois to allow C.T. to attend non- 
segregated schools and a local college. He at-
tended Macomb High School, where he grad-
uated in 1942, before matriculating at Western 
Illinois State Teachers College (now Western 
Illinois University). At Western Illinois, he 
planned to major in English literature, but 
when he was prohibited from joining a club for 
English majors, he withdrew from school in 
protest. He then moved to Peoria, Illinois to 
work at the Carver Community Center as a 
Recreation Director. While in Peoria, he par-
ticipated in his first series of sit-in demonstra-
tions, which resulted in the successful integra-
tion of Barton’s Cafeteria in 194 7. 
While studying for the ministry at American 
Baptist Theological Seminary (now called 
American Baptist College) in Nashville, Ten-
nessee, in 1959, he met Rev. James Lawson 
and some of his ‘‘disciples’’ including Diane 
Nash, Bernard Lafayette, James Bevel, and 
John R. Lewis. He and his fellow disciples led 
a months-long, nonviolent desegregation pro-
test at public facilities that forced the city to 
change its policy. After spearheading the cam-
paign in Nashville, Rev. Vivian served as a re-
placement for an injured member of the Con-
gress of Racial Equality (C.O.R.E) on the 
Freedom Ride to Mississippi. Later, he helped 
organize Tennessee’s contingent for the 1963 
March on Washington and was invited to join 
the staff of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. By 
1965, Rev. Vivian had become the Director of 
National Affiliates for the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference (SCLC), a close ally of 
Dr. King, and a key figure in organizing non-
violent civil rights protests throughout the 
South. That same year, he led a group of pro-
testers to the steps of the Dallas County court-
house in Selma, Alabama, where he encoun-
tered Sheriff Jim Clark, who blocked the group 
and responded by knocking him down with a 
billy club in front of live cameras. Rev. Vivian, 
nonviolently, stood up and continued to preach 
and advocate for the right to vote. The footage 
from that incident and others including one in-
volving John Lewis were broadcasted on na-
tional television creating outrage and wide-
spread support for the movement and ulti-
mately resulting in the passage by Congress 
of the Voting Rights Act 1965. 
Yet, Madam Speaker, Dr. Vivian’s profound 
servant leadership did not stop there. In 1972, 
Dr. Vivian became Dean of the Chapel at 
Shaw University and National Director of the 
Seminary Without Walls. He worked with the 
Community Organization for the National 
Council of Churches, for a division of overseas 
ministries, and participated in a number of ag-
ricultural missions. He served on the United 
Nations Commission on Human Rights Edu-
cation where he organized the National Center 
for Human Rights Education. He then returned 
to lead the SCLC in 2012 as its Interim Presi-
dent helping to restore and enhance its credi-
bility. He received numerous awards, but the 
most prestigious was the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom presented by President Barack 
Obama in 2013. 
Rev. Vivian accomplished much in his life, 
but none of it would have been possible with-
out the Grace of God and the love and the 
support of his late wife, Octavia Geans Vivian; 
his children, Jo Anna, Denise, Cordy Jr. (de-
ceased), Kira, Mark, Anita, and Albert; and 
other loved ones, all of whom will miss him 
dearly. 
Rev. Vivian once said ‘‘Leadership is found 
in the action to defeat that which would defeat 
you . . . You are made by the struggles you 
choose.’’ To that end, he founded the C.T. 
Vivian Leadership Institute in 2007 with the 
sole purpose of educating visitors on the cor-
relation between the Civil Rights Movement in 
the U.S. and contemporary Human Rights 
Movements across the globe. 
Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian, and I, 
along with countless others throughout Geor-
gia and the nation salute Reverend Doctor 
C.T. Vivian for his outstanding accomplish-
ments in the ministry and his life of service 
and sacrifice for the betterment of humankind. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join us in extending our deep-
est condolences to Reverend Vivian’s family, 
friends, loved ones, and all who grieve his 
loss. We pray that they will be consoled and 
comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy 
Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JEFF 
HUCKABY 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
ORGANIC TRADE ASSOCIATION’S 
ORGANIC FARMER OF THE YEAR 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Mr. Jeff Huckaby, 
President of Grimmway Farms and Cal Or-
ganic, for being named the Organic Trade As-
sociation’s Organic Farmer of the Year. 
A fourth-generation farmer, Jeff was born 
and raised in the small town of Arvin in the 
southernmost tip of California’s Central Valley. 
He began farming at the age of 11 when he 
would wake up at the crack of dawn to help 
on his grandfather’s farm. Jeff began his ca-
reer with Grimmway in 1999 and it wasn’t long 
before he started his work with organic farm-
ing. In 2000, as farm manager, he took over 
all of Grimmway’s organic production in Cali-
fornia. Jeff would also become general man-
ager of Cal Organic Farms after its purchase 
by Grimmway in 2001. 
Under 
his 
guidance 
and 
leadership, 
Grimmway’s Cal Organic has grown to be the 
largest carrot company in the world and the 
largest organic vegetable producer in the na-
tion. Today, Cal Organic grows over 65 vege-
tables on 45,000 acres across several states 
and is proud to state that 100 percent of its 
produce is grown in the United States. 
This true American company is notable for 
their outstanding accomplishments. They are 
the largest supplier of organic vegetables to 
Whole Foods and Albertsons/Vons super-
markets, the leading supplier of organic car-
rots sold by Walmart and Kroeger and, re-
markedly, are the sole supplier for every carrot 
that Costco sells in the U.S. and many other 
countries. 
Through his work Jeff has garnered a well- 
earned reputation for his expertise in organic 
farming. Many have sought his knowledge in-
cluding the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and the House Agriculture Committee where 
he has testified about the role and importance 
of organic production in our nation. 
I am honored to congratulate Jeff on this 
well-deserved recognition of his unparalleled 
work ethic, countless achievements, and his 
outstanding role in organic farming and in the 
agriculture industry overall.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
LIEUTENANT 
GEN-
ERAL 
STEPHEN 
M. 
‘‘STEPH’’ 
TWITTY 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great leader, an ex-
ceptional officer, and a dear friend. Lieutenant 
General Stephen M. ‘‘Steph’’ Twitty, my fellow 
South Carolina State University (SCSU) alum-
nus and Omega Psi Phi fraternity brother, will 
soon retire after more than 36 years in the 
U.S. Army, and I commend him for his ex-
traordinary service to our country. 
Lt. Gen. Twitty is a native of Chesnee, 
South Carolina and his hometown has hon-
ored him by naming State Highway 11 in his 
honor. The local American Legion Post 48 
proudly displays signage proclaiming him as a 
native son. 
While growing up as a self-proclaimed 
‘‘country boy,’’ Steph fell in love with the mili-
tary. His grandfather, Spc. Carson Mackerson, 
served 11 years in the segregated U.S. Army 
Air Corps during World War II. As a child, his 
grandfather ran him through infantry maneu-
vers in the yard and inspired him to join the 
National Guard as a junior in high school. 
He matriculated at SCSU and joined the Re-
served Officers Training Corps (ROTC) pro-
gram, which had about 600 cadets at that 
time. Lt. Gen. Twitty graduated among the top 
of his ROTC class in 1985, and having a 
choice of any assignment, he chose to follow 
in his grandfather’s footsteps and become an 
Army infantryman. 
He is part of a proud tradition at SCSU 
which boasts of 22 ROTC graduates who 
have attained the rank of general officer. Lt. 
Gen. Twitty is a shining example of a dedica-
tion to excellence and leadership that SCSU’s 
ROTC program instills in its cadets. He was 
named a Distinguished Alumnus in 2004 and 
inducted into the SCSU ROTC Hall of Fame in 
2009. He has given back by establishing a 
program in which senior Army officers provide 
mentorships and leadership development to 
ROTC cadets at SCSU. 
Lt. Gen. Twitty has earned a master’s de-
gree in Public Administration from Central 
Michigan University and a master’s in National 
Security Strategy from the National Defense 
University. He has served five combat tours in 
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. His service has 
taken him to 174 countries and every con-
tinent except Antarctica, and he has held 
some of the most critical positions in defense 
of our nation. 
After his first assignment with the 101st Air-
borne Division at Ft. Campbell, he deployed 
with the 24 Infantry Division during Operation 
Desert Storm. He has commanded infantry 
units at the company, battalion, and brigade 
levels. Lt. Gen. Twitty’s assignments as a gen-
eral officer include deputy commander and 
commander of the 1st Armored Division, Dep-
uty Chief of Staff of the International Security 
Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and com-
mander of the First United States Army. 
For the past two years, Lt. Gen. Twitty has 
been the deputy commander of United States 
European Command in Stuttgart, Germany. 
During this period of extraordinary change and 
challenge in Europe’s security environment. 
He improved relationships with NATO allies 
and European partners and through his stra-
tegic vision, Lt. Gen. Twitty successfully led 
his command through some of the most com-
plex national security issues facing the United 
States. The foundations he established will 
allow NATO and our Armed Forces to meet 
every mission requirement in Europe. Accord-
ing to Forces Command Commanding General 
Robert Abrams, ‘‘Lt. Gen. Twitty has provided 
outstanding leadership, advice, and sound 
professional judgment.’’ 
His numerous awards and decorations in-
clude the Silver Star Medal, the nation’s third 
highest award for valor. He received the honor 
for his extraordinary combat leadership of the 
3rd Infantry Division’s 3rd Battalion 15th Infan-
try Regiment during the initial assault on 
Baghdad, Iraq in 2003. He was inducted in the 
U.S. Army ROTC Hall of Fame in 2018. 
Lt. Gen. Twitty is married to the former 
Karen Wilson. They have two daughters, Ash-
ley and Brooke. The family has served along-
side him throughout his career, and their serv-
ice is appreciated as well. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in thanking Lt. Gen. Twitty 
for his commitment to service, sacrifices for, 
and contribution to this great nation and wish-
es of success in his future endeavors.
