May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory.

f 
HONORING THE CAREER OF JANE 
GOFF 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the career of Jane 
Goff, a lifelong educator who will be re-
tiring from the Colorado State Board 
of Education after 12 years as a rep-
resentative from the Seventh Congres-
sional District. Jane’s dedication to 
education for Colorado made a signifi-
cant impact, which will last for years 
to come. 
A native of Colorado, Jane graduated 
from Jefferson County Public Schools, 
where she would later spend 34 years as 
a French and Spanish teacher. She 
served on the Jeffco PTA Board of Di-
rectors and is president of the Jeffer-
son County Education Association. 
After the Columbine High School 
tragedy, Jane was frequently consulted 
on school safety and crisis response, 
providing a teacher’s perspective to a 
variety of local, State, and national 
audiences. 
After 
retirement 
from 
Jefferson 
County Public Schools, Jane was elect-
ed to the Colorado State Board of Edu-
cation in 2008 and reelected in 2014. She 
served as a member of the National As-
sociation of State Boards of Education 
for 3 years before being elected presi-
dent of that association in 2014. 
Jane has worked side-by-side with 
students, educators, and me to help im-
prove outcomes for students and our 
entire community. She leaves a lasting 
legacy for Colorado students, and she 
will be dearly missed on the Colorado 
State Board of Education. 
Jane, thank you for your friendship, 
your partnership, and your service to 
public education and to the State of 
Colorado.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5644 
October 2, 2020 
CONGRATULATING MAYOR JOHN 
KONIAR 
(Mr. BYRNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Mayor John 
Koniar of Foley on his upcoming re-
tirement after a remarkable career in 
public service. 
Mayor Koniar began his official serv-
ice to the people of Foley upon his 
election to the city council in 1980. He 
began serving as mayor pro tem in 1996 
until his appointment to mayor in 2006. 
The people of Foley have shown their 
continued trust to Mayor Koniar by re-
electing him in 2008, 2012, and 2016. 
Mayor Koniar has been absolutely in-
dispensable in the promotion of Foley 
and its remarkable growth over the 
past several decades. Despite that 
growth, 
Foley 
has 
maintained 
its 
small-town Alabama charm, so exem-
plified by Mayor Koniar himself. 
He leaves big shoes to fill, but in no 
small part due to his leadership, Foley 
is positioned better than ever. 
It has been a pleasure to work with 
Mayor Koniar during my time in Con-
gress, and I wish him and his family all 
the best as they embark on this new 
stage in their lives together. 
f 
CONGRESS PASSED 600 PIECES OF 
LEGISLATION 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this 
has been one of the most productive 
sessions of the U.S. House in modern 
history. 
In less than 2 years, under Demo-
cratic leadership, the House has passed 
more than 600 pieces of legislation re-
sponding to the urgent priorities of the 
American people. 
We have passed bills for the people, 
cracking down on corruption, driving 
down healthcare costs, and raising 
wages for workers. 
Many of these bills are bipartisan. 
All are commonsense approaches for 
delivering results for working people. 
But roughly 400 of these bills have 
been buried in MITCH MCCONNELL’s leg-
islative graveyard. He won’t even give 
them a vote. His sole purpose, it seems, 
is to pack the Federal judiciary with 
rightwing judges who will rip away 
healthcare from 20 million people and 
eliminate protections for people with 
preexisting conditions. 
This is no way to run a democracy. 
The American people deserve better. 
That is why House Democrats will keep 
fighting for the people until these bills 
become law. 
f 
RECOGNIZING GERMAN-AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Ger-
man-American Caucus, I rise today to 
recognize October as German-American 
Heritage Month and to commemorate 
30 years of German unity. 
Last year, I introduced H. Res. 446, a 
bipartisan resolution to recognize the 
importance of the alliance between the 
United States and Germany and to 
highlight our shared commitment to 
democracy. 
The resolution reaffirms our support 
of the Wunderbar Together initiative, 
which, in 2019, worked with 500 part-
ners to host more than 2,800 events to 
celebrate German-American culture, 
art, science, and more. 
On October 3, 1990, East and West 
Germany reunited, just short of 1 year 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when 
thousands rushed to Brandenburg Gate 
to celebrate. 
This year, the German Ambassador 
to the United States, Emily Haber, is 
hosting a virtual event to celebrate 
East and West Germany becoming one, 
walking attendees through the mile-
stones that led to this historic mo-
ment. Anyone can tune in by visiting 
the Embassy’s Facebook page tomor-
row at 1 p.m. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say 
danke, or thank you, to our German 
friends, and prost, or cheers, as we cel-
ebrate this milestone together. 
f 
AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED RELIEF 
NOW 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I recently re-
ceived a letter from a constituent 
named Jeffrey. Jeffrey was laid off in 
March and hasn’t been able to find 
work during the pandemic. 
He wrote to me and said: ‘‘I have 
been scraping by on my savings and 
borrowing, and I am now finally broke 
with a disabled brother, a 13-year-old 
kid to feed, and a house.’’ 
Another constituent wrote about his 
83-year-old mother, who survives on a 
small pension and Social Security. The 
pandemic has required her to have a 
caregiver for much longer hours. Her 
and sons’ bank accounts are running 
dry. 
The American people need relief now, 
which is why the House passed the up-
dated Heroes Act this week with an-
other round of stimulus checks; ex-
tended unemployment benefits; small 
business support; and money for local, 
State, and Tribal governments to pay 
for essential services like first respond-
ers, police, firefighters, and teachers. 
The House is doing their job. The 
Senate must do theirs and bring this 
bill for a vote for the people. 
f 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
TIMOTHY EBERT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of a Good Samaritan and hero 
from Georgia’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, Mr. Timothy Ebert of Richmond 
Hill. 
On August 9, Timothy Ebert was on 
his way to work at the Savannah-Hil-
ton Head International Airport when 
he got out to help a motorist near the 
intersection of I–95 and I–16. When he 
tried to help another driver, he was, 
sadly, hit by another car and killed on 
the interstate. 
Mr. Ebert was one of the kindest, 
most selfless people. His life was 
marked by the way he served others. 
He was an E–7 Marine veteran who 
served his country, friends, family, and 
even complete strangers with his ut-
most abilities. 
Timothy loved to spend time explor-
ing the outdoors and playing games 
with his family. His two sons, Bryce 
and Braden; his daughter, Tinley; and 
his lovely wife, Lindsay, were his whole 
world. 
It is people like Timothy who make 
our world a better place and inspire us 
to be the best people we can be. He will 
always be remembered for his selfless-
ness and kindness, and I know his leg-
acy will continue. 
His friends, family, and all who knew 
him will continue to be in my thoughts 
and prayers. 
f 
CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
COMMERCIAL RADIO 
(Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the 
Congressional Broadcasters Caucus and 
a former radio sports announcer, I 
would like to acknowledge and cele-
brate that this year is the 100th anni-
versary of the first commercial radio 
broadcast. 
In fact, it was in my home State of 
Pennsylvania that station KDKA made 
the first commercial broadcast. This 
revolutionary idea brought news to 
people before they had to read about it 
in the newspaper. 
For a century now, radio broadcasts 
have crossed towns, cities, and States 
across our Nation to bring us the sense 
of kinship we have come to expect from 
stations that are invested in our com-
munities. 
We are looking forward to the next 
100 years of radio entertaining, con-
necting, and informing Americans. 
f 
IT IS TIME TO BAN ASBESTOS 
(Mr. WALDEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, it does 
not give me pleasure to be here today 
to say what I am about to say. I am 
really frustrated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5645 
October 2, 2020 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, which I am the ranking mem-
ber and former chairman of, we worked 
most of this year on legislation to ban 
the manufacture, processing, and dis-
tribution of asbestos. 
We 
found 
common 
ground. 
We 
worked together. We voted it out of 
committee by a 47–1 vote. We fully an-
ticipated the work product of the Re-
publicans and Democrats in that com-
mittee to be brought to the floor under 
suspension, as approved by the com-
mittee. 
Sadly, Democrats on Friday night 
listed the bill, but they had rewritten 
parts of it without ever consulting 
with Republicans and tried to cram it 
through the process. 
Now, after many days of trying to 
work this out between us, and we have 
offered many alternatives to try and 
accommodate our majority colleagues, 
they are trying to blame Republicans 
for this bill not coming to the floor. 
Well, I will tell you what, bring the 
bill we passed out of committee to the 
floor and we will vote for it, and it will 
pass overwhelmingly. 
You are the majority party. You just 
brought a $2.2 trillion bill to the floor; 
you can bring this one under a rule. Do 
that. Keep your word. 
Let’s work together and ban asbes-
tos. 
f 
FINDING A PATH FORWARD TO 
BAN ASBESTOS 
(Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, since 
last Friday, I have been working in 
good faith to find a path forward on a 
bill to ban asbestos. Democrats ended 
that effort yesterday evening. 
The bill passed the Energy and Com-
merce Committee with bipartisan sup-
port last November, but the majority 
added new language just last Friday. 
One minute is not enough to detail 
my concerns with that language or to 
describe every offer our side made to 
try to reach agreement. The committee 
record will have to speak for itself. 
The record shows the bill passed 47–1. 
Every Democrat on the committee 
voted for it. It shows the bill does not 
affect talc litigation. And it shows ex-
actly which special interest objected, 
trial lawyers who didn’t get exactly 
what they wanted. 
I want to offer my apologies to Linda 
Reinstein, who has been a tireless ad-
vocate for more than a decade and has 
fought the good fight in honor of her 
late husband, Alan, for whom this bill 
is named. 
We know the 47–1 bill I have right 
here could pass. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 1603, 
ALAIN REINSTEIN BAN ASBES-
TOS NOW ACT OF 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce and 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of H.R. 1603, and I ask for its im-
mediate consideration in the House 
with an amendment adopted by the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce 
on November 19, 2019, by a vote of 47 
yeas and 1 nay. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships.

CONDEMNING UNWANTED, UNNEC-
ESSARY MEDICAL PROCEDURES 
ON 
INDIVIDUALS 
WITHOUT 
THEIR 
FULL, 
INFORMED 
CON-
SENT 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1164, I call up 
the resolution (H. Res. 1153) con-
demning unwanted, unnecessary med-
ical procedures on individuals without 
their full, informed consent, and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1164, the 
amendment to the resolution, printed 
in House Report 116–557, is adopted and 
the resolution, as amended, is consid-
ered read. 
The text of the resolution, as amend-
ed, is as follows: 
H. RES. 1153 
Whereas there is a shameful history in the 
United States of Black, Indigenous, people of 
color, immigrants, poor people, and people 
with disabilities being subjected to medical 
procedures without their informed consent; 
Whereas 32 States passed eugenic-steriliza-
tion laws, resulting in the sterilization of be-
tween 60,000 to 70,000 people beginning in the 
early 1900s; 
Whereas 25 percent of Native American 
women of childbearing age were sterilized 
over the course of 6 years after the passage 
of the Family Planning Services and Popu-
lation Research Act of 1970; 
Whereas incarcerated individuals have con-
tinued to face sterilization practices, includ-
ing nearly 150 incarcerated women in Cali-
fornia prisons sterilized between 2006 and 
2010; 
Whereas, on September 14, 2020, a coalition 
of organizations, including Project South, 
Georgia Detention Watch, Georgia Latino 
Alliance for Human Rights, and South Geor-
gia Immigrant Support Network, filed a 
complaint to the Department of Homeland 
Security Office of Inspector General express-
ing concerns about the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center in Ocilla, Georgia, including de-
tained immigrant women receiving unneces-
sary hysterectomies and a lack of informed 
consent for gynecological procedures; 
Whereas a growing number of women are 
coming forward to share stories of unwanted, 
unnecessary medical procedures, including 
full or partial hysterectomies and other pro-
cedures involving their reproductive organs, 
performed without their knowledge or con-
sent; 
Whereas, on September 16, 2020, U.S. Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement nearly de-
ported a woman who was formerly detained 
at Irwin County Detention Center who had 
one fallopian tube removed without her 
knowledge or consent; 
Whereas, on September 18, 2020, 4 women 
came forward saying that they did not ap-
prove of the procedures they received; 
Whereas an initial review of available med-
ical records by independent gynecologists 
raises serious questions about whether pa-
tients detained at the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center provided informed consent and 
whether prevailing standards of care were 
adhered to in their care; and 
Whereas these allegations indicate a fail-
ure by U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement to conduct rigorous oversight to 
protect the health and safety of people in its 
custody: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns performing unwanted, unnec-
essary medical procedures on individuals 
without their full, informed consent; 
(2) recognizes that everyone deserves to 
control their own reproductive choices and 
make informed choices about their bodies; 
(3) recognizes that further accountability, 
oversight, and transparency is necessary to 
protect people in the custody of U.S. Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement; and 
(4) calls on the Department of Homeland 
Security to— 
(A) pause the removal of any individual 
who experienced any medical procedure at 
the Irwin County Detention Center; 
(B) allow individuals who may have experi-
enced an unnecessary or nonconsensual pro-
cedure to have immediate access to ade-
quate, safe, and consensual medical treat-
ment or to seek a second opinion from an 
independent medical professional; 
(C) immediately comply with all investiga-
tions and records requests related to inves-
tigations about the Irwin County Detention 
Center; 
(D) ensure impacted individuals are able to 
freely participate in any investigation and 
share their stories without fear of reprisal; 
and 
(E) hold all individuals found to be in-
volved in any unnecessary or nonconsensual 
medical procedure at the Irwin County De-
tention Center accountable and bring them 
to justice. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution, as amended, shall be debatable 
for 1 hour, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
The gentlewoman from Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL) and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H. Res. 
1154. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, imagine this: You are 
an immigrant woman detained in a de-
tention center. Perhaps you have been

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5646 
October 2, 2020 
asking for help for months about a 
painful medical condition or perhaps 
you have had no medical complaints at 
all. 
You are suddenly woken up early in 
the morning. You are put in shackles 
and taken not to a general practi-
tioner, but to a gynecologist. 
That 
gynecologist 
performs 
ultrasounds, inserts tools, even his own 
hands into your body without any con-
sent or any lubrication. You are in 
pain. You do not know what is being 
done to you. You feel violently sexu-
ally assaulted. 
The doctor tells you that you have a 
major problem, cysts that must be op-
erated on, from that simple examina-
tion he did. You don’t want surgery 
and you even say so. He says: Okay, I 
will give you a shot instead. 
And because you are scared, you take 
the shot, but you don’t know what it 
is. You haven’t been told what it is. 
You certainly have no idea that, in 
fact, this is a shot that is an injectable 
contraceptive that temporarily pre-
vents you from having children and can 
have other serious side effects, includ-
ing bleeding. 
Now you are bleeding. You are 
scared, and you don’t know what is 
happening. You go back to see the gyn-
ecologist, and he tells you this is why 
he said you must have surgery. 
You have doubts. You want a second 
opinion. But you are told you cannot 
have a second opinion, and it is either 
this or you will never get any care 
again—after all, you are in detention. 
You finally, perhaps in some cases, 
agree to the surgery thinking that you 
are just having cysts removed, but you 
wake up and you find out that you 
have 
had 
a 
full 
or 
partial 
hysterectomy, one of your fallopian 
tubes has been removed or perhaps 
some other surgery that you weren’t 
expecting. 
Imagine that someone has just taken 
away or severely compromised your 
ability to have children without ever 
telling you or asking your consent for 
what they are doing. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here 
today, to vote on House Resolution 
1153, to condemn unwanted, unneces-
sary medical procedures conducted on 
women without their full, informed 
consent, to ensure the safety, health, 
and presence of the women at the Irwin 
County Detention Center, and to man-
date full compliance of ICE with the 
requirements of the ongoing investiga-
tion. 
The story I just described is just one 
of the many stories we have now heard 
from women who are either currently 
or were formerly detained at the Irwin 
County Detention Center in Ocilla, 
Georgia. 
Please understand that 90 percent of 
the people detained at this facility are 
completely unrepresented by any at-
torney. Moreover, like all detention fa-
cilities, Irwin has been plagued with 
COVID. People detained here report 
not receiving adequate PPE, and there 
have been multiple cases of COVID. 
Since this horrific story emerged 
through a whistleblower report 2 weeks 
ago, a few attorneys who are rep-
resenting some of the women have 
brought forward more stories. 
Independent gynecologists have re-
viewed the available medical records. 
The New York Times launched an 
independent investigation, asking inde-
pendent gynecologists to review the 
records of seven women who were able 
to obtain their medical files. What 
they found is deeply disturbing. 
The doctors noted that the gyne-
cologist ‘‘seemed to consistently rec-
ommended surgical intervention, even 
when it did not seem medically nec-
essary at the time and nonsurgical 
treatment options were available.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a September 29 New York Times arti-
cle, titled: ‘‘Immigrants Say They 
Were Pressured Into Unneeded Sur-
geries.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2020] 
IMMIGRANTS SAY THEY WERE PRESSURED INTO 
UNNEEDED SURGERIES 
IMMIGRANTS DETAINED AT AN ICE-CONTRACTED 
CENTER IN GEORGIA SAID THEY HAD INVASIVE 
GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES THAT THEY LATER 
LEARNED MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARY 
(By Caitlin Dickerson, Seth Freed Wessler 
and Miriam Jordan) 
Wendy Dowe was startled awake early one 
morning in January 2019, when guards called 
her out of her cellblock in the Irwin County 
immigration detention center in rural Geor-
gia, where she had been held for four months. 
She would be having surgery that day, they 
said. 
Still groggy, the 48-year-old immigrant 
from Jamaica, who had been living without 
legal status in the United States for two dec-
ades before she was picked up by immigra-
tion authorities, felt a swell of dread come 
over her. An outside gynecologist who saw 
patients in immigration custody told her 
that the menstrual cramping she had was 
caused by large cysts and masses that needed 
to be removed, but she was skeptical. The 
doctor insisted, she said, and as a detainee— 
brought to the hospital in handcuffs and 
shackles—she felt pressured to consent. 
It was only after she was deported to Ja-
maica and had her medical files reviewed by 
several other doctors that she knew she had 
been right to raise questions. 
A radiologist’s report, based on images of 
her internal organs from her time at Irwin, 
described her uterus as being a healthy size, 
not swollen with enlarged masses and cysts, 
as the doctor had written in his notes. The 
cysts she had were small, and the kind that 
occur naturally and do not usually require 
surgical intervention. 
‘‘I didn’t have to do any of it,’’ Ms. Dowe 
said. 
The Irwin County Detention Center in 
Ocilla, Ga., drew national attention this 
month after a nurse, Dawn Wooten, filed a 
whistle-blower complaint claiming that de-
tainees had told her they had had their 
uteruses removed without their full under-
standing or consent. 
Since then, both ICE and the hospital in 
Irwin County have released data that show 
that two full hysterectomies have been per-
formed on women detained at Irwin in the 
past three years. But firsthand accounts are 
now emerging from detainees, including Ms. 
Dowe, who underwent other invasive gyneco-
logical procedures that they did not fully un-
derstand and, in some cases, may not have 
been medically necessary. 
At least one lawyer brought the com-
plaints about gynecological care to the at-
tention of the center’s top officials in 2018, 
according to emails obtained by The New 
York Times, but the outside referrals contin-
ued. 
The Times interviewed 16 women who were 
concerned about the gynecological care they 
received while at the center, and conducted a 
detailed review of the medical files of seven 
women who were able to obtain their 
records. All 16 were treated by Dr. Mahendra 
Amin, who practices gynecology in the near-
by town of Douglas and has been described 
by ICE officials as the detention center’s 
‘‘primary gynecologist.’’ 
The cases were reviewed by five gyne-
cologists—four of them board-certified and 
all with medical school affiliations—who 
found that Dr. Amin consistently overstated 
the size or risks associated with cysts or 
masses attached to his patients’ reproduc-
tive organs. Small or benign cysts do not 
typically call for surgical intervention, 
where large or otherwise troubling ones 
sometimes do, the experts said. 
The doctors stressed that in some cases the 
medical files might not have been complete 
and that additional information could poten-
tially shift their analyses. But they noted 
that Dr. Amin seemed to consistently rec-
ommend surgical intervention, even when it 
did not seem medically necessary at the 
time and nonsurgical treatment options were 
available. 
In almost every woman’s chart, Dr. Amin 
listed symptoms such as heavy bleeding with 
clots and chronic pelvic pain, which could 
justify surgery. But some of the women said 
they never experienced or reported those 
symptoms to him. 
Both the reviewing doctors and all of the 
women interviewed by The Times raised con-
cerns about whether Dr. Amin had ade-
quately explained the procedures he per-
formed or provided his patients with less 
invasive 
alternatives. 
Spanish-speaking 
women said a nurse who spoke Spanish was 
only 
sporadically 
present 
during 
their 
exams. 
The diagnoses and procedures are ‘‘poorly 
supported’’ and ‘‘not well documented,’’ said 
Dr. Sara Imershein, a clinical professor at 
George 
Washington 
University 
and 
the 
Washington, DC, chair of the American Col-
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
Even if the patients had reported the 
symptoms recorded by Dr. Amin, ‘‘there 
would have been many avenues to pursue be-
fore rushing to surgery,’’ she said. ‘‘Advil for 
one.’’ 
‘‘He is overly aggressive in his treatment 
and does not explore appropriate medical 
management before turning to procedures or 
surgical intervention,’’ said Dr. Deborah 
Ottenheimer, a forensic evaluator and in-
structor at the Weill Cornell Medical School 
Human Rights Clinic. 
But the doctors who reviewed the cases 
noted that aggressive overtreatment is all 
too common among doctors—especially with 
patients who do not have the resources to 
seek a second opinion. 
Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE 
Health Service Corps, said in a statement 
that the whistle-blower’s allegations ‘‘raise 
some very serious concerns that deserve to 
be investigated quickly and thoroughly.’’ 
She added, ‘‘If there is any truth to these al-
legations, it is my commitment to make the 
corrections necessary to ensure we continue 
to prioritize the health, welfare and safety of 
ICE detainees.’’ 
Dr. Amin’s lawyer, Scott Grubman, said in 
a statement that the physician ‘‘strongly 
disputes any allegations that he treated any 
patient with anything other than the utmost 
care and respect.’’

October 2, 2020 
‘‘Dr. Amin also strongly disputes that any 
patient was treated without full informed 
consent,’’ the statement continued. Mr. 
Grubman said that patient privacy laws pre-
vented him from discussing any specific pa-
tient’s treatment, but in each case it ‘‘was 
medically necessary, performed within the 
standard of care, and done only after obtain-
ing full informed consent.’’ 
The statement added that Dr. Amin always 
uses an interpreter when treating patients 
who do not speak English and ‘‘always at-
tempts to treat his patients with more con-
servative treatment, including medicine and 
less invasive procedures, before even recom-
mending surgery,’’ which he views as a last 
resort. 
Independent doctors that provide treat-
ment for ICE detainees are paid for the pro-
cedures they perform with Department of 
Homeland Security funds. Procedures like 
the ones that Dr. Amin performed are nor-
mally billed at thousands of dollars each. 
Dr. Amin’s billings had previously come to 
the attention of federal authorities. In 2013, 
the Justice Department named him in a civil 
case alleging that he and several other doc-
tors had overbilled Medicare and Medicaid 
by, among other things, performing unneces-
sary procedures on terminal patients and 
leaving the emergency room staffed by 
nurses while billing for diagnoses and treat-
ments as if they had been performed by doc-
tors. The case was settled for $520,000 with no 
admission of fault on the part of the defend-
ants. 
‘I COULD NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS’ 
In many cases, Dr. Amin’s patients said 
they were confused about why they ended up 
being sent to his office in the first place— 
some after raising medical issues that had 
nothing to do with gynecology. 
Yuridia, a 36-year-old immigrant from 
Mexico, sought out a nurse at the center 
soon after she arrived because she was hav-
ing pain in her rib after a fight with her abu-
sive ex-partner just before she was picked up 
by ICE. She asked to be identified by her 
first name because she feared for her safety. 
She was sent for a medical exam at Dr. 
Amin’s office, where she said he began to 
prepare an ultrasound machine. ‘‘I was as-
suming they were going to check my rib,’’ 
she said. ‘‘The next thing I know, he’s doing 
a vaginal exam.’’ 
Dr. Amin recorded in his notes that 
Yuridia had cysts in her ovaries and sched-
uled a surgery to remove them. He also 
wrote that she had complained of heavy 
menstruation and pelvic pain. She said that 
she never experienced or reported those con-
ditions and that she had not asked to see a 
gynecologist. 
Weeks later, she underwent surgery. Pa-
thology reports show that she did not have 
dangerous cysts, but small ones of the kind 
that occur naturally in most women and do 
not call for surgical intervention. 
Yuridia said she had expected only a minor 
procedure 
that 
would 
be 
performed 
vaginally, but she was surprised when she 
woke up to find three incisions on her abdo-
men and a piece of skin missing from her 
genital area. 
‘‘I woke up and I was alone, and I was in 
pain and everyone spoke English so I could 
not ask any questions,’’ Yuridia said. Three 
days later, still sore and recovering, she was 
deported. 
Yuridia’s case bears striking similarities 
to others that the panel of doctors reviewed. 
Many of them led to two surgical procedures 
performed simultaneously: ‘‘dilation and 
curettage,’’ often referred to as a ‘‘D & C,’’ 
which involves inserting tools into a wom-
an’s vagina and scraping tissue from the 
uterus, and laparoscopy, in which three inci-
sions are made to insert a camera into the 
abdominal cavity to examine or perform pro-
cedures on the reproductive organs. 
The cases suggest a pattern of ‘‘excessively 
aggressive 
surgical 
intervention 
without 
adequate trial of medical remedies,’’ Dr. 
Ottenheimer said. 
A REPORT REVEALS LONGSTANDING COMPLAINTS 
It was the Irwin County center’s handling 
of the coronavirus pandemic that inspired 
Ms. Wooten, the nurse whose whistle-blower 
complaint was first reported by The Inter-
cept, to come forward about another issue 
that troubled her: Dr. Amin’s surgeries. She 
said in an interview that she had for years 
noticed that an inordinate number of women 
were being referred to Dr. Amin. She said she 
would hear reports that they had undergone 
surgeries but that they had no idea why the 
surgeries were performed. 
‘‘After they get up from general anes-
thesia,’’ Ms. Wooten said, the women would 
ask, ‘‘Why’d I have this surgery?’’ 
‘‘And I don’t have an answer for why,’’ she 
said. ‘‘I am just as shocked as they are. No-
body explained it to them.’’ 
Data from ICE inspection reports show 
that the center, which is operated by a pri-
vate prison company, Lasalle Corrections, 
refers more than 1,000 detainees a year for 
outside medical care, far more than most 
other immigration detention centers of the 
same size. It is not clear how many of these 
referrals are for gynecological care. Lasalle 
Corrections did not respond to requests for 
comment. 
Concerns from women detained at Irwin 
emerged long before Ms. Wooten came for-
ward. 
Ms. Dowe, after being told by Dr. Amin 
that she had a mass the size of a ‘‘canta-
loupe’’ on her uterus, had reached out in 
early 2019 to Donald Anthonyson, an immi-
grant advocate she had met through a fellow 
detainee. She was asking for help, Mr. 
Anthonyson said. 
‘‘She expressed real concerns about going 
to that doctor,’’ he said. ‘‘She was concerned 
about what was happening to her and what 
she was hearing from other women.’’ 
Unlike some of the women who had no gyn-
ecological complaints, Ms. Dowe was experi-
encing intense menstrual cramping, which 
the doctors who reviewed her case said could 
sometimes justify the procedure she under-
went—but only if the patient understands 
the options and elects to move forward. Even 
then, the doctors raised questions about sev-
eral seemingly healthy and naturally occur-
ring cysts that Dr. Amin might have re-
moved unnecessarily while he was operating 
on her. 
After the procedure, Dr. Amin wrote in his 
notes that Ms. Dowe requested a second sur-
gery—a full abdominal hysterectomy and re-
moval of her ovaries. 
But Ms. Dowe insists she never made any 
such request. A note in her medical records 
from the detention center appears to cor-
roborate her denial. ‘‘Detainee is requesting 
a second opinion to have a hysterectomy,’’ it 
reads, ‘‘OB/GYN scheduled hysterectomy and 
patient refused.’’ 
Complaints about Dr. Amin had also been 
raised with senior officials long before Ms. 
Dowe’s case. 
In November 2018, a woman named Nancy 
Gonzalez Hidalgo was left shaken after sev-
eral visits with the physician, during which 
she 
said 
he 
performed 
rough 
vaginal 
ultrasounds and ignored her when she cried 
out in pain. Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo’s lawyers 
sent an email to the warden of the center, 
David Paulk. 
In the email, Erin Argueta, a lawyer at the 
Southern Poverty Law Center, explained 
that Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo’s health was wors-
ening because of complications she was expe-
riencing from an earlier miscarriage. 
‘‘Nancy hesitated to seek medical atten-
tion because her last experience with Dr. 
Amin was so painful and traumatic that she 
did not want to be sent back to him,’’ Ms. 
Argueta wrote. 
She referred in her email to several pre-
vious verbal complaints about Dr. Amin that 
lawyers had taken to the center’s inmates 
services director, Marteka George. ‘‘Ms. 
George stated that this was not the first 
time someone complained about Dr. Amin, 
and she said that she would look into wheth-
er Nancy could see a different provider,’’ the 
lawyer wrote. 
The warden responded twice, stating on 
Nov. 30 that Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo had been 
scheduled for an appointment with an out-
side provider ‘‘that is unassociated with Dr. 
Amin.’’ The other doctor, Warden Paulk 
said, was ‘‘reportedly well thought of by his 
patients.’’ 
Warden Paulk did not respond to requests 
for comment. 
Other women who questioned Dr. Amin’s 
care in the past said they had also faced 
challenges when they tried to seek answers. 
On the morning of Aug. 14, Mileidy 
Cardentey Fernandez said, there was no in-
terpreter present at the Irwin County Hos-
pital when she was presented with consent 
forms in English to sign for a procedure she 
was undergoing that day. 
She 
asked 
the 
technician, 
‘‘Spanish, 
please? Little English.’’ The woman urged 
her to sign the forms—and so she did. 
Afterward, she said, she filled out a form 
on numerous occasions at the detention cen-
ter requesting her medical records but got no 
response. 
‘‘I wanted to know everything they had 
done,’’ she said. ‘‘I made requests for the bi-
opsy, analyses, and they don’t want to give 
them to me. They said they don’t have the 
results. How can they not have the results?’’ 
When she was released from detention on 
Sept. 21, she called her daughter in Virginia 
and then headed straight to Dr. Amin’s clin-
ic with her lawyer to demand her records, 
which she received. 
Some women said they had managed to 
avoid surgeries by Dr. Amin but not without 
facing resistance. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this is 
about full or partial sterilization and a 
total lack of consent from the patient. 
And let’s be very clear: Even if a proce-
dure or test is medically necessary, a 
doctor must have informed consent 
from their patient. This is the most 
basic tenet of medical ethics. 
Last weekend, 10 Members of Con-
gress visited the detention center and 
we spoke directly to the women. We 
saw their pain and shock and horror 
about the irreparable damage that has 
been done to them and their futures. 
I have here letters from dozens of 
women at the center detailing some of 
these things that they have seen and 
experienced, including these unneces-
sary medical procedures. To bring their 
voices directly into this Chamber, let 
me read from one of them. 
A woman married to a U.S. citizen 
and with children of her own: 
My experience here has been full of 
fear and terror. It began when I asked 
for medication for my abdomen. My 
surprise when I was taken to the gyne-
cologist, he didn’t explain nothing and 
just told me to lay down and inserted 
something and said I had a cyst the

size of a nail. I was injected and didn’t 
say for what, and said the results 
would be here in 3 weeks; if not, I 
would come back. When everything 
that’s been happening has come to 
light, I was never taken back thanks to 
God because, if not, I would have had 
surgery. 
This resolution is simple. It man-
dates that a real investigation must 
happen. Even just this morning we had 
to once again ensure that a woman who 
had this surgery done to her was not 
once again arrested. We need to allow 
these women to heal as we get this in-
vestigation done in the speediest of 
manners. 
Passing this resolution also sends a 
clear message to doctors contracted by 
the private for-profit incarceration fa-
cilities everywhere: We will not stand 
by and allow you to treat people this 
way. We will not stand by and allow 
history to repeat itself, a shameful his-
tory of medical abuse targeting Black 
people, indigenous people, people of 
color, immigrants, poor people, and 
people with disabilities for medical 
procedures without consent. 
To the women at Irwin, those lucky 
enough to have been released and those 
who have already been deported: You 
are brave and resilient. You should 
know that the United States Congress, 
with the passage of this resolution, is 
saying to you: We see you; we hear you; 
and we will not stop fighting for you. 
I thank my colleagues and coleads of 
this resolution, Representatives ANNIE 
KUSTER, SHEILA JACKSON LEE, SYLVIA 
GARCIA, and LOIS FRANKEL, for intro-
ducing this resolution with me that 
now has the support of 225 Members of 
Congress and, also, the Women’s Cau-
cus for their tremendous attention to 
this resolution, as well as the Congres-
sional Hispanic Caucus that helped 
lead the codel with the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, my chief of staff is a 
former naval captain who commanded 
the aircraft carrier USS Constellation in 
the 1990s. I once asked him what was 
the most important thing he had 
learned during his distinguished naval 
career, and he said: The first reports 
are always wrong. 
That is why I would urge my friends 
on the other side of the aisle to take a 
step back and await the investigations 
that are now underway to determine 
exactly what happened at the Irwin 
County Detention Center, lest they ap-
pear in retrospect to have behaved, 
well, rather prematurely and foolishly. 
This resolution affirms allegations 
that women detained by ICE for the 
crime of illegally crossing the border 
underwent 
unwanted, 
unnecessary 
medical procedures, including full or 
partial hysterectomies and other pro-
cedures involving their reproductive 
organs performed without their knowl-
edge or consent. 
Well, if that is true, it is appalling, 
and those responsible should be held 
fully accountable. 
The acting ICE Director, Tony Pham, 
said precisely that on September 18. He 
said: ‘‘The recent allegations by the 
independent 
contracted 
employee 
raised some very serious concerns that 
deserve to be investigated quickly and 
thoroughly. ICE welcomes the efforts 
of both the Office of Inspector General 
as well as the Department of Homeland 
Security’s parallel review. 
‘‘As a former prosecutor, individuals 
found to have violated our policies and 
procedures should be held accountable. 
If there is any truth to these allega-
tions, it is my commitment to make 
the corrections necessary to ensure 
that we continue to prioritize the 
health, welfare, and safety of ICE de-
tainees.’’ 
Of course, this resolution makes no 
acknowledgment of Mr. Pham’s state-
ment or of the investigations that are 
now underway. 
The reality is, at this point, we do 
not have all the facts. 
We do know that the complaint by 
the group Project South, which insti-
gated the allegations, did not contain 
testimony from a single woman who 
had a hysterectomy while detained at 
the Irwin County Detention Facility. 
We know that ICE has an annual 
third-party inspection of its detention 
facilities, including the medical care at 
those facilities. 
We know that ICE has performance- 
based national detention standards, 
which include high standards for wom-
en’s medical care. 
We know that the 2019 third-party in-
spection conducted by the Nakamoto 
Group found that the Irwin County De-
tention Center met ICE’s performance- 
based national detention standards. 
We know that on September 18 the 
Associated Press reported: ‘‘The AP’s 
review did not find evidence of mass 
hysterectomies as alleged in a widely 
shared complaint filed by a nurse at 
the detention center.’’ 
That is the Associated Press. 
b 0930 
We know that on September 22, The 
Washington Post reported that since 
2017, only two women in immigration 
custody were referred to the Irwin 
County Hospital for hysterectomies 
and that there are no other facilities in 
the region that perform that proce-
dure. ICE reports there may have been 
three. But the attorney for the hospital 
calls the claims that we have just 
heard demonstrably false. His words, 
‘‘demonstrably false.’’ 
We know that on September 15, The 
Washington Post reported that the 
lawyer who filed the lawsuit on behalf 
of the pro-illegal-immigration group 
‘‘acknowledged 
to 
The 
Washington 
Post that she did not speak to any 
women who had a forced sterilization, 
and said she included the allegations in 
the report with the intention of trig-
gering an investigation into whether or 
not the claims were true.’’ 
Whether or not the claims were true. 
Well, we are going to find out, and once 
we have all the facts, we can make ra-
tional decisions about what to do, but 
this resolution simply assumes the al-
legations are true and condemns the 
institution as if they were true. It then 
calls for indefinite postponement of the 
deportation of any illegal immigrant 
at this facility that has any medical 
procedure, which I assume would in-
clude routine medical screenings. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask the House 
this very simple question: Wouldn’t it 
be better to let the investigation take 
its course, have all the facts laid out 
before us, and then take appropriate 
actions? 
If the allegations are true, every bit 
of the indignation expressed in this res-
olution and by my Democratic col-
leagues would be justified, and a 
united, bipartisan Congress would de-
mand and command redress and re-
form. 
But if the allegations are found not 
to be true, this House, that is already 
plumbing the depths of public ridicule 
and derision, will once again have di-
minished its credibility and its moral 
authority to speak out on this or any 
other issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), my good col-
league on the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, for 
most of the past century, the United 
States has led the world in the pro-
motion of human rights. People from 
all over the world have long come to 
America seeking refuge and a better 
life. And in our best moments, we wel-
come them with open arms. 
Yet under the Trump administration, 
immigrants have been met with great 
hostility. On Trump’s watch, children 
have been separated from their fami-
lies and endured unspeakable trauma 
in DHS custody. 
In just the past few weeks, new and 
horrific 
allegations 
have 
emerged 
about the use of forced sterilization on 
immigrant women by ICE, allegations 
so serious and sickening, that they de-
mand a swift and thorough investiga-
tion. 
According to one nurse who worked 
at the Irwin County Detention Center 
in Georgia, immigrant women received 
unnecessary hysterectomies, records 
were destroyed, and migrants were not 
tested for COVID–19. 
In the words of one immigrant held 
at the facility, ‘‘When I met all these 
women who had surgeries, I thought 
this was like an experimental con-
centration camp. It was like they are 
experimenting with our bodies.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, these allegations are 
horrifying. 
If true, they are a gross violation of 
human rights and a violation of the

most basic ethics that medical profes-
sionals are sworn to uphold. 
What is more, there is a long history 
of forced sterilizations, like the proce-
dures found in these allegations, being 
used against people of color, religious 
minorities, prisoners, individuals with 
disabilities, and other vulnerable com-
munities. 
Such procedures are not only wrong, 
but they rise to the level of gross 
human rights abuses. 
That is why it is so important that 
these shocking and staggering allega-
tions be investigated now and anyone 
who participated in such abuses be held 
fully accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to end by thank-
ing all of my colleagues, but in par-
ticular, 
my 
friend 
Congresswoman 
PRAMILA
JAYAPAL, a champion for 
human rights here and around the 
world, someone who has led this effort 
and authored H. Res. 1153 to condemn 
forced medical procedures on individ-
uals without their full, informed con-
cept. I thank her for her leadership and 
for this powerful message that we are 
sending to ICE and to the world that 
we will not tolerate this kind of behav-
ior. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the resolution. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. JOHNSON), my good colleague, 
who was on the delegation with us. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in full support of this resolu-
tion offered by my colleague, my dear 
colleague, PRAMILA JAYAPAL and oth-
ers. I thank her for her hard work. 
Halloween is getting close, but it is 
Halloween every day at the Irwin 
County Detention Center. 
Many of the police officers just out-
side the facility when we arrived were 
not wearing masks, and it was only the 
day before our visit that detainees 
were issued masks. Prior to that, many 
had worn the mask they had had on 
when they were first booked into the 
facility many months ago. Some had 
been wearing old panties as masks. 
But the horror stories were the expe-
riences these women told of being sub-
jected to gynecological surgery, intru-
sions into their body absent their in-
formed consent. 
As these women spoke, their eyes re-
vealed the horror of what had been 
done to them. Many clutched or rubbed 
their midsection, still in physical pain 
as they recounted what they had been 
through and the mental and physical 
pain they still endure after being trau-
matized by Dr. Amin. 
The Irwin County Detention Center 
is managed by a for-profit corporation. 
That industry’s stock went through the 
roof when Trump was elected. He has 
delivered on their investment, and it 
has been open season on detainees ever 
since. 
These companies rake in billions in 
taxpayer dollars to house, clothe, and 
feed detainees. Some of the women had 
been issued deportation orders 6, 8 
months, even a year ago, but they are 
still being detained, and taxpayers foot 
the bill so that corporations can maxi-
mize huge profits. They profit by pay-
ing slave wages to detainees to cook 
and clean the facility. They profit off 
of phone calls in the commissary. 
Somebody is also profiting off of 
churning these women’s bodies for un-
necessary medical procedures, paid for 
by the taxpayers. 
This is not right. It is immoral to 
profit off of human suffering and mis-
ery. 
This horror show must end. We need 
to shut it down and shut it down now. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA), my distinguished 
co-lead on this resolution, a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Ms. JAYAPAL) for yielding me 
the time. 
This weekend, several of my col-
leagues and I visited the Irwin County 
ICE Detention Center, and what we saw 
and heard was outrageous and heart-
breaking. 
We 
heard 
stories 
directly 
from 
women who were subjected to unneces-
sary and unwanted medical procedures 
without their consent. And yet yester-
day, some of our friends across the 
aisle suggested that some of this may 
be made up, that this is not real. 
Well, here I have some statements I 
received directly from the detainees 
this past weekend, and I am going to 
read from these, written in their own 
hands, for the RECORD. They are in 
Spanish, but they will be translated 
into English. 
This letter was signed by 24 detain-
ees. The women said: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
They do not understand what is hap-
pening to their body, nor what they did 
to their body. 
‘‘No entienden que esta´ pasando con 
su cuerpo, ni que hicieron con su 
cuerpo’’. 
Mr. Speaker, imagine if you were put 
under in surgery and were not told 
what was being done to your body, and 
you went through the surgery. This is 
what is happening to some of these 
women. 
They went on to say: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
‘‘They ‘told’ them they were going to 
perform a study and they deceived 
them. Because a surgery room should 
not be a school.’’ 
‘‘Le vamos a hacer un estudio les 
‘dijeron’ y las habe´is engan˜ ado. Porque 
una sala de cirugı´as no debe ser una 
escuela’’. 
Now, that is alarming if it is true. 
They were performing a study, and 
they deceived them. Because the sur-
gery room should not be a school. 
Mr. Speaker, imagine if you were 
told they were doing a study on your 
body and not being told what for or 
what any side effects may be. Nothing, 
nada, is what these women were told. 
They also said: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
‘‘Why are we being punished? You 
send us to a ‘crazy’ person that muti-
lates bodies. And they deport us so that 
we don’t say anything.’’ 
‘‘¿Por que´
nos castigan ma´s? Nos 
mandan con un ‘loco’, despiadado que 
mutila cuerpos. Y nos deportan para 
que nadie diga nada. . .’’, imagine if 
you were told they were doing a study 
on your body and not being told what 
for or what any side effects may be. 
Nothing, nada, is what these women 
were told. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, again, imagine 
having your body mutilated and then 
being deported to have you silenced. 
This is what is happening to some of 
these women. 
When I asked three of the detainees I 
spoke to if they ever got an expla-
nation of any of this in their own lan-
guage, if they had the procedure and 
their options explained to them, and if 
they understood the chilling effect of 
these surgeries, all three of them 
laughed almost in unison at me, and 
they responded: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
‘‘Of course not.’’ 
‘‘Claro que no.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair reminds the gentlewoman that 
she will need to provide the Clerk a 
translation for the RECORD. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
many women have been violated in the 
most horrific way imaginable. One re-
layed having a doctor, without expla-
nation, putting his hands in her vagina 
without gloves. That is an assault in 
my book, and we need to recognize it 
as such. 
Many remain confused about what 
was done to their bodies. Some had 
life-altering surgeries performed on 
them without consenting or truly un-
derstanding the long-term repercus-
sions on their reproductive health. 
These actions recall a time in our 
history when Black and Brown women 
were subjected to forced sterilizations 
and medical experiments. 
This cannot be allowed to happen in 
America today. We can never let it 
happen ever again. 
This resolution, Mr. Speaker, in my 
mind, is just a first step in getting jus-
tice for these women. 
We need to shut down the Irwin ICE 
Detention Center pending all investiga-
tions. The detainees should be released 
to their families or sponsors so they 
can get a complete medical review. 
We must get to the bottom of this 
and make sure that it is stopped. And 
the FBI must investigate LaSalle Cor-
rections and its contractors, especially 
the medical staff and the doctor, for 
any conflict of interest, any self-deal-
ing, and any possible fraudulent bill-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the most horrific 
example of human rights violations I 
have ever seen, and sadly, it is hap-
pening here in our very own country, 
and it must be stopped.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5650 
October 2, 2020 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT), my good col-
league, who was also on the codel with 
us. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman NADLER, I thank Ms. 
JAYAPAL for advancing this important 
resolution. 
Last week I visited the Irwin Deten-
tion Center in Georgia along with a 
dozen of my colleagues. 
I have visited some of these ICE de-
tention centers before, and I have seen 
the horrible conditions that immi-
grants and refugees face across the 
country. We all remember the unspeak-
able stories about how children were 
separated from their mothers and fa-
thers and how they cried for them in 
the middle of the night and how they 
were separated thousands of miles 
apart. 
Mr. Speaker, I came to the United 
States from the Dominican Republic as 
a young boy knowing this Nation was a 
beacon of hope and opportunity. 
Never in my wildest dream did I ever 
think that I would be a Member of Con-
gress. But I also never had the night-
mare that I would be summoned, that I 
would be asked to investigate this hor-
ror story that has manifested itself at 
Irwin. 
While there, I spoke to a handful of 
women whose stories made me so angry 
about this country, the country that I 
had grown to love, angry about how 
our laws have been twisted by a sick 
administration that treats innocent 
women so cruelly, women who want 
nothing more than the same freedom 
and opportunities that I once sought 
myself, women who put their lives on 
the line to get here. 
b 0945 
I spoke to a woman from the DR who 
crossed el Canal de la Mona with 30 
men and 3 other women, 7 days in the 
Caribbean Sea only to have, later on, 
her health and well-being put in great 
risk by the U.S. Government itself. 
One of them told me that she was 
treated like an animal, that the appro-
priate instruments that needed to be 
used for her tests were not used, that 
there were invasive and aggressive 
tests. She told me that the doctor 
stuck his hand on her private parts, 
Mr. Speaker. 
I am told one woman has been bleed-
ing for more than 2 weeks. 
Let’s shut down this center. Let’s ar-
rest the doctors and anybody that was 
involved in perpetrating this crime. 
Let’s shut down Irwin right now, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GARCI´A), my distinguished col-
league. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of Congress-
woman JAYAPAL’s resolution to con-
demn unwanted and unnecessary med-
ical procedures without the full, in-
formed consent of individuals. 
From the 1930s to the 1970s, Puerto 
Rican women were sterilized in order 
to control population growth. Through-
out the 1960s and 1970s, anti-immigrant 
sentiment resulted in the highest num-
ber of recorded state-sanctioned steri-
lizations of Mexican women in Cali-
fornia. 
Now, in 2020, we learn of allegations 
that immigrant women in ICE custody 
are 
being 
subjected 
to 
forced 
hysterectomies. 
The stories we have heard from Geor-
gia’s Irwin County Detention Center 
are horrendous but, sadly, not new. 
They are a reminder of our country’s 
dark history of forcing women of color 
to be sterilized. 
Robbing Black and Brown women of 
full autonomy over their bodies and re-
productive freedoms is white suprem-
acy in action. In any other country, we 
would denounce these horrific inci-
dents as violations of human rights. 
I stand with my colleagues in strong 
support of the resolution to condemn 
these atrocities and hold those in-
volved accountable. 
I am disgusted but not surprised. 
This administration has dehumanized 
immigrants 
time 
and 
time 
again. 
Those 
seeking 
asylum 
have 
been 
stripped of their dignity, and some are 
now scarred for life. This is a violation 
of human rights, a violation of human 
dignity, and an atrocious violation of 
privacy and safety. 
What happened in Georgia is criminal 
and must be condemned so that it may 
never happen again. I strongly urge 
adoption of this resolution. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from California (Mr. RUIZ), who 
is a doctor himself and provided very, 
very important feedback on the codel 
as he came with us. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the Judiciary Committee and 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for 
organizing the trip to Irwin County De-
tention Center. I was one of those who 
went to witness firsthand what was 
going on. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
JAYAPAL for this resolution and her 
leadership in this matter. 
As a medical and public health ex-
pert, I have found three gross cat-
egories of violations in Irwin County 
Detention Center. 
One is there were not sufficient pre-
cautions to prevent COVID–19 from 
causing an outbreak in the facilities. 
There was only one mask issued upon 
arrival, and the second mask was not 
issued until the day before we arrived, 
knowing we were going to arrive. Some 
women were there for 6, 7 months. 
The second is that there was a 
COVID–19 positive patient in the facil-
ity, yet at the medical quarters, no-
body was wearing an N95 mask, which 
could put the staff and other people in 
jeopardy. The COVID–19 patient was re-
ported to be in isolation during the 
time that we were there. 
Furthermore, the second problem in 
public health is the lack of hygiene 
maintenance in the facility. There 
were reports that the curtains were in-
fested with mold. There was mold in 
the showers. Clothing hadn’t been 
washed. They were issued sweatpants 
and sweatshirts; they were visibly 
dirty and torn. 
When I inspected the showers myself, 
I saw that, in fact, there was mold in 
the showers. The curtains were re-
placed the day before or 2 days before 
we had arrived. So that is a problem in 
the face of human dignity and also in 
requiring personal hygiene to stay safe 
from COVID–19. 
Furthermore, going back to the first 
category, I forgot to mention that the 
bunk beds were very small, and they 
were only 3 feet apart in their sleeping 
quarters, so that was also not following 
CDC recommendations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from California an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. RUIZ. In terms of the third viola-
tion, which is the most outstanding 
and outrageous violation, it was that 
procedures were done without the 
women’s informed consent. There were 
gynecological procedures, as was men-
tioned: 
total 
hysterectomy; 
partial 
hysterectomy; most of them were 
oophorectomies; most of them were 
cystectomies. 
But the point here is that whenever 
you have any gynecological procedure, 
that can result in scarring, future pain, 
possible chronic pain, and also infer-
tility. Therefore, you need informed 
consent. 
It is medical practice to have in-
formed consent, which requires an ex-
planation of your disease, of the ill-
ness, of the procedure, including risks 
and any alternative options, including 
the option of doing nothing, in the lan-
guage that the patient understands. 
Not doing so, not documenting it, is 
a violation of that informed consent. 
Violating informed consent and put-
ting a blade to a woman’s body, with-
out her understanding or her informed 
consent, is an assault. 
That is why we need fully to con-
demn this practice. That is why we 
need to fully investigate through the 
inspector general, through the FBI, 
through the Georgia medical and sur-
geon license board to ensure that this 
doesn’t happen, that it is not hap-
pening in other private detention fa-
cilities throughout the country, in 
rural areas where perhaps they think 
they might get away with it because, 
after all, these are very disempowered 
women without very strong advocacy 
in those locations. 
I am very thankful for the lawyers, 
for those that brought this to light,

that have empowered the voices, in-
cluding a 22-year-old woman who now 
will never be able to have children. 
I support this resolution to send a 
very strong message to all facilities 
and all doctors that every woman re-
quires fully informed consent before 
any procedure. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my distin-
guished and wonderful colleague who 
has been on the front lines of this issue 
since it started and has already pro-
vided so much to the women who have 
been detained at Irwin. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
awoke this morning to daunting news 
in this Nation, and I know that the Na-
tion prays. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Washington for her distinguished 
service, and our fellow coleaders and 
cosponsors, 
Congresswomen 
KUSTER, 
GARCIA, and FRANKEL, and, really, all 
of those who rose in the immediacy of 
our visit to be able to sign on to H. 
Res. 1153. 
In the spirit of our late friend and 
colleague, America is better than this. 
America is better than this. 
First, to my Republican friends, I 
hope that they will rise today and vote 
for this legislation. If they read it, 
they will understand there is no con-
demnation of ICE. There is account-
ability that each and every one of us 
who serves the people of the United 
States is obligated to do. We are obli-
gated to be accountable. We are obli-
gated to treat every human being with 
decency. 
Though this is a circumstance that 
pained my heart, am I reminded of the 
man that killed nine at Mother Eman-
uel Church and was taken to get a 
burger before he was taken to jail be-
cause he said he was hungry. 
No one seems to condemn that. It 
certainly hurt my heart. Nine people of 
faith praying were killed, murdered in 
their church, and left lying in blood. 
But he was taken to get a burger. 
Why should these women be treated 
any less? 
This resolution, why is it so intimi-
dating? All we say is, condemning the 
performance of ‘‘unwanted, unneces-
sary medical procedures on individuals 
without their full, informed consent,’’ 
recognizing that ‘‘everyone deserves to 
control their own reproductive choices 
and make informed choices about their 
bodies.’’ We have been saying that all 
along. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle, I hope they join in that. They 
want a singular path. We say people 
with their God, women with their God, 
their family, and their medical profes-
sional. 
Acknowledges that ‘‘further account-
ability, oversight, and transparency is 
necessary to protect people in the cus-
tody’’ of DHS and ICE, to make sure 
these women are not deported as we 
are in the midst of an inspector gen-
eral’s report. 
Thankful to the Judiciary Com-
mittee, the chairman, and the col-
leagues who led this letter of over 180- 
plus Members. That IG’s investigation 
is proceeding, but they need to have 
those witnesses, and this resolution is 
crucial because it lays out intimate 
facts that we heard personally from 
women. 
I don’t know whenever—I know that 
I was here for debates on partial-birth 
abortion. That is obviously not what it 
was. It was a medical procedure to save 
the mother’s life. But when have we 
ever discussed the private examina-
tions of women, how private we are in 
order to get America to understand 
how this was? 
Women should rise up, not respecting 
their party. They should rise up when 
they know that procedures were done 
without consent—physically touched, 
could not speak English. All women 
seemed to get the same diagnosis: re-
move the Fallopian tube. 
Pauline—I will not call her last 
name—I sat with her for an hour and a 
half, and she described what happened: 
sedated, did not know, told after she 
came out of the sedation, broke down 
in tears. I pay tribute to her. And al-
most about to be on the verge of depor-
tation, a witness. 
The whistleblower, a mother of five 
children, single mother of five chil-
dren, she needed her job. Demoted be-
cause she had the courage to talk 
about examinations, surgeries. 
Only women would understand ex-
aminations without lubricant, young 
women in the prime of fertility, crying. 
Beds—this is a private center con-
tracted by the government. Beds that 
looked like they had been there since 
the 1800s. These were metal beds. I 
have never seen a bunk bed this thin. 
This is a place waiting for COVID–19 
because they are so close. The beds 
themselves are 2 feet to 4 feet away. 
You know what their COVID–19 prac-
tice is for protection? It is to have one 
head this way and one head that way. 
There are no masks. The air is going. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Texas an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. You have no way 
to protect these women in this crowded 
scenario. 
There is a men’s site. By the way, 
this is a for-profit center, so they take 
U.S. Marshals individuals. They take 
county individuals. It is just a pot-
pourri of persons. 
They have women who have been 
there for 3-plus years. 
I don’t blame the workers or even the 
agencies, the subagency. It is the poli-
cies of this administration dealing with 
immigrants who are human beings and 
have due process rights accordingly, as 
being in the United States. 
I leave you with this: Please pass H. 
Res. 1153 because this is drawn by this 
woman who says liberty because we are 
daughters, we are mothers, we are 
human beings. The Nation is better 
than this. 
Vote for H. Res. 1153 to stop these 
procedures and stop these prisons from 
taking advantage of us. 
Mr. Speaker, as a leader of this resolution 
and a senior member of the House Judiciary 
and Homeland Committees, I rise in strong 
support of H. Res. 1153, ‘‘Condemning Un-
wanted, Unnecessary Medical Procedures on 
Individuals Without Their Full, Informed Con-
sent’’. 
First and foremost, I would like to thank my 
fellow co-leads of this resolution, Representa-
tives JAYAPAL, KUSTER, GARCIA, and FRANKEL 
as well as all 224 members who have sup-
ported this resolution. 
H. Res. 1153 addresses the recent allega-
tions of improper medical care of detained 
women in the Irwin County Detention Center 
in Ocilla, Georgia by: condemning the per-
formance of unwanted, unnecessary medical 
procedures on individuals without their full, in-
formed consent; recognizing that everyone de-
serves to control their own reproductive 
choices and make informed choices about 
their bodies; and acknowledges that further 
accountability, oversight, and transparency is 
necessary to protect people in the custody of 
U.S. Immigration and Customs. 
The resolution also calls on the Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS) to pause the re-
moval of any individual who has received any 
medical procedure at the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center as well as allow individuals who 
may have experienced an unnecessary or 
nonconsensual procedure to have immediate 
access to adequate, safe, and consensual 
medical treatment. 
By passing this resolution today, DHS must 
also comply with all investigations and records 
request related to investigations about the 
Irwin County Detention Center, ensure af-
fected individuals are able to freely participate 
in any investigations, and hold all individuals 
involved in perpetrating these instances of 
medical impropriety accountable. 
On September 14, 2020, Project South filed 
an explosive complaint to the Department of 
Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector Gen-
eral. 
The complaint alleged unsafe, unsanitary 
conditions, as well as cited significant num-
bers of full and partial hysterectomies per-
formed on detainees at the Irwin County De-
tention Center without the full and informed 
consent of the patients. 
On September 16, 2020, I was alerted to 
the DHS’ decision to fast-track the deportation 
of a young woman, Pauline Binam, who was 
a victim of improper medical care at the Irwin 
County Detention Center. 
Pauline is a strong, kind, and lovely young 
woman who has lived in the United States 
since she was two years old. 
Since 2017, Pauline had been held in DHS 
custody and was scheduled to be deported to 
Cameroon. 
That is three years of not being able to hold 
her child, embrace her family, or celebrate 
milestones and holidays with loved ones. 
In August 2019, while being detained at the 
Irwin County Detention Center, Pauline under-
went a procedure commonly known as a D&C, 
which she had been told that it was for the 
purpose of getting rid of the cysts on her ova-
ries.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5652 
October 2, 2020 
According to the Mayo Clinic, a D&C proce-
dure is used for the following medical reasons: 
Clearing out tissues that remain in the uterus 
after a miscarriage or abortion to prevent in-
fection or heavy bleeding; Removing a tumor 
that forms instead of a normal pregnancy; 
Treating excessive bleeding after delivery by 
clearing out any placenta that remains in the 
uterus; or Removing cervical or uterine polyps, 
which are usually benign. 
However, when Pauline woke up from the 
anesthesia, she was informed that the doctor 
had removed her fallopian tube during the sur-
gery. 
This medical procedure, which substantially 
impacts Pauline’s potential to have more chil-
dren, was performed without her consent and 
has forever altered Pauline’s life. 
And Pauline is not the only victim. 
Numerous allegations of medical abuse at 
the Irwin County Detention Center have come 
to light over the past few days and weeks. 
These shocking claims of medical mal-
practice reflect widespread medical neglect in 
the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment (ICE) detention system. 
It is imperative that we, as Members of Con-
gress, fulfill our duty to the American people 
and get to the bottom of what happened to the 
women being held at the Irwin County Deten-
tion Center. 
We cannot wait. 
The women in this facility cannot wait. 
We must seek out justice for these women 
immediately, and that starts by voting to pass 
this resolution. 
Furthermore, Pauline and the other women 
who have shared their stories of these vio-
lating and nonconsensual medical procedures 
must have the ability to contribute to this in-
vestigation. 
Had I not intervened and stopped Pauline’s 
deportation when I did, we would have lost a 
key witness to the investigation; someone who 
is vital to shining a light on these cruel, and 
immoral medical procedures performed with-
out full and informed consent. 
We cannot be known as a country that vio-
lates our own laws. 
Just because someone is an immigrant, is 
undocumented, or being detained for deporta-
tion, it does not mean that they can be denied 
their due process rights under the laws of this 
land and under the constitution of the United 
States of America. 
Last weekend, I, along with several other 
Members of Congress, had the opportunity to 
visit the Irwin County Detention Center. 
During that trip, I was able to speak with 
multiple detainees and hear about the living 
circumstances and quality of care surrounding 
their detention at the facility. 
It is no secret that the United States has 
had a long history of women being denied re-
productive rights and being violated medically, 
especially women of color. 
When you perform procedures that disallow 
a woman from making her own choices or 
deny her from making a choice, you are vio-
lating her very humanity, and I will not stand 
idly by and allow it to continue. 
As a woman and a mother, I am appalled 
and horrified by what has been happening to 
these women at the Irwin County Detention 
Center, and I believe that we owe it to them 
to investigate their claims fully. 
I urge my colleagues to vote with their con-
science and pass H. Res. 1153 today. 
b 1000 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
has 
1 
minute remaining. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, John Adams’ famous 
observation bears repeating here today. 
He said: ‘‘Facts are stubborn things; 
and whatever may be our wishes, our 
inclinations, or the dictates of our pas-
sions, they cannot alter the state of 
facts and evidence.’’ 
We have heard a great deal from the 
other side about their passions, but we 
don’t have all the facts. That is what 
the ongoing investigations will provide 
us. 
The facts that stubbornly present 
themselves on this matter here today 
are that the AP found no evidence of 
mass hysterectomies at this facility. 
The hospital that performs them for 
the facility reports that two have been 
performed on ICE detainees since 2017. 
The hospital tells us the allegations 
are 
demonstrably 
false—demon-
strably—in other words, they can prove 
it. The attorney who made the allega-
tions that have given rise to this de-
bate today admitted to The Wash-
ington Post that they were not based 
on any evidence and that she included 
them ‘‘whether or not true’’ to prompt 
the investigation. 
All the wishes and inclinations on 
the other side to abolish ICE, repeal 
our immigration laws, throw our bor-
ders open, all the other things that 
have been proposed from time to time 
and all of the vitriolic passions we have 
heard from the other side today cannot 
alter the state of facts and evidence. 
More facts and evidence will be pre-
sented to us as the investigation 
unfolds, and that will tell us exactly 
what happened at this facility. I would 
strongly advise my friends to await the 
investigation to inform us and to guide 
us. 
My Democratic colleagues are fond of 
saying that we must always follow the 
data. Mr. Speaker, I now commend to 
them their own advice. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying 
to my good colleague across the aisle 
that, when he says that first reports 
are always wrong, let me ask, is that 
like the first reports of family separa-
tion or kids in cages? 
When my colleague says to let the in-
vestigation continue, that is exactly 
what this resolution does. It specifi-
cally defines the ability to keep these 
women who will be witnesses in this in-
vestigation in the United States. In 
fact, just last week we had to, once 
again, make sure that a woman was 
not deported who had her left fallopian 
tube removed, and it was confirmed by 
independent gynecologists. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I really believe 
that we crafted this resolution in a 
way that it could truly be a bipartisan 
resolution and that protects the ability 
for this investigation to continue with 
all the facts on the table, and we are 
grateful that there is an investigation 
going. 
But in order to have a proper inves-
tigation, we need to have these wit-
nesses here. We need to make sure that 
the women who have had these proce-
dures are actually able to get care. And 
we need to make sure that this House 
says very clearly, in any situation, 
that these unnecessary, unwanted med-
ical procedures, if true, done without 
consent and knowledge, are wrong. 
That is all this resolution does. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues on 
the other side will vote ‘‘yes’’ with us 
on this resolution, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1164, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
resolution and on the preamble, as 
amended. 
The question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

from questioning the truth about the Sep-
tember 11th terrorist attacks, to believing in 
alien landings, to denying the safety of vac-
cines; 
Whereas many QAnon followers express 
anti-Semitic views, and the Anti-Defamation 
League has said that the movement’s central 
conspiracy theory includes anti-Semitic ele-
ments; 
Whereas conspiracy theories have been a 
central driver of anti-Semitism for cen-
turies, and QAnon conspiracy theories are 
fanning the flames as anti-Semitism is on 
the rise in the United States and around the 
world; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) has assessed with high confidence 
that ‘‘fringe political conspiracy theories’’, 
including QAnon, ‘‘very likely motivate 
some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, 
to engage in criminal or violent activity’’, 
and that these conspiracy theories ‘‘very 
likely encourage the targeting of specific 
people, places and organizations, thereby in-
creasing the likelihood of violence against 
these targets’’; 
Whereas the FBI bases this assessment on 
‘‘events in which individuals committed 
crimes, plotted attacks, or successfully car-
ried out deadly violence, and who—either be-
fore or after their arrests—attributed their 
actions to their conspiratorial beliefs’’; 
Whereas QAnon adherents have been impli-
cated in crimes that they claim their QAnon 
beliefs inspired, including— 
(1) a man arrested in 2018 for plotting to 
plant a bomb in the Illinois Capitol rotunda 
to make Americans aware of the ‘‘Pizzagate’’ 
conspiracy theory; 
(2) a man arrested in 2018 for using an ar-
mored car to block traffic on the Hoover 
Dam Bypass Bridge; 
(3) a man in Arizona arrested in 2019 for 
vandalizing a Catholic church; 
(4) a woman in Colorado arrested in 2019 for 
plotting an armed raid to kidnap her child, 
who had been taken from her custody; 
(5) a man charged with the murder of an 
organized crime boss in New York in 2019; 
and 
(6) a woman arrested in New York with a 
car full of knives after posting a video accus-
ing Joe Biden of participating in child sex 
trafficking and threatening to kill him; 
Whereas the FBI further assesses that 
‘‘these conspiracy theories very likely will 
emerge, spread and evolve in the modern in-
formation marketplace . . . fostering anti- 
government sentiment, racial and religious 
prejudice, [and] increasing political ten-
sions’’; 
Whereas, according to the Combating Ter-
rorism Center at the United States Military 
Academy at West Point, ‘‘QAnon is arguably 
no longer simply a fringe conspiracy theory 
but an ideology that has demonstrated its 
capacity to radicalize to violence individuals 
at an alarming speed’’; 
Whereas Facebook, Twitter, and Google 
have removed or blocked QAnon groups and 
content from their platforms for violating 
their policies against misinformation, bul-
lying, hate speech, and harassment; 
Whereas QAnon adherents have been harm-
ing legitimate efforts to combat child exploi-
tation and sex trafficking, including by over-
whelming antitrafficking hotlines with false 
reports; 
Whereas the conspiracy theories promoted 
by QAnon undermine trust in America’s 
democratic institutions, encourage rejection 
of objective reality, and deepen our Nation’s 
political polarization; and 
Whereas our Nation’s polarization is fur-
ther accentuated by others, from the far left 
to 
the 
far 
right, 
promoting 
extreme 
ideologies and antigovernment conspiracy 
theories, hijacking legitimate peaceful pro-
tests, and encouraging followers to damage, 
deface, or vandalize local, State, and Federal 
Government properties and to attack law en-
forcement: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns QAnon and rejects the con-
spiracy theories it promotes; 
(2) 
condemns 
all 
other 
groups 
and 
ideologies, from the far left to the far right, 
that contribute to the spread of unfounded 
conspiracy theories and that encourage 
Americans to destroy public and private 
property and attack law enforcement offi-
cers; 
(3) encourages the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation, as well as all Federal law enforce-
ment and homeland security agencies, to 
continue to strengthen their focus on pre-
venting violence, threats, harassment, and 
other criminal activity by extremists moti-
vated by fringe political conspiracy theories; 
(4) encourages the intelligence community 
to uncover any foreign support, assistance, 
or online amplification QAnon receives, as 
well as any QAnon affiliations, coordination, 
and contacts with foreign extremist organi-
zations or groups espousing violence; and 
(5) urges all Americans, regardless of our 
beliefs or partisan affiliation, to seek infor-
mation from authoritative sources and to en-
gage in political debate from a common fac-
tual foundation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and the ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
The gentlewoman from Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL) and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H. Res. 
1154. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, QAnon is a movement 
promoting a collection of unfounded 
conspiracy theories that have spread 
on the internet over the last several 
years. These conspiracy theories under-
mine public trust in our democratic in-
stitutions and our election process, and 
that is why I am pleased to support 
this important, bipartisan resolution 
by Representatives MALINOWSKI
and 
RIGGLEMAN. 
QAnon initially alleged that promi-
nent Americans are engaged in a secret 
plot to control the world while using 
their power to exploit children. It now 
extends to a range of dangerous con-
spiracy theories. The FBI has assessed 
with high confidence that ‘‘fringe polit-
ical conspiracy theories,’’ including 
QAnon, ‘‘very likely to motivate some 
domestic extremists, wholly or in part, 
to engage in criminal or violent activ-
ity and that these conspiracy theories 
very likely encourage the targeting of 
specific people, places, and organiza-
tions, thereby increasing the likeli-
hood of violence against these tar-
gets.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as the Members may 
know, the resolution’s lead sponsor, 
Representative MALINOWSKI, has him-
self faced threats from QAnon sup-
porters after he was falsely accused of 
lobbying to protect sexual predators. 
According to the Combating Ter-
rorism Center at the West Point Mili-
tary Academy: ‘‘QAnon is arguably no 
longer simply a fringe conspiracy the-
ory but an ideology that has dem-
onstrated its capacity to radicalize to 
violence individuals at an alarming 
speed.’’ 
Fortunately, a growing number of po-
litical leaders recognize the threat that 
QAnon poses, and that includes Repub-
lican House Minority Leader KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, who recently said that 
‘‘there is no place for QAnon in the Re-
publican Party.’’ 
The Malinowski-Riggleman resolu-
tion does several things: 
It condemns QAnon and rejects the 
conspiracy theories that it promotes; 
It encourages the FBI and all Federal 
law enforcement agencies to continue 
to strengthen their focus on preventing 
violence, 
threats, 
harassment, 
and 
other criminal activity by extremists 
motivated by fringe political con-
spiracy theories; 
And, finally, it urges all Americans, 
regardless of our beliefs or partisan af-
filiation, to seek information from au-
thoritative sources and to engage in 
political debate from a common, fac-
tual foundation. 
I would hope that these are principles 
we could all agree with on a bipartisan 
basis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this resolution, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution which condemns an 
extremist group known as QAnon. 
I have to admit that I had only re-
cently heard of this group, but I didn’t 
know any of the details of their beliefs 
or tactics until this resolution was 
brought to us. But from what I have 
read, they are a delusional group that 
began with an internet post in 2017, and 
they hold the bizarre belief that the 
Federal Government is infested with 
satanic pedophiles who are busy run-
ning a global child sex trafficking ring 
when they are not plotting against 
President Trump. 
Now, I am tempted to say you can’t 
make this stuff up, but, obviously, 
somebody did make this up; and, given 
the reach of the internet, it is appar-
ently being taken seriously by some 
extremists who are turning to violence. 
Lest it get out of hand, it is appro-
priate for the House to speak with one 
voice on behalf of all of our commu-
nities across this great Nation in con-
demning QAnon and its conspiracy

theories. It should be clear to every 
man and woman of goodwill in this 
country that this group seeks only to 
further roil our society and divide our 
citizens along lines of race, religion, 
and politics. 
Even in this highly polarized polit-
ical climate, I think we can all agree 
on this. Let me ask us all to do so 
without attempting to smear any party 
or candidate with the ravings from 
this, the lunatic fringe, of our society. 
That term, ‘‘lunatic fringe,’’ was pop-
ularized by Theodore Roosevelt. He 
wrote 
this 
in 
his 
autobiography: 
‘‘Then, among the wise and high-mind-
ed people who in self-respecting and 
genuine fashion strive earnestly for 
peace, there are the foolish fanatics al-
ways to be found in such a movement 
and always discrediting it, the men 
who form the lunatic fringe in all re-
form movements.’’ 
He continued: ‘‘As I have already 
said, there is a lunatic fringe to every 
reform movement.’’ 
We have seen that borne out in the 
turbulent period of history that we 
now occupy, and how we deal with it 
will determine whether we can calm 
the political waters and restore peace 
and tranquility to our cities and civil 
discourse to our conversations. 
In that regard, it is important to 
note that QAnon and the lunatic fringe 
on the right no more speak for the 
right than antifa and the lunatic fringe 
on the left speak for the left. Both are 
poisonous to our democratic institu-
tions, and both are destructive of what 
Lincoln called the mystic chords of 
memory that should unite us as a free 
people. 
So allow me to voice my hope that 
we will see similar condemnations of 
the lunatic fringe that has been given 
free rein in recent months to rampage, 
loot, vandalize, and burn so many of 
our towns and cities across the coun-
try. 
QAnon and its allied groups are real, 
but antifa and its allied groups are also 
real. Both are direct threats to our de-
mocracy because both threaten to em-
ploy violence for political ends, and 
that is the very definition of terrorism. 
No free society can long endure if their 
acts of violence are excused, ignored, 
or tolerated. 
Lincoln said it best: There is no 
grievance that is fit object for redress 
by mob law. To that, I would add this 
observation: Without law enforcement, 
there is no law; and without law, there 
is no civilization. 
I would express the fervent hope 
that, before we adjourn, we will enter-
tain condemnations of all groups on all 
sides that employ violence for political 
ends by name. 
Wednesday night, the Rules Com-
mittee rejected a motion on a party- 
line vote that would have brought to 
the floor a resolution condemning 
antifa and its allied groups concurrent 
with this resolution. That would dem-
onstrate that this House speaks clearly 
and stands united against all such 
groups that have wrought such division 
and destruction in our communities. 
b 1015 
That is especially important when we 
survey the violence perpetrated by the 
lunatic fringe in Portland; Seattle; San 
Francisco; Oakland; Los Angeles; Chi-
cago; New York City; Washington, 
D.C.; 
Louisville, 
Kentucky; 
Min-
neapolis; and even Kenosha, Wisconsin. 
It is especially important when the 
mayors of these cities have withheld 
police protection from their own citi-
zens, leaving innocent and peaceful 
shopkeepers and residents to the mercy 
of mob law and when prosecutors have 
refused to hold accountable those who 
have perpetrated this violence upon the 
American people. 
There is precious little time before 
the election to take a stand clearly and 
unambiguously against all political vi-
olence and with one voice to stand with 
the rule of law and not with the rule of 
the mob. If we could speak together on 
this most important issue, maybe we 
could start to find our way back to 
other fundamental principles and insti-
tutions that have always united us as a 
people and made our Nation, in Lin-
coln’s words, the last best hope of man-
kind on this Earth. 
So, please, my Democratic friends, do 
not squander this fleeting opportunity 
to turn back from the perilous road we 
are on and reclaim the precious legacy 
our forefathers left us. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI), the sponsor 
of this legislation and a leader in our 
caucus. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, it is 
one of the oldest lies in the world. A 
blood libel. It always goes something 
like this: that there is a powerful, se-
cret group of people who just happen— 
many of them—to be Jewish, and they 
are trying to control the world, and, 
for good measure, kidnapping our chil-
dren. 
This is the central conspiracy theory 
that QAnon promotes today. And it 
sounds crazy—so crazy that sometimes 
we don’t take it seriously enough. But 
throughout history, conspiracy theo-
ries, just like this one, have fueled 
prejudice, terrorism, even genocide. 
And today, social media is fanning 
the flames. Their algorithms know ev-
erything about us: what we search for 
online, our biases, and they feed us 
more and more extreme versions of 
what they think we want so that we 
stay glued to our screens and see more 
ads and buy more stuff. 
That, above all, is what is causing so 
many of our fellow Americans to fear 
and hate one another. And while many 
extremist groups on the left and the 
right are recruiting followers online, 
nothing today matches the scale of 
QAnon. Nothing comes close. 
On Facebook alone, QAnon pages and 
groups have had up to 3 million mem-
bers there. There have been days this 
year when the most widely shared so-
cial media messages in the country are 
those promoted by QAnon. 
The physical threat is also real. The 
FBI, as we have heard, says that polit-
ical conspiracy theories like QAnon in-
creasingly motivate domestic extrem-
ists to commit violence. 
The Combating Terrorism Center at 
West Point says, QAnon ‘‘has dem-
onstrated its capacity to radicalize to 
violence individuals at an alarming 
speed.’’ And QAnon adherents have, in 
fact, committed numerous criminal 
and violent acts in the last 2 years. 
I think the greater threat is to our 
social fabric. QAnon is like a pill that 
immunizes you against objective re-
ality, which millions of our fellow 
Americans are taking. It destroys trust 
in government, in Democratic institu-
tions, in science, and in facts. 
Mr. Speaker, the resolution we will 
pass 
today 
categorically 
condemns 
QAnon. It has an equal number of Re-
publican and Democratic cosponsors, 
and I would thank them: Representa-
tives 
RIGGLEMAN, 
KINZINGER, 
FITZPATRICK, GOTTHEIMER and LURIA. 
Our goal is a fully bipartisan repudi-
ation of this incredibly dangerous phe-
nomenon. 
Extremist movements gain valida-
tion from the belief that they are mak-
ing inroads into the mainstream. So it 
is important to make clear we are uni-
fied against them, both parties, no 
hedging, no winks and nods. 
Now, there is just one more point I 
would make today, and that is, when 
we vote for this resolution today—and 
I am confident we will all vote for it— 
we need to mean it. 
And here is the only reference that I 
will make to partisan differences. It is 
an objective fact that this particular 
group of extremists today identifies 
with the right. There are a lot of them. 
And right now, even as we vote to con-
demn 
QAnon, 
there 
are 
political 
operatives out there putting out vile 
attacks that deliberately play to the 
paranoid fears QAnon promotes. 
Some people may rationalize this by 
pretending, Oh, QAnon, it is not that 
bad. These folks are just against sex 
trafficking, which is a real threat. Or 
they are just against the deep state, 
and hey, so is President Trump. Some 
might say there are crazy groups on 
the left, too, and that is absolutely 
true. And this resolution condemns 
them all. 
But you know what? When I criticize 
antifa, as I have, I don’t get half-a- 
dozen death threats in a day. Only one 
of these things—for now at least—is 
considered an active terrorist threat by 
the FBI. Only one is a political force. 
Only one is winning elections. 
Remember what QAnon is: It is an 
anti-Semitic, 
conspiracy-mongering 
cult that the FBI considers a potential 
terrorist threat, and it has real grow-
ing political power. 
So if you vote against fire today, 
please don’t play with fire tomorrow.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5655 
October 2, 2020 
Don’t be righteous here today and then 
go QAnon-lite on the campaign trail. 
Don’t do or say anything to fan the 
flames further. 
Mr. Speaker, America desperately 
needs to come together. Conspiracy 
theories are tearing us apart. Let us 
pass this resolution and do it over-
whelmingly and with true conviction 
so that we can say clearly, we have all 
had enough. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
RIGGLEMAN), a cosponsor of this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, be-
fore I begin today, I extend my best 
wishes 
to 
President 
Trump 
and 
Melania. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with them as they battle COVID–19. 
I also thank TOM MALINOWSKI for the 
amazing discussions that we have had 
going forward on this resolution. He is 
an amazing person to work with, and I 
thank 
him—and 
everyone 
else—for 
their work. 
Mr. Speaker, I do rise today at a piv-
otal moment in our Nation’s history 
and a moment of reckoning for our na-
tional discourse. The vitriol and anger 
spewing from both sides of the political 
aisle, echoing across the darkest cor-
ners and caverns of the internet has led 
to violence and hate, divisiveness and 
anger. 
It has all but extinguished the light 
of reasonable political discourse in this 
great country called by so many, a 
‘‘City on the Hill.’’ But we cannot con-
tinue to be this beacon of hope that we 
have been for so long if we can’t ad-
dress the issues holding us back, the 
webs that have ensnared us and the 
mistrust that has invaded our politics. 
The resolution before us today is not 
a panacea but it asks us a question 
about our purpose here in this august 
body: Will we stand up and condemn a 
dangerous, 
dehumanizing 
and 
con-
voluted conspiracy theory that the FBI 
has assessed with high confidence as 
very likely to motivate some domestic 
extremist, wholly or in part, to engage 
in criminal or violent activity? 
When my friend and colleague, Rep-
resentative MALINOWSKI, and I intro-
duced a resolution condemning the 
QAnon conspiracy theory, we knew 
that we could draw the ire of those 
that believe in fantastical theories. We 
were condemning something that is a 
danger to our political discourse. 
QAnon believers have accused me of 
running a pedophilia ring for Israel, 
being a member of the Zionist Organi-
zational Government, been called a 
traitor—accompanied by a picture of 
the gallows—and stated I was part of a 
target list. The grotesque nature of the 
tweets and Instagram posts, and the 
anti-Semitic tripe spewed by QAnon 
adherents should cause concern for ev-
eryone. Obviously, this is all ridicu-
lous, much like their theory. 
But 
the 
death 
threats 
TOM 
MALINOWSKI received were a surprise 
and a shock. This type of behavior is 
easily condemned—condemned by all of 
us here in this Chamber today. Putting 
aside the bizarre views of QAnon adher-
ents, I call on this body to condemn 
them because of their actions, actions 
that include threatening the life of my 
friend, TOM MALINOWSKI. Plotting to 
plant a bomb in the Illinois Capitol ro-
tunda to make Americans aware of the 
pizzagate conspiracy theory; the mur-
der of a man in New York in 2019, and 
other such activities. 
QAnon and the conspiracy theories it 
promotes are a danger and a threat 
that has no place in our country’s poli-
tics. I condemn this movement and 
urge all my fellow Members to join me 
in taking this step to exclude them and 
other extreme conspiracy theories from 
the national discourse. 
We talk about the First Amendment 
all the time. It is absolutely appro-
priate for the Members of this body to 
use the First Amendment to call out 
those 
that 
are 
using 
their 
First 
Amendment gift as United States citi-
zens to attack other individuals. 
This 
Nation 
has 
passed 
through 
stronger storms than this in the past, 
and we will come out stronger still. 
But it takes leadership from the top to 
stand up against extreme ideas like 
QAnon. 
I call on this House to do that today. 
Support this resolution. Pass it. I agree 
with my friend and colleague, TOM 
MALINOWSKI, that we should not be 
playing with fire. I have been in the in-
telligence business. I know the power 
of information operations and false in-
formation. Again, let’s pass this resolu-
tion. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the stages of 
deprogramming cult members is to 
point out the differences between the 
cult’s ideology and reality. And QAnon 
is a cult. In an effort to reach some of 
the people that have fallen under its 
control, I would point out a few facts. 
Mass shootings are not staged so that 
the government can come and take 
away your guns. 
John F. Kennedy, Jr., died more than 
20 years ago in a tragic aircraft acci-
dent. He is not in hiding, nor is he 
going to be President Trump’s running 
mate. 
And President Trump is not fighting 
a secret war against a Satanic, child- 
molesting network of politicians. 
It is a sad statement that discussing 
such obvious absurdities is occurring in 
this Chamber today, but the fact is, 
that some have praised QAnon and en-
couraged the growth of this cult, even 
as the FBI has labeled it a domestic 
terror threat. 
And sadly, with the support of the 
White House, and even some Members 
of Congress, QAnon has moved from 
the darkest corners of the internet into 
the mainstream of today’s political 
discourse. 
This November, there will be 22 indi-
viduals on the ballot for the House and 
the Senate who have either been en-
dorsed by or lent credence to QAnon. 
This is a threat to public safety and to 
our democracy as a whole. This move-
ment needs to be condemned and its 
followers need to be brought back to 
reality, just as we would do with any 
other cult. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Congressman MALINOWSKI, for his lead-
ership on this resolution, for the hard 
work he did to make certain that the 
condemnation of this dangerous cult is 
bipartisan. And I hope all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will 
support this resolution so we can send 
a message clearly and strongly to the 
American people that this cult is dan-
gerous for our public discourse, dan-
gerous for our democracy, and dan-
gerous for our communities. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), my good friend 
and colleague. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H. Res. 
1154 and call on all of my colleagues to 
denounce the dangerous QAnon con-
spiracy theories. 
Mr. Speaker, QAnon is a new front in 
an old war and relies on anti-Semitic 
tropes in order to spread the message. 
QAnon followers actually believe that 
the world is controlled by a secret 
cabal of child abusers, who will drink 
the blood of their victims. The FBI has 
linked the group to domestic terror 
and considers it a continuing terrorist 
threat. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
TOM 
MALINOWSKI for leading this. The kind 
of messages that he is getting—very, 
very frightening. And I also thank 
DENVER RIGGLEMAN and all of the bi-
partisan sponsors of this legislation. 
b 1030 
Just last week, my subcommittee 
held a hearing on how social media 
mainstreams 
extremism. 
When 
we 
heard from our witnesses, it was really 
terrifying. 
QAnon and other extremist groups 
have thrived for years on the internet, 
recruiting members, promoting racism, 
dividing our communities, and plotting 
actions of violence. 
As people have suffered, Big Tech has 
prospered 
and 
profited. 
Algorithms 
that amplify profits for platforms like 
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter also 
amplify extremism. 
This week, Facebook announced a 
ban on ads that support QAnon. Good, 
but it is far too little and far too late. 
Facebook users who are in QAnon-asso-
ciated groups will still be able to see 
extremist content, just further down in 
their news feeds. 
Moreover, 
Facebook 
groups 
pro-
moting anti-Semitism have grown by 
27 percent in the past week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5656 
October 2, 2020 
Congress needs to denounce right 
now this kind of hate rhetoric, and Big 
Tech must be held accountable for 
profiting on this hate. 
Before I close, I would like to also 
state my support for H. Res. 1153 and 
thank PRAMILA
JAYAPAL
for leading 
the effort and Speaker PELOSI and Ma-
jority Leader HOYER for their help on 
this resolution as well. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, a unani-
mous ‘‘yes’’ vote, on Mr. MALINOWSKI’s 
resolution. Quite frankly, I cannot be-
lieve that I have to stand on the floor 
of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives to issue these remarks. 
Every one of us here swore the very 
same oath to defend our Nation from 
enemies, both foreign and domestic. 
QAnon is a dangerous enemy, a dan-
gerous enemy lurking right within our 
borders that must be forcefully and, 
again, unanimously condemned. 
What they propagate is not real. 
Their baseless conspiracy theories, lies, 
and fearmongering are creating some-
thing, however, that is very real. And 
that is division; it is hate; and if left 
unaddressed, violence against fellow 
Americans. 
Just this week alone, my dear friend, 
Representative MALINOWSKI, has re-
ceived numerous death threats for sim-
ply condemning QAnon. Representative 
SPANBERGER, a former CIA officer, has 
been labeled a terrorist. And how could 
we forget Representatives SCALISE and 
GIFFORDS both being shot during the 
last number of years by deranged peo-
ple? 
Every one of you here knows the very 
lives of our colleagues are now at risk. 
So who is going to speak against it? 
Has hate really become a partisan 
issue? Is reality really up for debate? 
I applaud my friend, my dear friend, 
Representative RIGGLEMAN, who has 
spoken 
very 
forcefully 
and 
imme-
diately against QAnon. I know others 
are following suit. But those who don’t, 
for those who do not, what reason 
could you possibly have to remain si-
lent? 
My friends, we are all Americans, 
every single one of us. And Americans 
are looking to us right now to model 
principled, thoughtful, decent leader-
ship at this increasingly fragile time in 
our history. And history shall be our 
judge. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MOULTON). 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, in re-
sponse to September 11, President Bush 
and this Congress sent soldiers and Ma-
rines, like me, across the ocean to fight 
against extremism. The terrorists that 
we fought against used violence to ad-
vance 
their 
political 
agendas 
and 
viewed lawmakers here as their en-
emies. 
QAnon, the proud boys, the boogaloo 
boys, and other extremist groups think 
and operate in similar ways. 
But in this case, Americans do not 
have the luxury of looking across the 
ocean at this threat and just hoping 
and praying that it doesn’t come home. 
Members of these groups are Amer-
ican. Politicians have unforgivably em-
braced them. Social media platforms 
legitimize them to an unwitting public. 
Well, I have had enough. 
QAnon followers like to say, in their 
vague, ominous ramblings, that no one 
can stop what is coming. That is 
wrong. We can, and we will. 
Do not let the unforgivable main-
stream support for these groups raise 
doubts about our Nation’s resolve in 
this fight against extremism, that we 
will stop what is coming, and then we 
will build a safer, stronger America. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
thank you to the gentlewoman who is 
managing this resolution, and thank 
you very much to Mr. MALINOWSKI for 
bringing us together. 
I think I started out earlier this 
morning by saying the Nation is better 
than this. It is not because people do 
not have the right to espouse views 
that I may disagree with. But not when 
those views become detrimental to in-
nocent Americans; when those views 
take the very hostile and historically 
violent form of anti-Semitism; when 
they begin to attack and marginalize 
groups; when they evidence themselves 
as we saw—although not claiming to be 
part of QAnon—that scene in Char-
lottesville, with tiki torches, saying 
that part of the Nation did not belong 
here, in essence threatening people of 
color, Jewish people. 
I believe this resolution is crucial. It 
is crucial because it is dangerous to re-
main silent. As we have looked at 
QAnon, it is attempting to speak of 
fringe beliefs that can be enormously 
dangerous. It can actually motivate do-
mestic extremists, which may result in 
harm to innocent persons. 
The FBI has made an assessment, 
with high confidence, that the fringe 
political conspiracy theories, including 
QAnon, are motivating domestic ex-
tremists, and where QAnon adherents 
have been implicated in one particular 
case of a man arrested in 2018 for plot-
ting to plant a bomb in the Illinois 
Capitol rotunda to make Americans 
aware of pizzagate. 
I think we are also aware of, during 
the last Presidential election, someone 
driving and rushing to a restaurant in 
Washington, D.C., and going in the 
basement, suggesting that pedophiles 
and the then-Presidential candidate 
were involved in it. 
These are dangerous positions. They 
are not just that I disagree because a 
philosophy is different from SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE. It is that we must not be 
silent, for there have been atrocities 
perpetrated around the world histori-
cally because people remained silent. 
The atrocities in Germany come to 
mind; we remained silent. Or the geno-
cide in Sudan; we remained silent. 
So this resolution is crucial. It is as 
crucial as the work we will do in ad-
dressing the sin, the original sin, of 
this Nation, and that was slavery. 
But I rise today to support H. Res. 
1154 that condemns QAnon and rejects 
conspiracy theories. I ask my col-
leagues to support this. And I thank 
the author of this legislation for his 
courage and leadership. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. I 
will close as I began. 
Extremist groups on the right and 
the left that advocate violence as a 
method of achieving political goals 
threaten the very foundations of our 
democracy, and I fully support this res-
olution in its denunciation of one such 
group called QAnon. 
But the American people can see 
with their own eyes where the violence 
on our streets is coming from, and I 
deeply regret that the majority is not 
willing to call out by name such groups 
as antifa or to acknowledge that such 
evil forces even exist. We must speak 
out together against all such groups, 
and I am deeply troubled that, for some 
reason, we cannot. 
We need to know who is funding 
these groups. We can already see with 
our own eyes who is encouraging them. 
We can see with our own eyes whose 
mayors have deliberately withheld po-
lice protection from their citizens as 
these extremist-driven mobs run ramp-
ant in our communities. 
We can see with our own eyes those 
politicians calling for defunding police 
departments that are the only means 
of defense that our citizens have. 
We can see with our own eyes those 
prosecutors who have refused to hold 
accountable those who perpetrate vio-
lence in our communities and who in-
stead prosecute citizens who are des-
perately trying to defend themselves. 
So, I am pleased to support this reso-
lution, but it is no substitute for a 
clear and unambiguous stand against 
all political extremism and violence 
that this House, for some reason, re-
fuses to take. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. Let me 
start by thanking Mr. MALINOWSKI and 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN for this bipartisan reso-
lution, such an important statement. 
And I do hope all of my colleagues in 
this Chamber vote for the resolution. I 
am troubled that some might try to 
take this bipartisan resolution and in-
troduce other aspects that include call-
ing out cities like mine, the city of Se-
attle, and other baseless comments. 
But the most important thing is to 
return to the context of this resolu-
tion. The context is that it is sad that, 
in the year 2020, a baseless, anti-Se-
mitic conspiracy theory has infected

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5657 
October 2, 2020 
the political discourse of our great de-
mocracy. 
This body should not be giving such 
an unhinged internet hoax the time of 
day. Frankly, it is sad that in the past 
few weeks, the House has had to pass 
several resolutions, including a resolu-
tion calling for a peaceful transfer of 
power after this year’s Presidential 
election, to publicly reinforce demo-
cratic customs and norms that until 
recently were beyond question. But cir-
cumstances, yet again, require this 
body to make a statement. 
Through social media, this internet 
hoax has become so widespread that it 
has inspired threats and even acts of 
violence across the country, including 
against our Members on both sides of 
the aisle. Unfortunately, rather than 
condemn 
this 
hoax, 
rhetoric 
that 
comes from the White House has in-
stead given comfort to QAnon followers 
and credence to their belief in fab-
ricated and fantastical theories. 
Under these circumstances, it is so 
good to be doing a bipartisan resolu-
tion in this House. It is imperative 
that the House of Representatives 
make it clear to the American people 
that QAnon is a hoax and that we abso-
lutely and completely condemn the vi-
olence perpetrated by its adherence. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong 
support of H. Res. 1154, a resolution con-
demning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy 
theories it promotes. 
QAnon is a movement promoting a collec-
tion of unfounded conspiracy theories that 
have spread widely on the internet since 2017. 
Whereas, throughout history, conspiracy 
theories that falsely blame secret cabals or 
marginalized groups for society’s ills have 
fueled prejudice, genocide, and acts of ter-
rorism. 
QAnon first gained notoriety with its un-
founded, outrageous, and bizarre conspiracy 
theory alleging that prominent Americans are 
engaged in a secret plot to control the world, 
while using their power to exploit children. 
Qanon has gone on to embrace virtually 
every popular conspiracy theory of the last 
several decades, from questioning the truth 
about the September 11th terrorist attacks, to 
believing in alien landings, to denying the 
safety of vaccines. 
Many QAnon followers express anti-Semitic 
views, and the Anti-Defamation League has 
said that the movement’s central conspiracy 
theory includes anti-Semitic elements; 
Mr. Speaker, history records that conspiracy 
theories have been a central driver of anti- 
Semitism for centuries, and QAnon conspiracy 
theories are fanning the flames as anti-Semi-
tism is on the rise in the United States and 
around the world. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
has assessed with high confidence that ‘‘fringe 
political 
conspiracy 
theories’’, 
including 
QAnon, ‘‘very likely motivate some domestic 
extremists, wholly or in part, to engage in 
criminal or violent activity’’, and that these 
conspiracy theories ‘‘very likely encourage the 
targeting of specific people, places and organi-
zations, thereby increasing the likelihood of vi-
olence against these targets.’’ 
This assessment is supported by an alarm-
ing number of ‘‘events in which individuals 
committed crimes, plotted attacks, or success-
fully carried out deadly violence, and who—ei-
ther before or after their arrests—attributed 
their actions to their conspiratorial beliefs.’’ 
For example, QAnon adherents have been 
implicated in crimes that they claim their 
QAnon beliefs inspired, including— 
1. A man arrested in 2018 for plotting to 
plant a bomb in the Illinois Capitol rotunda to 
make Americans aware of the ‘‘Pizzagate’’ 
conspiracy theory; 
2. A man arrested in 2018 for using an ar-
mored car to block traffic on the Hoover Dam 
Bypass Bridge; 
3. A man in Arizona arrested in 2019 for 
vandalizing a Catholic church; and 
4. A woman arrested in New York with a car 
full of knives after posting a video accusing 
Joe Biden of participating in child sex traf-
ficking and threatening to kill him. 
According to the Combating Terrorism Cen-
ter at the United States Military Academy at 
West Point, ‘‘QAnon is arguably no longer 
simply a fringe conspiracy theory but an ide-
ology that has demonstrated its capacity to 
radicalize to violence individuals at an alarm-
ing speed.’’ 
The 
conspiracy 
theories 
promoted 
by 
QAnon undermine trust in America’s demo-
cratic institutions, encourage rejection of ob-
jective reality, and further deepen our Nation’s 
political polarization. 
It is therefore timely and appropriate that the 
People’s House support this resolution, which 
puts it on record clearly condemning QAnon 
and rejecting the false conspiracy theories it 
promotes and spread. 
In the highly charged political climate we 
find ourselves in it is also appropriate that this 
body condemns any and all other groups and 
ideologies, from the far left to the far right, that 
contribute to the spread of unfounded con-
spiracy theories or that encourage Americans 
to destroy public and private property and at-
tack lawful authority. 
Mr. Speaker, in addition to condemning 
QAnon and its false and dangerous con-
spiracy theories, I support the resolution be-
cause it calls upon the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation, as well as all Federal law enforce-
ment and homeland security agencies, to con-
tinue strengthening their focus on preventing 
violence, threats, harassment, and other crimi-
nal activity by extremists motivated by fringe 
political conspiracy theories and urges all 
Americans, regardless of our beliefs or par-
tisan affiliation, to seek information from au-
thoritative sources and to engage in political 
debate from a common factual foundation.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
discuss where we are now and where I 
expect to be in the coming hours and 
days. 
First of all, I would caution all of us. 
We had a procedure in place where we 
would come on the floor in relatively 
small numbers and exit the floor. 
Our President and the First Lady 
have been found to be afflicted with 
COVID–19. We pray for their health and 
their safety. 
But we ought to also admonish our-
selves to practice that distancing and 
that wearing a mask. We don’t wear 
them when we are speaking so people 
can hear us, but I would urge all of us 
to understand that, obviously, COVID– 
19 is still very much among us. And for 
all of our sakes, and for the people’s 
sake who we represent who want us to 
be healthy and articulate their posi-
tion when we come to the floor, that 
we would be cautious. 
Secondly, let me say, Mr. Speaker, 
that we have not, sadly, come to either 
a legislative agreement or an agree-
ment between the administration and 
ourselves on a resolution of the next 
steps to take dealing with the COVID 
health crisis and the economic con-
sequences of that crisis. 
I want to tell Members that it is my 
expectation that this will be after this 
coming vote, which will be the last 
vote of today. There may well be, in 
discussions with our both sides, unani-
mous consent requests, but obviously 
they will have to be unanimous con-
sent requests, and they will be agree-
ments between both sides. 
In addition to that, we will not be 
leaving for the break that usually oc-
curs in October for the election that is 
about to come because, obviously, all 
of us want the opportunity to be talk-
ing to our constituents, but we also 
have a responsibility to ensure that 
our constituents are safe and get the 
help that they need. 
So we are negotiating, and negotia-
tions are going on as we speak between 
the administration and between our 
side of the aisle both here and across 
the Capitol. Hopefully, those negotia-
tions will bear fruit sooner rather than 
later. When I say ‘‘sooner rather than 
later,’’ I hope that this weekend per-
haps an agreement can be reached. 
Now, if an agreement is reached, it 
will take some time to memorialize 
that agreement on paper. So I do not 
necessarily expect that a Monday or 
Tuesday vote is likely, but I want ev-
erybody to know, and it will be 24 
hours’ notice. It will not be 36 and it 
will not be 48 hours. I know that is dif-
ficult, but I think all of us feel, on both 
sides of the aisle, an urgency. 
Clearly, for tactical reasons, we go 
back and forth and try to get an advan-
tage on one another. That is what both 
sides do. I will tell you as sincerely as 
I can tell you, I know that the Speak-
er, who is negotiating with Secretary 
Mnuchin, I believe both of them are ne-
gotiating in goodwill, and both of them 
very much want to get to an agree-
ment. 
I know how hard our Speaker has 
been working and I know how hard 
Secretary Mnuchin has been working 
because I know, when they meet with 
one another and when they talk with 
one another on the phone, I almost in-
variably get a call from the Speaker, 
saying: This is what happens. This is 
where we are. 
So I want to advise all of you that, 
while this vote that is to come is going 
to be our last vote of the day—and I 
don’t expect even if an agreement were 
reached in the next hour that we would 
be able to bring something to the floor. 
So after this next vote, Members are 
free to go where they want to go. Just 
be aware that there will be very 
short—no shorter than 24 hours’—no-
tice so that we can come back and try 
to do what the American people want 
us to do, notwithstanding the fact we 
have 
different 
perspectives 
exactly 
what that is. 
I hope that all of us will be focused 
and will be thinking about what we 
think is a reasonable agreement that 
we will reach, and hopefully whatever 
agreement is reached will be perceived 
by both sides as something that we can 
vote for. 
Obviously, it won’t have everything 
in it that each person wants or maybe 
has something that each person or 
some people may not want, but we 
have come together four times, Mr. 
Speaker. One was by unanimous con-
sent. There was no vote. It passed by 
voice vote. I don’t know if everybody 
was for, it but at least nobody said 
‘‘no.’’ The other three were overwhelm-
ingly passed and, in the Senate, I think 
at least twice, by voice vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5659 
October 2, 2020 
So that, Mr. Speaker, is where we are 
at this point in time. I may make an-
other announcement 45 minutes from 
now just to let other Members know. 
I hope Members are watching, and 
certainly we will send it out, but Mem-
bers need to check flights, obviously. 
My staff member tells me. I presume 
all of you understand that you have to 
check which flights are available. Obvi-
ously, that is a challenge. One of the 
things that we need to deal with is, ob-
viously, the airlines. We need to deal 
with a lot of other things as well, and 
we will try to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Mr. BURGESS changed his vote from 
‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay’’. 
So the resolution was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
Stated for: 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on 
October 2, 2020, I voted incorrectly on Roll 
no. 218, on agreeing to the resolution H. Res. 
1154, ‘‘Condeming QAnon and rejecting the 
conspiracy theory it promotes.’’ The record 
should reflect that my intended vote on this 
roll call should have been ‘‘aye,’’ in favor of 
passage of the resolution. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I am not re-
corded due to a family member’s memorial 
service. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 217 and ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 218. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I was not present 
the week of Sept. 28 to Oct. 2, 2020 on ac-
count of supporting my son’s continuing recov-
ery. Had I been present, I would have voted 
‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 217 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall 
No. 218. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I was not present 
for rollcall vote No. 217 on Agreeing to the 
Resolution (H. Res. 1153) condemning un-
wanted, unnecessary medical procedures on 
individuals without their full, informed consent. 
Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I was not present for rollcall 
vote No. 218 on Agreeing to the Resolution 
(H. Res. 1154) condemning QAnon and reject-
ing the conspiracy theories it promotes. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ‘‘yes.’’

RECOGNIZING CREW OF THE 
MIGHTY IKE 
(Mr. COURTNEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to salute the extraordinary 
efforts of the officers and crew of the 
USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier 
Strike Group. 
These dedicated sailors deployed in 
late January, navigating over 60,000 
nautical miles from Norfolk, Virginia, 
to the Arabian Sea, conducting 166 sor-
ties and 1,135 flight hours in support of 
Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in the 
Arabian Sea. 
This group deserves special recogni-
tion for their successful deployment in 
which COVID–19 restrictions presented 
the traditional port visits. 
Upon returning to homeport on Au-
gust 10, the crew of the Mighty Ike was 
underway for an astounding 206 con-
secutive days. 
To the officers and crew, including 
two constituents from eastern Con-
necticut, Petty Officer Ashley Maratta 
of Amston and Lieutenant Charles

Peck of Old Lyme, an aviator on his

PRAYER FOR THE PRESIDENT 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Speaker and the leadership 
for asking me, as the chairman of the 
House Congressional Prayer Caucus, to 
lead the House in prayer for our Presi-
dent. 
I would ask the Members to join me. 
Father, I thank You that You are a 
God that hears and answers prayers. 
And, God, You aren’t partisan. And 
today, we have been shocked with the 
word that our President and First 
Lady, Melania, have tested positive 
with COVID. 
You know and You care. God, I would 
pray that we would unite together at 
least in this today, as a country and as 
a body, to pray for our President, even 
as Your Scriptures instruct us to pray 
for those in authority. 
We pray that You would spare them, 
that You would heal them, even as we 
pray for many, many, many others in 
our country and around the world who 
have been caught with this virus. But, 
in turn, I pray as well that You would 
tenderize our hearts, that You would 
unify our country, even with this being 
brought on today. 
And I pray that our President would 
understand and take on the words of 
Psalm 16:1, words that meant much to 
George Washington, our first Presi-
dent, that said: Preserve me, O God, for 
I take refuge in You. 
God, may we take refuge in You, 
even as our President, and may You 
heal our land as You heal him. 
It is in the name of Jesus, my Savior, 
I pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING RETIREMENT OF 
BLAKE HURST 
(Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to commemorate and thank Blake 
Hurst for his service to the Missouri 
Farm Bureau and to Missouri’s agri-
culture community. 
Blake is a well-respected gentleman 
throughout the State of Missouri, not 
just in my home district, the Fifth. He 
is well known in the ag community, 
serving as president of the Missouri 
Farm Bureau since 2010 and vice presi-
dent and district board member before 
that. 
I can attest to Blake’s kindness and 
open-mindedness 
because 
he 
has 
worked with this urban representative 
from Kansas City. For 10 years, Blake 
has reached out to develop a relation-
ship and partnership as we work to-
gether to do things for our district. 
He understands the symbiosis that 
exists between rural areas and urban 
ones. He knows the importance of mak-
ing sure that all families can put food 
on their tables. 
I wish Blake well on his retirement 
as president of the Missouri Farm Bu-
reau, but I know that as a farmer, he 
will keep busy with his family farm in 
northwest Missouri and their wholesale 
greenhouse business.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ADELINE 
FAGAN 
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Adeline 
Fagan, who passed away on September 
19, 2020, at the young age of 28, fol-
lowing 
a 
courageous 
battle 
with 
COVID–19. 
Growing up in central New York, Dr. 
Fagan always knew she wanted to 
practice medicine, and she was always 
helping people. That was her passion. 
She was a standout student at Bishop 
Ludden High School, my alma mater, 
and at St. Joseph’s and the University 
of Buffalo. 
She traveled to Haiti four times on 
missions to serve those who lived in 
areas where access to healthcare was 
limited. 
Dr. Fagan later moved to Houston, 
Texas, to complete a residency as an 
OB/GYN doctor, working rotations in 
the emergency room where she was 
routinely exposed to COVID–19 pa-
tients. 
Tragically, Dr. Fagan fell ill with 
COVID–19 and passed away last month. 
Members of our community have come 
together to remember her life and tre-
mendous work as a daughter, sister, 
friend, and healthcare provider. And it 
is my honor to do so before this body 
now. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in hon-
oring the life of Dr. Fagan, a true hero, 
and all those who continue their serv-
ice among these challenges.

HONORING JUSTICE RUTH BADER 
GINSBURG 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when the news of Justice Ginsburg’s 
passing broke, the first text I received 
was from my daughter, quickly fol-
lowed by messages from female friends 
and family from every phase of my life. 
The immediate outpouring of tributes 
was a natural and authentic testament 
to the Justice’s outsized impact on 
American women over the last half 
century. 
Justice Ginsburg carried the torch 
for us for justice, for women’s rights, 
and, even as tiny and soft-spoken as 
she was, as a voice for the voiceless. 
She broke barriers; she changed the 
status quo; and she never stopped push-
ing our country to become a more per-
fect Union. 
In so doing, she became a source of 
intergenerational inspiration and a pop 
culture icon. But that intergenera-
tional 
inspiration 
was 
a 
two-way 
street. I am reminded of one of the last 
times I heard her speak. 
After making her remarks, a college 
student asked the Justice: What gives 
you hope? 
The Justice said: What gives me hope 
is the number of women running for of-
fice and the activism of younger gen-
erations, because from what I have 
seen, they will be the ones to effect 
change. 
We must have the courage to pass on 
a better nation to our children and our 
grandchildren. 
Justice 
Ginsburg’s 
words are a reminder, as we serve the 
people’s House, as we manage this chal-
lenging time, as we prepare to vote in 
this election, that what each of us does 
matters and what we don’t do matters. 
May we never stop learning from Jus-
tice Ginsburg, and may her memory be 
a blessing to our country.

RECOGNIZING BREAST CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the beginning of 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
One in eight women will develop 
breast cancer in her lifetime. Other 
than skin cancer, this is the most com-
mon cancer among American women. 
Over 42,000 of affected women are ex-
pected to die in 2020 in the United 
States alone. 
Rates have been declining since 2007, 
but there is more to be done to make 
sure they continue to decrease. 
As our Nation battles COVID–19, 
many people have delayed their annual 
doctor’s appointments. For women, de-
layed screening, most of all, can be 
dangerous 
if 
breast 
cancer 
goes 
undiagnosed. Early detection is key for 
those affected by the disease. 
As a husband and a father to three 
girls, raising awareness for breast can-
cer 
and 
encouraging 
them 
to 
be 
proactive with their health is of the ut-
most importance.

October 2, 2020 
HONORING ROD LINDSAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to memorialize and remem-
ber a friend that I first got to know 
when I got into the elective office 
realm. His name is Rod Lindsay, a gen-
tleman from Shasta County. 
Early on, when I was a brand-new 
legislator and I didn’t know a lot of 
people in other parts of our vast dis-
trict that we have in rural northern 
California, it could be a little intimi-
dating to get out and learn these new 
places and meet new people. And so for 
that brand-new legislator, this man 
here was one that embraced me fairly 
early on and wanted me to be success-
ful in that interaction that we had. 
Mr. Rod Lindsay was many things, 
but during our overlap of time, he was 
mayor of Shasta Lake and I was a 
board member of Shasta Lake for sev-
eral terms. More than that, he was a 
community 
leader 
that 
everybody 
knew and gravitated towards. 
Rod’s heritage goes back as a mem-
ber of the Miwok Nation Tribe in more 
central California. Northern California 
is very rich and steeped in Native 
American culture and history. 
Rod was one to always help make 
sure that that culture was part of the 
proceedings, part of what was going on 
in our communities for different com-
munity events. Rod would lead prayer. 
Rod would lead dance. Rod would lead 
in many ways that helped make sure 
the culture of northern California had 
diversity. 
We lost Rod recently, on August 27, 
after many years of service and many 
years of leading. I always thought of 
Rod as kind of everybody’s elder, as 
kind of a Tribal elder for everybody in 
that Shasta Lake area. 
Rod did so much to help his commu-
nity as an elected official, but also as 
an advocate for education, advocating 
for children for over 40 years, including 
as an executive director of a group 
known as LIFE, which is Local Indians 
For Education. He served on that until 
he passed away. 
Rod was a friend to many, a friend to 
me, a leader who just cared so much 
about his community, his friends, his 
neighbors, his family, and making 
things right for Tribes in northern 
California, as well. 
You don’t get many people like this 
in your lifetime in your path that you 
cross, but I was proud to have walked 
that path and common ground with 
Rod Lindsay. 
I appreciate the time to be able to 
commemorate him here and acknowl-
edge him. Indeed, a beautiful ceremony 
was had for him in his community just 
a few days ago, with a great outpouring 
of love and of shared stories and par-
ticipation by local Tribes in northern 
California to have that heritage cele-
brated, as well. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
time that I was able to share with you 
about him here today. 
HONORING BRUCE SESSIONS 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate a man who 
was known as a voice in not only Butte 
County, where he had lived previously, 
but a voice of mainstream media, he 
called himself, Bruce Sessions. This 
was a surprise to me. I just got word of 
his passing last night. 
Anybody in Butte County who listens 
to the radio knows who he is. Bruce 
spent many years on KRIJ radio, 
broadcasting from Paradise, California, 
and then he was a news director at 
KNVR in Chico. But finally, he was 
hired, where he really came into his 
own, on KPAY radio, in 1991, as a talk 
show host. 
All those afternoons Bruce hosted 
the KPAY Liveline. For 10 years, he 
hosted that show, a 3-hour show each 
afternoon. And for me, way before I got 
into the political realm, I was listening 
to it out in the fields as I drove the 
tractor and helped plant a crop or har-
vest a crop or irrigate in between. 
Bruce was the voice of the Liveline 
all those afternoons bringing largely 
conservative radio content to all of us 
in a several-county area there, and 
doing it with a lot of fun and doing it 
with a lot of humor—and a lot of self- 
deprecation, too. 
Bruce was quite humorous, but also 
very pointed and very direct, too. When 
I finally became an elected official, you 
would find yourself on the end of: ‘‘Are 
you doing it right? Are you doing what 
you said you would do?’’ So I appre-
ciate that about him. 
Before being in Butte County, before 
moving to Magalia, California, Bruce 
spent 8 years as a reporter for radio 
stations down in the Las Vegas area. I 
can see Bruce fitting in pretty good 
down in Las Vegas, as well. 
Bruce Sessions, indeed, was a treas-
ure for our area, and I always enjoyed 
him at community events and political 
events, where he would bring that wry 
humor and his Navy humor, because he 
did spend many years in the U.S. Navy. 
One of Bruce’s sayings as he signed 
off was, ‘‘Always keep a zero bubble,’’ 
keep yourself level. 
So, when Bruce finally retired from 
doing the talk show host every day for 
those 3 hours, he backed off a little bit, 
but decided to still keep his fingers on 
the pulse, so he would have a twice- 
daily feature on KPAY radio called 
‘‘Tidbits from the B.S. Notebook,’’ 
being his initials. But there you get 
that wry humor again because that 
might have a double meaning. Bruce 
would talk about the news events of 
the day in that format and just still 
keep that voice out there, keep that 
lively way of looking at things for 
those listeners in Butte County. 
I always enjoyed Bruce and his com-
mentary and his discussion on the 
radio. It kind of helped me to under-
stand things about life and about poli-
tics, as well, from a guy who had been 
around the block and was paying atten-
tion to a lot of things while I was pay-
ing attention to farming. 
Madam Speaker, I will miss Bruce. I 
thank him for his service. 
To his family, to those who go on, we 
all appreciated Bruce in Butte County, 
by and large. Maybe not so much on 
the other side of the political spec-
trum, but that is okay. We accept 
Bruce for who he was. But I enjoyed 
Bruce, and I am grateful to have been 
a friend and a listener for those many 
years in Butte County. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
GET WELL SOON PRESIDENT 
TRUMP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, before I get to H. Res. 1168, I would 
like to say just a few words about a 
very pressing issue in my mind. 
I was approached just recently by a 
reporter who was very nice and very 
kind to me, and she wanted my state-
ments about the President and his cur-
rent circumstance. I did give her my 
commentary, but I would also like to 
indicate that, in her request, she was a 
little bit concerned as to whether or 
not people across the aisle from the 
President would find some degree of 
comfort in making statements about 
his condition. 
Well, here is what I believe: I believe 
that in times such as these, I believe 
that, when a person is ill, we have to 
put politics aside. I believe that we 
should respect the humanity of every 
person. 
I have a deep abiding affinity for 
every person’s humanity, and I ex-
plained to her that I have said a prayer 
for the President as early as this morn-
ing. I especially mentioned the Presi-
dent, the First Lady, and Ms. Hicks. 
I am saddened by what has happened, 
to be quite candid with you. I wish no 
person this illness. This virus is vi-
cious, and my prayer is that the Presi-
dent will get well soon. 
I also mentioned that there was one 
bit of good news as it relates to the 
President, and it was that his son does 
not have this virus. I don’t think that 
that is the ultimate in good news. We 
want 
everybody 
to 
recover—every-
body—not just the President, the First 
Lady, and Ms. Hicks. We want every-
body to recover. 
I know how my mother loved me, and 
my mother would have assumed every 
illness that I had if she could have. She 
loved me to the extent that she made 
great sacrifices for me. So I would hope 
and I believe that the President and 
the First Lady had some degree and 
comfort in knowing that their son does 
not have this virus. 
I would hope that every person in 
this country will get proper treatment

and every person will walk away from 
this virus and that our country will be 
able to say that we were able to unite 
and overcome the virus. 
b 1300 
My final comment to the reporter 
was I do want to see the President get 
well soon and my prayer is that we can 
unite against this virus. There are 
many other things that we can unite 
around, too, and should unite around, 
but this virus is vicious, and my hope 
is that our country will unite against 
the virus. 
NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS 
MONTH 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, having said this, I now rise. And 
still I rise. 
Today, in the name of liberty and 
justice for all, I rise. And I rise to 
present H. Res. 1168, the original Na-
tional Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month resolution, and I have this Spe-
cial Order time to speak to the world, 
if you will, by and through this micro-
phone, which takes the message far and 
wide, about domestic violence. 
I rise today in support of those who 
have endured, and many continue to 
endure, domestic violence across our 
country. 
People are suffering from the pan-
demic, and those who are suffering 
from the pandemic and they have got 
domestic violence to deal with, they 
are suffering in some ways that I prob-
ably cannot understand. 
But because they are suffering, those 
of us who have it within our power to 
do something about those who suffer, I 
believe we must do it. 
I believe that too often, those who 
suffer have to depend upon those who 
are comfortable to get their relief. Suf-
fering should not be dependent upon 
those who decide that, ‘‘That is not my 
problem.’’ 
We all have to assume that domestic 
violence is our problem, because do-
mestic violence does not discriminate. 
It is like the virus, in a sense, the 
coronavirus. It is not just something 
that is endemic to Democrats or Re-
publicans or Independents. It doesn’t 
recognize party lines. 
People who engage in this activity 
come from all walks of life. It doesn’t 
matter whether you are rich or poor: 
domestic violence can be a part of your 
life. And it has been a part of the lives 
of people who have been very wealthy, 
very poor, and in between. 
It doesn’t matter where you come 
from. It can be something that is, un-
fortunately, imposed upon you. 
And domestic violence, while it is 
something that happens to women 
much more often than men, it does 
happen to men as well. 
It happens to all persons regardless 
of race, creed, color, national origin, 
regardless of your sexuality, and it has 
especially been a problem for women 
who are trans. It has been a serious 
problem. Lives have been lost. 
So I rise today in support of all who 
would support efforts to end domestic 
violence. 
I am not a person who wants to see 
things simply get better. I think ‘‘bet-
ter’’ is something that we acquire be-
fore we get to the end, but that is not 
the end. We are not looking to just 
make it better. We want to end domes-
tic violence. 
I rise today with this bipartisan reso-
lution. It is important to say this, that 
it is bipartisan. Members across the 
aisle feel as strongly about domestic 
violence as Members on this side of the 
aisle. 
The bipartisan resolution has the 
support of 21 additional Members of 
Congress. And my guess is we would 
have more than this 21 if not but for 
the fact that we had to drop the resolu-
tion on the 1st of the month, this is Do-
mestic Violence Awareness Month, and 
people are doing so many different 
things now and are leaving town, so 
they didn’t get a chance to really re-
view it so that they could sign onto it. 
I do believe that there would be many 
more Members. 
But for those who have signed on, I 
think it appropriate to let the world 
know that they are part of this and 
that there is an anticipation that there 
will be others to join us in this bipar-
tisan resolution. 
The resolution is cosponsored by 
Representative ANN
WAGNER, a very 
dear friend. She and I have worked on 
many things together. Representative 
RICK
LARSEN, another friend. All of 
these persons are persons that I have

Madam Speaker, I want to thank all 
of them for joining us for this move-
ment, to be a part of this movement to 
end domestic violence. 
October 1 was first declared as Na-
tional Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month 31 years ago in 1989. Since then, 
October has been a time to acknowl-
edge domestic violence survivors and 
to be a voice for those who have been 
victimized by domestic violence. 
Domestic violence is prevalent in 
every community and affects all people 
regardless of age, socioeconomic sta-
tus, sexual orientation, gender, race, 
religion, or national origin. I realize 
that I just repeated myself, but some 
things bear repeating. These are such 
things. 
Physical violence is often accom-
panied by emotional abuse and control-
ling behavior as part of a much larger 
systemic pattern of dominance and 
control. 
The people that I talk to, who are 
supposed to understand this much bet-
ter than I, make it very clear to me 
that this is about control, about domi-
nance; not always, but to the extent 
that we can generalize and say that 
this is what it is about, it is about con-
trol and dominance, one person want-
ing to dictate to another person, to the 
extent that if the person doesn’t com-
ply, there are consequences. 
We cannot live in a world where per-
sons are allowed to impose their will 
on other people simply because they 
have the power to do so, they are phys-
ically capable of doing so, they are 
mentally situated such that they can 
do so. We can’t allow it. 
Domestic violence is devastating, and 
the consequences of domestic violence 
can cross generations and last a life-
time. 
Crossing generations can occur when 
a child lives in a home where domestic 
violence is prevalent. Children learn 
from their parents; they learn from the 
behavior of their parents. The behavior 
of parents is something that children 
will accept, but they will also attempt 
to replicate it. The replication of it 
takes it across generations. 
We cannot accept the notion that our 
children, when they are in their forma-
tive years, will be allowed to see par-
ents as this kind of conduct is exhib-
ited and then adopt it, and when they 
grow up, unfortunately, some of them 
will take on the ugly habits and behav-
ior of their parents. 
Women are disproportionately vic-
tims of domestic violence, as one in 
four women and one in seven men ages 
18 and older will experience domestic 
violence at some point in their life. It 
is a very disheartening statement. 
On average, more than three women 
are murdered by their husbands or boy-
friends in the United States every day. 
This is something that bears repeating. 
On average, more than three women 
are murdered by their husbands or boy-
friends in the United States every day. 
This ought to shock the conscience of 
the 
Nation. 
This 
is 
unacceptable. 
Awareness is important, but we have 
got to do more than simply make peo-
ple aware. 
I will say more about this, as I have 
now a colleague who has joined me, and 
I am honored to introduce him. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
O’HALLERAN), my friend from Arizona’s 
First District. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN is from the great 
State of Arizona. He represents Ari-
zona 1. But something more important 
ought to be said: He is from across the 
aisle. This is the demonstration of bi-
partisanship that I spoke of earlier, 
and I want to thank him and commend 
him for what he is doing to help us end 
domestic violence. 
As he moves to the microphone, my 
hope is that those who have not had

the opportunity to be here today will 
have the opportunity to say more in 
the future. This is one of the times 
when too much said about this will not 
be enough. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GREEN) for hosting this important Spe-
cial Order hour. 
I did used to be a Republican. I am no 
longer. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize October as Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month. 
As a former law enforcement officer, 
some of the very first calls I responded 
to involved domestic violence. I have 
seen firsthand the damage this unique-
ly hideous kind of violence can do to 
families and survivors. 
When you come to a situation like 
this and you look around the room, you 
can see it in the children’s eyes, the 
fear that they have; you can see a fam-
ily in turmoil; you can clearly identify 
the tension that is in the room; and too 
many times, sadly, you can also iden-
tify the damage that has been done 
through violence in that same room. 
As a member of the Bipartisan Task 
Force to End Sexual Violence, I am 
proud to cosponsor and recognize the 
month of October as Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month. 
Together, as one body, we must com-
mit to working to secure justice for 
survivors both in and out of the court-
room. The courtroom is an important 
aspect, but it is not the only aspect of 
this. It is important and we have to get 
there. 
If we can resolve these issues before 
that by having appropriate help for 
that family, appropriate services for 
that family, the process of identifying 
the underlying causes that occurred in 
that family, then hopefully courtrooms 
will not have to be used. 
This Congress, I reintroduced my 
Help End Abusive Living Situations, or 
HEALS, Act legislation to assist the 
survivors of domestic violence to rap-
idly secure safe housing situations. 
No person experiencing domestic vio-
lence should be forced to stay in a dan-
gerous situation because they do not 
have housing elsewhere. 
It is great to have family, but many 
of our victims don’t have family near-
by. We need to make sure that our vic-
tims are able to seek safety. 
In Arizona, when I was in the legisla-
ture, there was a shortage of domestic 
violence facilities to be able to house 
families. We overcame some of that, 
but it is still true today, and it is true 
in Arizona and many other States 
across this land. We must be able to 
stop that. 
b 1315 
Mr. GREEN
clearly identified the 
amount of terrible and tragic deaths 
that occur every day. It also tears 
apart families. We need to help mend 
those families back to where they need 
to be in order to make sure that those 
children may have the potential to 
have a normal life. But if not that, we 
have to provide the necessary help. 
As the Representative of Arizona’s 
First Congressional District, I am 
humbled to represent 12 sovereign Trib-
al nations. Federal data indicates that 
55 percent of American Indian and 
Alaska Native women have experienced 
physical violence by their intimate 
partners. 
I know for a fact that on many Tribal 
nations, help may not arrive for hours. 
On the Navajo reservation, in the last 
few years, three officers have died, not 
by answering a call for a bank robbery, 
or the fact that they have to go and ad-
dress a burglary issue or help some-
body else. They died because they had 
to be alone going there because there 
are no other police nearby. And they 
are dead today because of that, and 
their families are suffering still. 
I joined my colleagues to introduce 
the SURVIVE Act, a bill that would 
provide legal, medical, and counseling 
resources to women and children in 
Tribal communities who are survivors 
of domestic violence. It would also help 
those officers who have to respond to 
that scene and also the children of that 
family. 
Let’s use Navajo as an example. Nav-
ajo is the size of West Virginia. It 
takes in parts of New Mexico, Arizona, 
and Utah. Most of it is in Arizona. 
There are only about 220 officers for 3 
shifts, sick leave, and everything else, 
to respond to domestic violence in 
areas far away from many of the towns 
nearby. 
To those experiencing domestic vio-
lence, and those who have lost a loved 
one to this hideous and deeply personal 
form of violence, I know that we can-
not pretend to understand your pain, 
but we will keep fighting for change at 
every level. 
Another example, I had the sad re-
sponsibility to be a homicide investi-
gator for 6 years. Many, many of those 
cases involved domestic violence. I also 
investigated the aftereffects of domes-
tic violence without death. 
I can tell you, because I followed 
those families through court, time and 
time again, saw them year after year, 
the changes that occurred within that 
family because of the death of a loved 
one, because of the trauma that oc-
curred, because of the sadness they 
still had in their hearts. 
Let’s keep that in mind as we look 
down the path on how to address these 
types of issues and understand that it 
is a comprehensive approach. It is not 
just sending the police to a location 
and saying to a couple, ‘‘Let’s all go 
our different ways,’’ and then leave. 
Society has to understand that we need 
to do more. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I want to give the gentleman my 
most profound apology for my snafu. I 
respect the fact that he has decided to 
be a part of what I am a part of, but we 
are all a part of this House, and this 
House functions best when we are 
united and working together. So I 
greatly appreciate the gentleman and 
thank him for his commentary. 
Madam Speaker, let me continue 
with a few more facts, and then I would 
like to talk about the help that we can 
make available. 
Facts, statistical information: Afri-
can-American women experience inti-
mate partner violence at a rate 35 per-
cent higher than White women and 
about 2.5 times the rate of other races. 
But African-American women are less 
likely than White women to use social 
services or battered women’s programs 
or to go to the hospital because of do-
mestic violence. 
Somehow, we must get the word to 
women of color and make it clear to 
them that they can be protected. 
As a lawyer, I can recall a cir-
cumstance where a victim of domestic 
violence came to my office for help. I, 
obviously, wanted to help her, recog-
nizing her condition. 
She didn’t have to tell me that she 
was a victim. It was very obvious, 
looking at her physicality. Her eyes 
were battered and swollen. Her face 
was bruised. You could see where some-
one had held her arm tightly, to the ex-
tent that there were marks on her 
body. She was truly a battered person, 
and she wanted help. 
Her mother was with her. Her mother 
begged that we do something to help 
her daughter, and we did. We helped 
her with the filing of her case. 
Here is something that will break 
your heart because it broke my heart. 
Within days after her case was filed, 
she came back to the office, and she 
wanted me to help her get the charges 
dismissed. It hurts my heart to even 
tell the story. 
No amount of pleas could change her 
position because she felt that somehow 
she had acted too quickly. She felt that 
somehow they should be able to work 
this out without intervention. She felt 
that he was the breadwinner for the 
family, and somehow, she would be de-
nied access to the breadwinner. 
It was a very painful thing for her, 
much more painful than it was for me, 
I am sure. But it was still a painful in-
cident in my life. 
I mention this because, with the sta-
tistical information indicating that 
women of color don’t go to the hos-
pital, they don’t go through the var-
ious programs. I mention this because 
in Texas now, the law has changed, 
such that the woman is not forced to 
testify against her husband to the ex-
tent that it was the case before. The 
State can bring the charges now. 
Unfortunately, for too long, women 
were put in a position where they had 
to give the testimony. They were 
forced to give the testimony. The testi-
mony had to come from some source, 
so it came from them. 
But now, the State of Texas can 
bring these charges, and it doesn’t have 
to be the spouse against the spouse. 
I think this is an important step for-
ward. But this is not enough. 
We have to assure women that they 
can come forward and coming forward

will not cause them to be victimized to 
an even greater extent. We have to give 
them this assurance, which means that 
there have to be counselors available 
for them to visit with. 
They will have to have the oppor-
tunity to find a safe house, a place 
where they can start their lives with-
out fear each day that something may 
happen. 
This is the kind of thing that we can 
do here in Congress with our legisla-
tion and that we have been doing, to be 
very candid, providing safe houses, 
making sure that the persons are taken 
care of. This is important. 
Noncitizen victims of domestic vio-
lence report heightened concerns with 
accessing law enforcement and services 
due to uncertainty arising from chang-
ing immigration policies and height-
ened immigration enforcement. 
Noncitizens must be given the same 
opportunity to get help as citizens. We 
cannot assume that somehow a noncit-
izen is not worthy of the same level of 
help as citizens. Victims are human 
beings. To the same extent as persons 
who are born in this country as those 
who are born outside of this country, 
we have to protect all victims. 
There are some who don’t want to see 
us spend as much money on persons 
who are undocumented. There are 
some. But I believe that, in this House, 
we have people who understand that it 
doesn’t matter where you are from, 
how you got here. If you are the victim 
of a crime, you ought to get the help 
that you merit by virtue of having an 
infraction committed against you. If 
you are the victim of a crime, it 
doesn’t matter your place of origin. If 
you need help, we will help you. And 
we should help you beyond simply al-
lowing you to file charges against a 
person. 
While you are here, we have to pro-
tect you. You ought to have a safe 
house available to you as well, regard-
less of where you are from. 
At least 15,500,000 children live in 
families in which domestic violence oc-
curred at least once in the past year— 
at least once in the past year. 
One in 15 children are exposed to inti-
mate partner violence each year, and 90 
percent of these children are eye-
witnesses to such violence. Children 
should 
not 
be 
exposed 
to 
a 
cir-
cumstance where one parent is harm-
ing another or where any person is 
harming another person. 
Children exposed to domestic vio-
lence are more likely to attempt sui-
cide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away 
from home, and become victims of 
human trafficking. 
One large study found that men ex-
posed to physical abuse, sexual abuse, 
or adult domestic violence as children 
were four times more likely than other 
men to have perpetrated domestic vio-
lence as an adult. 
I spoke of this earlier. Some things 
bear repeating. Men who were exposed 
to physical abuse, sexual abuse, and do-
mestic violence are four times more 
likely than other men to perpetrate do-
mestic violence as adults. 
The approach to ending domestic vio-
lence has to be holistic. It has to be an 
approach that deals with each and 
every aspect of it. We cannot decide 
that we are going to take on a portion 
of it and assume that the rest will take 
care of itself. It doesn’t take care of 
itself. It only gets exacerbated. 
We have to do more to protect per-
sons, regardless of their gender, as it 
relates to domestic violence. 
b 1330 
I now would like to move to what I 
said I would talk about earlier, the fact 
that we have to do more than get the 
word out, the fact that it is not enough 
to sympathize and empathize. Sym-
pathy and empathy are worthy of 
praise, but we have got to do more 
than sympathize and empathize. We 
are attempting to do more. 
In the Heroes Act 2, we have domes-
tic violence grants and funding. The 
updated Heroes Act provides critical 
health and economic support to com-
munities and families: $100 million in 
additional funding for family violence 
prevention and services is available. It 
will provide much-needed support for 
domestic violence organizations by 
waiving matching requirements on all 
Federal moneys. These funds are for 
the duration of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
And when I say Federal funds, I am 
talking about family violence preven-
tion and services programs. 
$375 million dollars is for Violence 
Against Women programs, with a waiv-
er of local match requirements, includ-
ing: $100 million in grants to combat 
violence against women, $100 million 
for sexual assault victims so that they 
may have assistance, $50 million for as-
sistance to Tribal governments, $40 
million for transitional housing assist-
ance grants, $25 million to enhance cul-
turally specific services for victims of 
domestic violence, $25 million for out-
reach and services to underserved pop-
ulations, $20 million for rural domestic 
violence and child abuse enforcement 
assistance, and $15 million to support 
families in the justice system. These 
are moneys in the Heroes Act for vic-
tims of domestic violence. 
We have $62.5 billion for administra-
tion for children and families. This will 
provide supportive and social services 
for families and children through pro-
grams, including: $100 million for fam-
ily violence prevention and services, 
which includes $2 million for the Na-
tional Domestic Violence Hotline—I 
will be giving that number out in just 
a moment; $4 billion in tenant-based 
rental assistance. 
This will allow public housing agen-
cies to respond to coronavirus and the 
ability to keep over 2.2 million families 
stably housed even when facing a loss 
of income, including $1 billion for new 
and temporary vouchers for individuals 
and families who are homeless or at 
risk of becoming homeless or fleeing 
domestic violence. This will allow the 
PHAs to have the flexibility necessary 
for the safe and effective administra-
tion of these funds, while maintaining 
fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor 
standards, and other environmental 
protections. 
There are grants to assist low-income 
women and survivors of domestic vio-
lence in obtaining qualified domestic 
violence relations orders. This provi-
sion directs the Secretary of Labor, 
acting through the Director of the 
Women’s Bureau in conjunction with 
the Assistant Secretary of the Em-
ployee Benefits Security Administra-
tion, to award grants of at least 
$250,000 to establish community-based 
organizations on a competitive basis to 
assist low-income women and survivors 
of 
domestic 
violence 
in 
obtaining 
qualified domestic relations orders to 
ensure that these women actually ob-
tain the benefits to which they are en-
titled through these orders. 
Simply put, we are assisting women 
to get court orders that can protect 
them. 
As a judge in a former life, we were 
in a position to issue retraining orders 
to protect persons who were being 
threatened. Well, this is the money to 
assist in allowing people to acquire 
these restraining orders. 
The domestic violence hotline, I indi-
cated that I would give you the num-
ber, Madam Speaker, so if you need 
help and you have heard of what is 
available and what we would like to 
have available, here is the number. It 
is a National Domestic Violence Hot-
line. It operates 24/7. The number is, 
and I shall repeat it, 1–800–799–7233. 1– 
800–799–7233. 
I would beg that, if you believe you 
need help, you would call this number. 
I would hope that we will pass the 
bill that will provide all of these var-
ious services that I have called to your 
attention. It is a crisis. It is a crisis 
within a crisis. 
But we have the power to change 
these things, and my hope is that we 
will use this power. It is not enough to 
be sympathetic and empathetic. We 
have to do more. We can be helpful. 
Sympathy and empathy are wonderful 
things, but they won’t replace the 
money necessary to provide persons 
with counseling, provide them with a 
safe house, and provide them with 
healthcare that they would need as a 
result of domestic violence. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

I have a unanimous consent request.

AIRLINE RELIEF 
(Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, in 
plain English what you just said is that 
the Republican majority killed this 
legislation plain and simple. 
If they had just agreed, then tens of 
thousands of workers for the airlines— 
flight attendants, they don’t get paid a 
heck of a lot of money; pilots, yeah, 
they do well; mechanics and gate 
agents; tens of thousands of those peo-
ple have been furloughed as of yester-
day. They have lost their jobs, they 
have lost their healthcare, and some of 
them are going to lose their homes. 
They don’t know how they are going 
to make ends meet, feed their kids, or 
do anything else all because the Repub-
licans in the House of Representatives 
would not agree and the Republicans in 
the Senate will not agree to a larger 
package which contains these provi-
sions. These are vital provisions, and 
they are time sensitive. 
But the larger package would provide 
relief to tens of millions of Americans, 
the Heroes package. The Heroes pack-
age would extend healthcare to people 
who have lost it. The Heroes package 
would extend unemployment to people 
who have lost it. The Heroes package 
would send out individual checks. The 
Heroes package would send money to 
keep small businesses going. And this

include money for—

October 2, 2020 
RECOGNIZING JUDGE CHUNG K. 
PAK 
HON. DAVID J. TRONE 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Judge Chung K. Pak, who was 
recently appointed Chief Administrative Law 
Judge of the Maryland Office of Administrative 
Hearings. 
On June 10, 2020, Judge Pak made Mary-
land State history by becoming the third Chief 
Administrative Law Judge of the Maryland Of-
fice of Administrative Hearings, and the first 
ever minority Chief Administrative Law Judge. 
As Chief Administrative Law Judge, he leads 
the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings 
(OAH) and its Administrative Law judges, who 
are responsible for conducting fair and impar-
tial hearings to resolve a variety of disputes 
stemming from actions of Maryland’s many ex-
ecutive agencies. 
Prior to this appointment, Judge Pak served 
as an Administrative Patent Judge at the 
United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board 
for over 23 years, where he adjudicated over 
6,000 patent cases involving emerging tech-
nologies and complex legal issues and wrote 
over 2000 opinions eligible for appeal to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
Judge Pak also served as a corporate intellec-
tual property counsel at Union Carbide Cor-
poration and Praxair, Inc. While there, he pro-
vided legal advice and counsel on a wide 
range of intellectual property issues, including 
domestic and foreign patent procurement, liti-
gation, trade secrets, antitrust, licensing, and 
technology transfer issues. 
Although Judge Pak is a proud and longtime 
Marylander, he grew up in Alabama after he 
and his family immigrated to the United States 
from South Korea over 49 years ago. Like 
many immigrants, Judge Pak and his family 
faced difficulties due to limited economic re-
sources and language and cultural barriers. 
However, due to their resolve, hard work, 
faith, and neighbors’ help and friendship, 
Judge Pak and his family were able to over-
come these obstacles. In the years that fol-
lowed, Judge Pak worked his way through 
school and graduated from Auburn University 
with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chem-
ical Engineering. He later graduated from the 
Columbus School of Law at The Catholic Uni-
versity of America with a Juris Doctor degree 
while working as a U.S. Patent Examiner at 
the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Judge 
Pak then was admitted to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Fourth Circuit, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit, Maryland Bar, Virginia Bar, 
D.C. Bar and Patent Bar. 
Judge Pak’s dedication to public service and 
making a difference in our country and com-
munity is also evident in his activism. Justice 
Pak is a highly venerated civic activist and 
leader in Montgomery County and Maryland. 
Over the years, he has served on the boards 
of and in leadership positions on a number of 
nonprofit community organizations. In par-
ticular, he has served as Commissioner of 
Maryland Higher Education Commission, the 
Maryland Governor’s Commission on Asian 
Pacific American Affairs, and Montgomery 
County License Commission; Co-Chairman of 
the Montgomery County NAACP Multicultural 
Partnership; Board Member of Progressive 
Maryland, 
Montgomery 
County 
Branch 
NAACP, Committee for Montgomery, Maryland 
Attorney General’s Advisory Council, Mont-
gomery County Executive’s Asian American 
Advisory Board, Montgomery County State’s 
Attorney’s Asian American Advisory Board, 
and Montgomery Upcounty Citizens Advisory 
Board; Chairman and President of League of 
Korean Americans of Maryland; Montgomery 
County Asian American Police Advisory Com-
mittee, Taskforce to reduce racial tension in 
John F. Kennedy High School, Comptroller 
Peter Franchot’s Transition Team, and County 
Executive Ike Leggett’s Transition Team. 
Known as a consensus and bridge builder, 
Judge Pak has worked closely with Latino, Af-
rican American, Asian Pacific American, labor, 
women, religious, and civil rights groups on 
issues of common concern. His extraordinary 
life story and significant contributions to the 
community have been featured in the Ga-
zette’s ‘‘One of Forty Who Cared,’’ and in 
other newspaper articles. For his outstanding 
service and contributions, he was inducted 
into Montgomery County Human Rights Hall of 
Fame. He also received International Leader-
ship Award; The President’s Volunteer Service 
Award; Maryland Governor’s Volunteer Serv-
ice Award; Progressive Maryland’s Progres-
sive Leader Award; Montgomery County Ex-
ecutive’s Office of Community Partnership’s 
Trailblazer Award, MCDCC’s Kelsey Cook Vol-
unteer of Year Award; Census Department’s 
Census Outstanding Volunteer Service Award; 
Asian Pacific American Chamber of Com-
merce Outstanding Community Leader Award, 
Federal Asian Pacific American Council Out-
standing Leader Award, Maryland Coalition of 
100 Organizations for Recognition of Asian 
Lunar New Year’s STAR of Maryland Asian 
Pacific American Community Award; League 
of Korean Americans of Maryland Outstanding 
Service and Presidential Awards; Korean 
American Senior Citizens’ Advocate Award; 
Montgomery County Branch NAACP Certifi-
cate of Appreciation; USPTO Asian Pacific 
American Network Leadership Award; and 
many other awards. As Senator Barbara Mi-
kulski once said, ‘‘Judge Pak has spent a life-
time fighting injustice and inequality. His story 
is truly an embodiment of the American dream 
and an example of leadership with compas-
sion and commitment to public service.’’ 
HONORING RALPH ELLIOT BOWEN, 
THE 
LAST 
SURVIVING 
WORLD 
WAR 
II 
VETERAN 
FROM 
THE 
SENECA

TERRITORY,

STATE 
SENATE’S 
VETERANS’ 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Sergeant Ralph Elliot Bowen, the last 
surviving World War II veteran from the Sen-
eca Nation’s Allegany Territory, for being in-
ducted into the New York State Senate Vet-
erans’ Hall of Fame. Ralph, who recently 
turned ninety-eight years old in August, should 
be celebrated and honored for his bravery and 
sacrifice. 
Ralph fought in the European Campaign as 
a B–24 Liberator heavy bomber aerial gunner 
from 1941 to 1945. He helped in the efforts to 
liberate France and Europe during that time. 
He was also a member of the 15th Air Force’s 
450th Bombardment Group, in the 723rd Bom-
bardment Squadron. The unit was involved in 
missions over France, Austria, Germany, the 
Balkans and Greece. 
Ralph is currently the oldest living member 
of the Seneca Nation. He is a member of the 
Snipe Clan, and served five terms as Tribal 
Councilor, as well as tenures as Peacemaker 
and Seneca Nation Surrogate Judge. He also 
served as Seneca Nation Marshal and pastor 
for the Red House Baptist Church. 
In 2019, Ralph was presented with the 
French Legion of Honor for his military service 
during World War II. He is the first Seneca 
and second Native American to receive the 
appointment of Knight in the Order of the Le-
gion of Honor. 
Ralph’s service to our nation during a time 
of great need is something that should be re-
vered and remembered. We cannot forget the 
great personal risk and dedication he showed 
during his service. Today, we stand and honor 
his service and sacrifice. Today, we recognize 
Ralph, for his courage, resolve and bravery— 
and I thank him for all that he has done. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
honor Sergeant Ralph Elliot Bowen, the fast 
surviving World War II veteran from the Sen-
eca Nation’s Allegany Territory.

her on her retirement following decades of 
service to Fairfax City and our Northern Vir-
ginia community. 
As Chairman of the Fairfax City Independ-
ence Day Celebration Committee, Beverly has 
donated her time, skills, and talent with faithful 
displays of leadership and commitment. Fair-
fax City’s Independence Day Celebration con-
tinues to be one of the biggest and best cele-
brations of our nation’s birthday in the Com-
monwealth of Virginia. Its signature event, the 
Independence Day Parade, attracts partici-
pants and spectators from throughout the re-
gion and is an event that I have had the privi-
lege of participating in for years. Every year 
the parade has continued to grow and flourish, 
and due to Beverly’s efforts, all who attend are 
guaranteed to have a wonderful time. 
Beverly has also dedicated her time serving 
as Chairman of the Chocolate Lovers Festival 
Committee. Her leaderships with this festival, 
another event that I have enjoyed attending 
over the years, has helped increase the fes-
tival’s popularity and attendance. Because of 
Beverly’s tireless work behind these events, 
the City of Fairfax benefited tremendously in 
reputation, city visits, and economic gain. 
Through Beverly’s work, she has brought to-
gether the community and enhanced vol-
unteerism. Because of her selfless dedication, 
she has received several community honors 
and awards recognizing her efforts. These 
honors include the PRAB Exemplary Service 
Award (2020), Volunteer of the Year Award 
(2017), Mayor’s Award for Outstanding Com-
munity Service and Dedication to Volunteerism 
(2012) and VFW Post No. 8469 Americanism 
Award Citation (2010) to name a few of her 
accolades. 
I often say that the health and happiness of 
a community can be measured in part by the 
spirit of community and volunteerism that ex-
ists. Beverly embodies this spirit of service 
and we have all benefited from her service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Beverly Myers and in thanking 
her for her years of selfless service to our 
community. As Beverly retires and returns 
home to Missouri, we wish her continued 
health, happiness, and success.

NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS 
CONSERVATION EXTENSION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, over four months 
ago, the House passed the Heroes Act to sup-
port our nation’s heroes and everyday Ameri-
cans to meet the challenges of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Unfortunately, the Senate has refused to 
take up this vital legislation, and many sen-
ators seem to believe that Congress has al-
ready done enough. The truth is that the 
needs of our country have only increased. 
Today 13.6 million Americans are unemployed 
and 200,000 Americans have died from 
COVID–19, with cases rising again around the 
country. 
The House is serious about providing relief 
to Americans and reaching a compromise with 
the Senate and the White House which is why 
today’s Heroes Act is $1.2 trillion less than the 
original bill we passed in March. Although 
smaller, today’s bill still meets the needs of 
the American people by putting money in their 
pockets to strengthen our economy and pro-
viding the resources we need to crush the 
virus. Specifically, the updated Heroes Act in-
cludes the following: 
An additional $600 per week in Unemploy-
ment Insurance through January 2021; 
A second round of $1,200 checks to most 
taxpayers and $500 for their dependents; 
$75 billion for testing, tracing, and treatment 
to get COVID–19 under control; 
$436 billion to state and local governments 
who employ heroes like first responders and 
health care workers who are at risk of losing 
their jobs; 
$225 billion for K to 12 school, colleges, and 
universities to address the challenges of dis-
tance learning in the new school year; 
$71 billion for renters and homeowners to 
ensure they don’t lose their housing during the 
pandemic; 
Over $15 billion for connectivity, including 
$12 billion to close the homework gap, $3 bil-
lion to keep low-income Americans connected, 
and $200 million for telehealth. 
The new Heroes Act is proof that the House 
is willing to compromise in order to deliver

DR. JAMES ‘‘JIM’’ WALTER 
BARTLING 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in remembrance of a true health 
care hero, Dr. James ‘‘Jim’’ Walter Bartling, 
who passed away on September 24 at the 
age of 70. 
Jim dedicated his life to being an amazing 
son, brother, husband, father, teacher, coun-
selor, pharmacist, and friend. 
His life was marked by his contributions to 
the practice of pharmacy as soon as he grad-
uated from Mercer University Southern School 
of Pharmacy with a Bachelor of Science de-
gree in Pharmacy, as well as a Doctorate in 
Pharmacy degree. 
Jim practiced at Doctors Memorial Hospital 
in Atlanta before being named Director of Ad-
missions, Job Placement, and Continuing Edu-
cation at Mercer University, and eventually be-
came the Dean for Student Affairs and Admis-
sions and served in that role for 38 years until 
he retired in 2016. 
He was also committed to counseling and 
supporting pharmacists, student pharmacists, 
and pharmacy technicians with substance 
abuse disorders. 
As a pharmacist myself, I am immensely 
grateful for the work he did to leave a lasting 
impact on the pharmacy profession and the 
countless lives he touched. 
His legacy will surely continue for many 
years to come. 
CONGRATULATING MELANIE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Melanie Kennedy 
on her recent election to the Board of Direc-
tors of the National Association of Federally- 
Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU). 
Ms. Kennedy is the President and CEO of 
Southwest Financial Federal Credit Union in

ly 14 years. Known for her collaboration and 
networking skills, she has the unique ability to 
help others achieve greatness. 
Ms. Kennedy recognizes the role credit 
unions play in a functioning economy and is 
thoroughly dedicated to the success of the in-
dustry. Her wealth of financial services knowl-
edge opened up leadership opportunities, in-
cluding her most recent position as the Treas-
urer and Executive Committee member of the 
Cornerstone Resources Board of Directors. 
Ms. Kennedy attended the University of 
Texas at Arlington and is also an active mem-
ber of her community—volunteering at the 
Promise 
House, 
an 
organization 
helping 
homeless youth in Dallas. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Texas’s 30th 
Congressional District, I’d like to wish Ms. 
Kennedy the best of luck in her new role on 
the NAFCU Board of Directors. I am confident 
that her skill set will complement the board 
and its associated credit unions for years to 
come, and I look forward to working with her.

IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY OF 
THE 
LATE 
HAJJ 
MOHAMAD 
MEHANNA (ABU IMAD) 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the esteemed 
life of the late Hajj Mohamad Kamal Mehanna 
(Abu Imad). He will forever be remembered for 
his tremendous service to our community, and 
he will be deeply missed. 
Hajj Abu Imad was a true embodiment of 
the American dream. In 1988, he immigrated 
to the United States from Lebanon and quickly 
dedicated himself to supporting his local com-
munity in the Metro Detroit region. He was a 
founder and board member of the Islamic In-
stitute of Knowledge, an organization that 
strives to support the spiritual, informational, 
educational, and social needs of Michigan’s Is-
lamic community. Hajj Abu Imad committed 
himself to furthering the vision and mission of 
the Islamic Institute of Knowledge, and he 
served as the Chairman for the Public Rela-
tions Committee for many years. Even after 
immigrating to the United States, Hajj Abu 
Imad remained faithful to honoring his heritage 
and supporting Lebanon. He made several 
trips to Lebanon to meet with the President 
and Prime Minister to discuss ways to pro-
mote progress and meet the evolving needs of 
the Lebanese community. 
Throughout Michigan, Hajj Abu Imad was 
recognized as a humble, kind, and dapper

gentleman. He was a man of great wisdom 
who offered comforting words of guidance in 
troubling times. He was a loyal friend to all 
those who knew him and left others in good 
spirits. He valued friendships and sought to 
develop deep, lasting, and meaningful relation-
ships with others. He was a member in a so-
cial group known as ‘‘Khalan Al-Wafa,’’ where 
he endeavored to make connections, discuss 
issues, and foster a deep sense of community 
and unity. Most importantly of all, Hajj Abu 
Imad was devoted to his family. He married 
his wife Hajjah Aziza Anani in 1967, and the 
two shared a fruitful and prosperous marriage 
of 53 years. Together, they raised a beautiful 
family. At his death, Hajj Abu Imad was the 
beloved patriarch of seven children and four-
teen grandchildren. He will be missed by all, 
but his memory will endure through the count-
less lives he touched. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of the late 
Hajj Mohamad Kamal Mehanna (Abu Imad). 
His passing is a loss to our entire conununity. 
May he rest in eternal peace.

OF 
PARKER-GRAY 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I recognize the 100th anni-
versary of the Parker-Gray High School in the 
City of Alexandria, Virginia. 
Parker-Gray High School opened in Sep-
tember of 1920 and provided countless African 
American students with a comprehensive edu-
cation during a time of segregation. Though 
faced with adversity—lack of resources, teach-
ers, and facilities—Parker-Gray was able to 
provide students with what is now understood 
as a fundamental right. 
The alumnae of Parker-Gray took their edu-
cation and were able to apply it to not only the 
City of Alexandria, but to all aspects of their 
lives. 
Please join me in honoring the 100th anni-
versary of Parker-Gray High School. It is im-
portant that we continue its mission and en-
sure the Parker-Gray legacy lives on.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANTHONY 
‘‘TONY’’ ETCHISON 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Tony Etchison, an Indiana basketball legend, 
accomplished farmer, and loving family man. 
Born on April 14, 1972, in Tipton, Indiana, 
Tony was a life-long Hoosier. He dedicated 
much of his life to athletics and giving back to 
the youth teams in Indiana’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. While we mourn Tony’s unex-
pected death, we are forever grateful for his 
endless victories and accomplishments, both 
on and off the basketball court. 
Tony 
graduated 
from 
Noblesville 
High 
School in 1991 where he began his standout 
career in basketball. As a four-year letter win-
ner and leader of three consecutive sectional 
championship teams for Noblesville, Tony was 
chosen as the County Player of the Year for 
two seasons and was named All-Hamilton 
County four times. His countless accomplish-
ments in high school led to a scholarship op-
portunity at Mercer University in Georgia 
where he continued his athletic career as a 
star basketball player. 
He led his team in the Trans American Con-
ference in three-point shooting during his four- 
year collegiate career. Tony made Mercer Uni-
versity history by being the first player to earn 
Trans American All-Academic Team honors all 
four years he played. He completed his edu-
cation and graduated in 1995, from Mercer’s 
Stetson School of Business & Economics with 
a Bachelors of Arts in Business Administration 
and Finance. After completing his education 
Tony returned home and began work for the 
family business, Etchison Farms. It was also 
during this time in Tony’s life that he began a 
twenty-two year career as an agent for Indiana 
Farm Bureau Insurance, serving many families 
in the Fifth District. 
As an adult, Tony’s earlier athletic accom-
plishments did not go unnoticed. In 2009, he 
was inducted into the Hamilton County Bas-
ketball Hall of Fame. Later in 2016, he was in-
ducted into the Noblesville High School Ath-
letic Hall of Fame and honored by the Indiana 
Basketball Hall of Fame by being selected to 
be a teammate on their 2016 Silver Anniver-
sary Team. In July of 2019, Tony was elected 
as a director of the Indiana Basketball Hall of 
Fame. In addition to his basketball career, 
Tony loved to coach youth sports in the area. 
Tony’s proudest role in life was being a hus-
band and father. Tony and his wife, Toby, 
were blessed with three sons: John Phillip or 
‘‘JP’’, a freshman at Indiana University, Gus, a 
junior at Hamilton Heights High School, and 
Tillman, an 8th grader at Hamilton Heights 
Middle School. One of Tony’s greatest joys in 
life was having the opportunity to share with 
his sons his love of all sports, and the joy of 
competition. 
Tony died tragically on October 23, 2019, 
on the family farm in Arcadia, Indiana. Tony 
will be forever missed by his family, friends, 
colleagues, and the entire Indiana basketball 
community. On behalf of Indiana’s Fifth Con-
gressional District, I extend my deepest con-
dolences to Tony’s wife, Toby, their three 
sons, the entire Etchison family, and their 
friends, who mourn his passing.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor the life of 
Mr. Jack Kaster who passed away on Sep-
tember 8 at the age of 91. 
Jack bravely served our country in the Ko-
rean War as a First Lieutenant in the Army 
and was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple 
Heart. 
He spent 33 years working with IBM, and 
then went on to spend 3 decades selflessly 
leading charitable organizations. 
Jack loved music and sports, especially golf, 
and was devoted to serving others with every 
opportunity he was given. 
He was president of the Fairfield County 
Council Boy Scouts, and he was impressively 
awarded the Silver Beaver, which is the high-
est national non-Scout honor. 
Jack was committed to improving education 
and literacy throughout his 20 years serving 
as Chairman and then lifetime board member 
of the Live Oak Public Libraries Foundation in 
Savannah. 
I am thankful for the selfless and honorable 
life Jack led. 
He will be dearly missed by his family, 
friends, and all who knew him.

RECOGNIZING GARLAND JAMES’ 
99TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I am here 
today to recognize the 99th birthday of my 
constituent, Garland James, on October 3rd, 
who is turning 99 years young. An active 
member of the Arizona community, Garland is 
a veteran, loving husband and father, and 
business owner whose life is symbolic of the 
American dream promised to all. 
A member of the greatest generation, Gar-
land arrived in Europe in 1944 in our great 
struggle against fascism. Landing at Nor-
mandy and serving through France, Germany, 
and Central Europe, Garland was a light truck 
driver, retrieving young Americans who had 
fallen on the battlefield. 
Returning from the war in 1945, Garland 
met his wife Mary while working as a truck 
driver across the Eastern part of the U.S. 
Their new family moved out West, and over 
the course of the following decades, Garland 
would find success in the tire industry, open-
ing a series of stores in Arizona and Cali-
fornia. In fact, his stores in Apache Junction 
and Tuba City still stand today, with the 
Apache Junction store remaining in the family, 
managed and owned by his son. 
Madam Speaker, it is a great honor to rep-
resent Garland James, a true patriot and shin-
ing example of a good man, father, and cit-
izen. I urge all my colleagues to join me in 
wishing Garland a very happy 99th birthday, to 
thank him for his service to this great nation, 
and to wish him well as we wait for this time 
next year to share in his 100th birthday cele-
bration.

the 2020 Congressional Art Competition. Due 
to the coronavirus, this year’s competition was 
held remotely. The theme of this year’s art-
work focused on the Indian River Lagoon. 
This year a total of thirty-one students from

Finch. Rain Perlman of Merritt Island High for 
‘‘At the Beach’’ earned the Second Place 
Award. Her teacher is Lara Klopp. 
This year the judges also selected two

Representatives to join me in congratulating 
these fine students for their creative efforts 
and saluting all students across the United 
States who accepted the challenge to partici-
pate in this year’s Congressional Art Competi-

RECOGNIZING THE EARLY DEER 
PARK SETTLERS TEXAS HISTOR-
ICAL MONUMENT DEDICATION 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the dedication of the Deer Park 
Early Settlers Texas State Historical Marker in 
Deer Park, Harris County, Texas. The text of 
marker reads as follows: 
In 1928, Shell Oil Company purchased land 
in Deer Park, Texas for a new petrochemical 
refinery. Surveyors discovered a marble 
headstone broken into four pieces. Shell re-
assembled the headstone and maintained the 
area as an actual gravesite. In 1976, Shell 
was given permission from the Texas Histor-
ical Commission, as well as the Harris Coun-
ty attorney and Harris County judge to relo-
cate the marker and disinter any remains. In 
March of 1977, the marble headstone and a 
small cement casket, from the original site, 
were moved to Dow Park in the City of Deer 
Park. 
The inscription on the headstone gave the 
name of two siblings, Mary W. Jackson and 
William Wilson. These early settlers died in 
1834. William Wilson purchased land in the 
early 1830’s and built a cabin on the bank of 
the Buffalo Bayou with his wife and children. 
This was adjacent to what became the site of 
the Battle of San Jacinto that secured 
Texas’ independence from Mexico in 1836. 
William Wilson also owned land near the set-
tlement of Crosby. Humphrey Jackson, one 
of the ‘‘Old 300’’ settlers, owned land near the 
Wilson property in Crosby. It was presumed 
that Mary W. Jackson was somehow associ-
ated with Humphrey, based on a judgement 
recorded in Harris County records in 1852. 
This could explain why Mary Wilson became 
Mary W. Jackson. 
The 186-year-old headstone is one of the 
oldest marked headstones in Harris County 
and Deer Park’s oldest artifact. The histor-
ical marker reflects the history of Deer 
Park, as well as the history of Texas. The 
historical marker presents a glimpse of ordi-
nary people in Texas in the 1830’s and com-
memorates these early Deer Park settlers. 
As a former member of the Texas Historical 
Commission, I know that this is a great honor 
for the community. I wish all of my friends in 
Deer Park well as they celebrate the dedica-
tion on October 20th.

HONORING DR. BETTINA ‘‘TINA’’ 
ATKINS 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Dr. Bettina ‘‘Tina’’ Atkins, 
a pioneer in education who passed away on 
Saturday, August 22, 2020, at the age of 61. 
Dr. Bettina ‘‘Tina’’ Atkins was born in Des 
Moines, Iowa, later moving to South Texas as 
a teenager. She graduated from McAllen High 
School in 1977 and earned a Bachelor of Arts 
Degree with Honors in Communication from 
the University of Texas, Pan American (UTPA) 
in 1981, now the University of Texas Rio 
Grande Valley (UTRGV). 
Dr. Atkins went on to earn a Masters De-
gree in Educational Leadership at UTPA in 
1993 and a Ph.D. in Organization Leadership 
from Our Lady of the Lake University in 2015. 
She shared her love of and commitment to 
lifelong learning with thousands of children in 
South Texas. 
Dr. Atkins’ dedication to educational equality 
made her one of the most influential women in 
South Texas in the field of higher education. 
Dr. Atkins spent 24 years with Region One, an 
organization that assists school districts im-
prove student performance and implement ini-
tiatives assigned by the state legislature or 
education commissioner. During her tenure 
with Region One, Dr. Atkins helped bring the 
first GEAR-UP grant to South Texas in 1999. 
These grants are designed to provide more 
low-income students with the tools and re-
sources needed to succeed in postsecondary 
education. 
Eventually, Dr. Atkins became the Director 
of several GEAR-UP grants, helping over 
25,000 students and their families reach post-
secondary education, changing their lives for-
ever. Dr. Atkins also helped launch Project 
Heal2, which supports students who are inter-
ested in pursuing a nursing degree in high 
school through college. Dr. Atkins’ accomplish-
ments do not stop there, but I would like to 
take a moment to talk about her love for her 
family. 
Dr. Atkins achieved all these incredible feats 
while being the ‘‘happy coordinator’’ for her 
family and her friends. She was a proud sister, 
aunt, and daughter. She emanated joy and 
positive energy everywhere she went. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Bettina ‘‘Tina’’ Atkins 
was an incredible leader and a shining light for 
South Texas. Her accomplishments will cer-
tainly be remembered for generations to 
come. I stand here today to thank Dr. Atkins 
for her contributions to the world, and I wish 
her family peace during these difficult times. 
She will be greatly missed.

CONGRATULATING HOLLEY DEAN 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Holley Dean of Sa-
vannah, Georgia, for being named to Forbes’ 
America’s Top Women Wealth Advisors List 
for 2020. 
Ms. Dean is remarkably one of ten women 
who were selected from a pool of 32,000 
nominations. 
Top advisors across the country were nomi-
nated by their firms and then researched, 
interviewed, and assigned a ranking within 
their respective states. 
Service models, investing process, client re-
tention, experience levels, review of compli-
ance records, and firm nominations are some 
of many factors considered. 
The decision is also based on quantitative 
criteria, such as assets under management 
and revenue generated for their firms. 
Holley currently serves as a financial advi-
sor for Stifel, which is a diversified global 
wealth management and investment banking 
company. 
Her hard work and dedication throughout 
the years has clearly paid off, and she de-
serves to be honored and celebrated for this 
amazing accomplishment. 
I wish her the best of luck in the years to 
come.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
MIDDLERIDGE 
COMMUNITY OF FAIRFAX COUN-
TY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Middleridge community. 
Located in the heart of Fairfax County and 
the 11th Congressional District of Virginia, 
Middleridge is a tight-knit community and the 
land on which it is built is steeped in history. 
The very name of Middleridge was derived 
from a 1766 decision of the Vestry of Truro 
Parish, including George Washington and 
Colonel George William Fairfax, to establish 
the new Payne’s Church at the ‘‘middle Ridge’’ 
of Ox Road. 
On July 17, 1970 the grand opening of Sec-
tion 1 Middleridge, consisting of 39 lots, was 
announced in The Evening Star. It was adver-
tised by the developer as being in ‘‘the best of 
Virginian tradition.’’ ‘‘Surrounded by the rich 
history of the county, its homes radiate with 
old charm and aristocratic character.’’ Today 
the community consists of 578 homes situated 
on approximately ninety-five acres and boasts 
amenities including a lake, large park, basket-
ball and tennis courts, and swimming pool.

October 2, 2020 
The all-volunteer Middleridge Civic Associa-
tion was formed in 1973. The civic association 
promotes an exceptionally strong sense of 
community that greets new residents with 
open arms, providing welcoming gifts to the 
newest neighbors. The Civic Association co-
ordinates 
regular 
stream 
clean-ups 
and 
awards annual scholarships to high school 
seniors. Annual events include an Easter egg 
hunt, home and garden tours, Halloween pa-
rade, a holiday light decorating contest and 
community movie nights. 
In 2002, Middleridge established a National 
Night Out celebration in partnership with the 
Fairfax County Police Department. Of the 
scores of NNO events held each year, the 
Middleridge National Night Out has been rec-
ognized as the largest event in the entire 
county—again a testament to the community 
spirit and activism of Middleridge residents. 
As the former president of the Mantua civic 
association, I know firsthand that a community 
is more than houses in a development. In fact, 
the health and well-being of a region can be 
measured by the involvement of its citizens. 
When residents invest their time, care, and 
energies, a true community is created to the 
benefit of all. Fairfax County is considered one 
of the best places in the nation in which to 
live, work and raise a family, largely because 
of the willingness of so many to become ac-
tively involved. Middleridge Civic Association 
and the residents of this neighborhood provide 
an excellent example of how to create a thriv-
ing, energetic, and welcoming place to call 
home. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commemorating the 50th Anniversary of 
Middleridge and in thanking the residents and 
civic association members and officers for 
their contributions and service to our commu-
nity.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. CHARLES 
W. REEDER, JR. 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Mr. Charles W. Reeder, Jr., 
who passed away on September 7, 2020, at 
the age of 69. Mr. Reeder’s love for his family 
and dedication to his community is noteworthy 
and admirable. While he will be truly missed 
by his family and friends, the impact he has 
had on his community will live on for genera-
tions to come. 
Mr. Reeder received a Master of Divinity 
from Virginia Theological Seminary and he 
later completed a Doctor of Ministry from Ash-
land Seminary and worked for Food for the 
Poor, raising funds for third world countries. 
During 40 years of ministry, he served church-
es in Ohio, Illinois, Washington, and Colorado. 
He also taught classes at several college 
venues as well as prisons. Teaching and 
preaching were his passions, and he excelled 
at both. He had a love for theology and phys-
ics, remodeling and good music. 
His life was filled with compassion, and he 
lived to serve the needs of others. His great-
est loves, however, were his wife, Pat, his two 
daughters, and his three precious grandsons. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to rise 
with me in honor of Mr. Charles Reeder, Jr. 
He will be profoundly missed, but his memory 
lives on in his family.

CELEBRATING JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
today we celebrate Ruth Bader Ginsburg. We 
remember her groundbreaking work and re-
markable legacy. We owe our opportunity to 
be who we are to what she accomplished. 
That’s why we call her the Notorious RBG. 
Justice Ginsburg defied expectations. De-
spite her acumen and proven ability in the law, 
she was denied jobs for which she was well- 
qualified. She nonetheless pursued that career 
at a time when social norms kept women at 
home and discouraged them from working. 
Justice Ginsburg showed up for a genera-
tion of women and men. Equality drove her 
work. 
Her vision and imagination demanded that 
she not allow an individual’s dreams be short-
changed by institutional inequality. 
When people are held back by unjust laws, 
they cannot flourish and thrive. She felt that in 
her bones, and she strove to fix it. 
As a Jewish woman, I feel a strong sense 
of identity with her. She was grounded in the 
teaching of Tikkun Olum—to repair the world 
and the Torah’s admonition that one doesn’t 
have to complete the work but cannot desist 
trying. 
Now, there will be not just a void with her 
passing, but a chasm as our role model—our 
champion of liberty, equality, and democracy. 
So we and future generations must pick up 
the torch and continue her fight.

HONORING MOHANDAS 
KARAMCHAND GANDHI 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Mahatma Gan-
dhi, one of the most influential men of the 
modern world. As we celebrate the close of 
the 150th anniversary of Gandhi’s birth, it is 
important to remember that his legacy is born 
out every day in the lives of billions of people 
who live the way they do because of his self-
less work. 
His teachings of non-violence have im-
pacted the entire world; and his promotion of 
racial, social, and political equality will con-
tinue to touch the global community as we 
work towards a brighter, freer future. 
It is vital that we continue to embody 
Gandhi’s perseverance and non-violent ways 
as we work to make the world a better place. 
Today, we honor his legacy and the power 
that an individual man had to change the 
world. 151 years ago, Gandhi was born an or-
dinary man. Today, he is a worldwide symbol 
of peace and civil disobedience. May he con-
tinue to rest in peace, and may his legacy pre-
vail eternally.

MALCOM BLAIR ‘‘MAL’’ WHITE 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in remembrance of Mr. Malcom 
Blair ‘‘Mal’’ White of Metter, Georgia, who 
passed away on September 21st. 
Mal was a beloved son, husband, father, 
grandfather, leader, and friend. 
Mal taught high school math at Savannah 
Country Day School in Georgia’s First District 
for over three decades. 
Mal generously and selflessly served Sa-
vannah Country Day in various roles, including 
math department chair, dean of students, 
Upper School assistant principal. 
He was dedicated to enriching the lives of 
all students and equally invested his time to 
athletics, including assisting with the varsity 
football and JV basketball teams, serving as 
the varsity girls basketball head coach, as well 
as serving as the varsity golf coach for over 
three decades. 
He led all teams to numerous victories. 
I am thankful for the lasting impact Mal 
made on his community, and I know his leg-
acy will continue at Savannah Country Day 
School for years to come. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to his fam-
ily, friends, and the countless students, par-
ents, and teachers’ lives he touched.

TRIBUTE TO BABA SHEIKH 
HON. JEFF FORTENBERRY 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to express my heartfelt condolences to 
the Yazidi community around the world and in 
my hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska on the 
loss of spiritual leader Baba Sheikh. 
In August 2014, ISIS launched a genocidal 
campaign against the Yazidi people in Iraq, 
killing and brutalizing thousands. Five years 
later, hundreds of thousands of Yazidis are 
still displaced in refugee camps in their own 
country. Throughout all this terror and diaboli-
cal suffering, the spiritual leader of the Yazidi 
people, Baba Sheikh, stood steady as a great 
source of comfort, love, and inspiration. 
Madam Speaker, it’s not widely known, but 
two years ago, at the behest of Vice President 
Pence, I traveled to Northern Iraq to assess 
the situation faced by religious minority com-
munities after the ISIS genocide. It was my 
privilege to meet with Baba Sheik. Together 
we met with the Yazidi women who had been 
enslaved by ISIS. I will never forget his 
gentleness, kindness, and eagerness to be 
with us even amidst all the suffering. 
May he rest in peace.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE FIRST 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE CUSTARD 
COMPANY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
The Custard Company on celebrating its first 
anniversary. This milestone is worthy of com-
mendation. 
The Custard Company is an ice cream shop 
located in Downtown Dearborn. Although only 
one year old, the Custard Company has al-
ready become a local favorite. The institution 
has established a stellar reputation throughout 
the community and endeavors to continue 
building meaningful and lasting connections 
with customers. The company prides itself on 
creating high-quality treats and ice cream cre-
ations including frozen custard, milkshakes, 
flurries, sundaes, and the cookie monster 
sandwich, to name a few. 
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the first anniversary of the Custard Company 
has given our community a reason to cele-
brate. Its vibrant environment, dedicated staff, 
and delectable treats have drawn friends and 
families together and make all feel welcome. 
The Custard Company’s demonstrated com-
mitment to serving Dearborn and all those in 
it is immensely appreciated, and we are con-
fident the institution will continue to thrive in 
the years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating The Custard Company’s first 
anniversary. Congratulations on a successful 
year, and best wishes for continued success 
in the years ahead.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR. 
JERRY KANE 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of Mr. Jerry Kane, a 
giant in the Corpus Christi community, who 
passed away on September 24th, 2020. A 
prominent businessman, public servant, and 
family man, Jerry was well-known and well- 
loved in our part of Texas. His family emi-
grated here after World War II from Czecho-
slovakia, where his parents survived the Holo-
caust and fought for the freedom of their peo-
ple. 
Jerry spent many years in the family meat- 
packing business, and during his time as 
President and CEO, he moved the company 
forward through innovation and pioneering 
new technologies. He was also a tremendous 
public servant for both the city of Corpus 
Christi and the state of Texas, serving on the 
Regional Water Task Force, the Governors 
Committee for Disaster Recovery and Re-
newal, and the Texas Board of Human Serv-
ices. 
Most importantly, Jerry was a devoted fam-
ily man. He especially loved spending time 
with his grandchildren, and was known for 
being friendly, caring, and always helpful. I 
offer my condolences to his family and friends 
as they grieve the loss of a great man. He will 
be fondly remembered by all.

CONGRESSIONAL 
COMMENDATION 
HONORING HISPANIC HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. Every 
year from September 15 to October 15, the 
history and culture of Americans who are from 
or have ancestors from Spain, Mexico, the 
Caribbean, and Central and South America is 
recognized and celebrated. This observation 
was first established as Hispanic Heritage 
Week under President Lyndon Johnson in 
1968 and President Ronald Reagan expanded 
the observance to a full month in 1988. This 
thirty-day period encapsulates many celebra-
tions of independence for Latin American 
countries. September 15 is the anniversary of 
independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico 
and Chile also celebrate their independence 
days on September 16 and September 18. 
Our great nation would not be the same 
without the profound influence of Hispanic 
Americans across the country. Men and 
women from numerous countries have come 
to the United States in search of a better life 
for themselves and their families. In turn, their 
contributions have brought new ideas, new 
cuisines, new cultures to us all, and their pres-
ence here has created a more prosperous na-
tion for all Americans. Guided by the promise 
of freedom and the chance to participate in 
the unique American experiment in democ-
racy, some of these individuals arrived with 
nothing but the clothes on their back and the 
hope of a better tomorrow. Hispanic Ameri-
cans have had influence on practically every 
part of American history, from politics to sports 
to sciences. Every day I am proud of their 
countless contributions to our country’s story, 
and I would like to take this month to honor 
the crucial role that Hispanic Americans play 
in our society, and in Georgia’s Sixth Congres-
sional District in particular. 
The Hispanic community in Georgia is vi-
brant and continues to grow significantly. I am 
proud to stand up and fight for the men and 
women who have contributed so much to our 
communities each day. Hispanic Americans 
help contribute to what makes this nation re-
markable, and I am honored to lift up the 
voices of those who have selflessly dedicated 
their lives to building up themselves, their 
community, and this country. During these un-
precedented times, we must work harder than 
ever to respect and encourage the diversity of 
our nation. I am routinely impressed by spirit 
of service and leadership displayed by His-
panic Americans in my district who work hard 
to give back to their own communities. Their 
work should be recognized every day, but par-
ticularly during Hispanic Heritage month. 
Therefore, I am honored to highlight three pro-
fessionals who deserve special recognition: 
Gilda ‘‘Gigi’’ Pedraza, Santiago Marquez, and 
Vanessa Kosky. 
Gilda ‘‘Gigi’’ Pedraza and her team at the 
Latino Community Fund—Georgia (LCF Geor-
gia) as they advocate for the Latino commu-
nity, work to increase civic participation, pro-
vide immediate relief to the most vulnerable 
communities and build grassroots organiza-
tions. Gigi has over 20 years of experience 
working for both nonprofit and for-profit spaces 
as a social entrepreneur. In 2018, she was the 
recipient of the NFL Hispanic Heritage Leader-
ship award and was recognized as a Woman 
of Inspiration by the Atlanta Dream. In the 
same year, she was named one of the 50 
Most Influential Latinos in Georgia. Gigi has 
participated on numerous boards including the 
Center for Pan-Asian Community Services and 
the Feminist Health Center. She is also a 
member of the ARC Global Voices Panel. Ad-
ditionally, Gigi was the Georgia Awardee of 
the TUMI USA Entrepreneur Award, which 
recognizes Peruvian immigrants for their civic 
contributions. Gigi’s roots are from Lima, Peru 
and she currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Santiago Marquez is the CEO of the Latin 
American Association (LAA). Marquez has 
held many impressive positions, including the 
Director of Employment and Housing for the 
Latin American Association, which was the 
first housing department to focus on Hispanics 
in Atlanta. He was also the Director of Latino 
Outreach at the Boys and Girls Clubs of 
America. He began working with the Georgia 
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 2008 and 
has since served as President and CEO. In 
2014, Santiago received an award from the 
National Diversity Council. He has served on 
multiple boards across Atlanta, including the 
Aurora Theatre and the WellStar Atlanta Com-
munity Board. He is also an alumnus of Lead-
ership Atlanta and the Buckhead Business 
Leadership Class. Santiago was born in Cuba 
but now lives in Atlanta with his wife and two 
daughters. 
Vanessa Kosky was just recently appointed 
to be an associate judge of the city of 
Doraville, and she will be the city’s first Latina 
judge. A graduate of John Marshall Law 
School, she was admitted to the State Bar of 
Georgia in October of 2007. She is also a 
member of the Georgia Association of Crimi-
nal Defense Lawyers, the National Association 
of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the Amer-
ican Immigration Lawyer Association. Vanessa 
has worked as the owner of her general prac-
tice law firm for criminal defense, family law, 
and immigration defense since 2009. She was 
a recognized mentor in the Georgia State 
Bar’s Transition into the Practice of Law Pro-
gram for many years and has been recog-
nized for her work by the Atlanta Legal Aid 
Society and the Gwinnett Pro Bono Project. 
During her many years practicing the law, she 
has also participated in several teaching en-
gagements in both English and Spanish lan-
guage courses. Vanessa lives in Tucker and 
continues to represent and speak up for peo-
ple in her community every day. 
It is my distinct honor and privilege to recog-
nize three of the many Hispanic Americans 
who work hard every day to make a difference 
in the lives of others in Georgia’s Sixth Con-
gressional District. As we continue to cele-
brate the observation of Hispanic Heritage 
Month, may we recommit to the spirit of serv-
ice demonstrated by these individuals and the 
many others whose stories have yet to be 
told. On behalf of myself, the Sixth Congres-
sional District of Georgia, and the United 
States House of Representatives, I am proud 
to join in the celebration of Hispanic Heritage

HONORING JONATHAN ‘‘J.T.’’ 
TENNANT 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor 20-year veteran harbor 
pilot Jonathan ‘‘J.T.’’ Tennant of Brunswick, 
Georgia, who played a pivotal role in ensuring 
the safety of all crewmembers aboard the 
Golden Ray carrier when it shipwrecked over 
a year ago on September 8, 2019. 
If you visit St. Simons Island in Georgia’s 
First District, it’s hard to miss the Golden Ray, 
which is a 656-foot-long car carrier that re-
mains capsized on the St. Simons Sound. 
As the investigation into the incident by the 
U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board continues, we’ve been 
able to gain valuable insight from crew-
members and others involved. 
Although he had steered a city block-sized 
cargo ship from the Brunswick River to the St. 
Simons Sound several thousand times, noth-
ing could have prepared J.T. for what hap-
pened the morning of September 8. The Gold-
en Ray was sailing normally, but the rudder 
and the propeller came up out of the water to 
where J.T. had no operational control of the 
vessel and it started capsizing rapidly. 
He endured flames melting the steel and 
smoke emanating airboxes the entire length of 
the ship. A testament to his extensive experi-
ence piloting more than 5,000 ships in and out 
of the Port of Brunswick, J.T. drove the Gold-
en Ray as far up on the Sound as possible 
that day to ensure all 23 mariners aboard 
were saved and rescued. 
When you see the giant cargo ship in the 
sound and realize there was no loss of life, it 
is nothing short of a miracle and a testament 
to the hard-working crew—including J.T. 
Although it is an unfortunate situation, I am 
thankful for the courage and determination 
J.T. and the entire crew displayed that day.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF NORTH OAKLAND VFW 
POST 334 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VFW 
Post 334 in Oxford, Michigan. 
Since its founding, VFW Post 334 has 
served the local community in Oxford. Wheth-
er it’s their shelf at the Oxford/Orion FISH food 
pantry, a float in the annual Christmas parade, 
or maintaining the local veterans’ memorial, 
Oxford residents can count on VFW Post 334 
to show up and care. 
VFW Post 334 is committed to making a dif-
ference in the lives of veterans who answered 
the call to serve. By praying for those de-
ployed, supporting their families at home, and 
honoring those who are no longer with us, 
VFW members strengthen the bonds that con-
nect them back to their service. 
For its work, VFW Post 334 was recognized 
in 2019 as a Michigan All-State Post for the 
third year in a row. 
Most recently, it was awarded the Diamond 
Jubilee Award, given to VFW Charters that 
have demonstrated exceptional service for 
three-quarters of a century. 
In closing, I want to thank Quartermaster 
Chuck 
Haskin, 
Senior 
Vice 
Commander 
Randy Stetson, and Post Commander Jim 
Hubbard for their leadership and service to the 
North Oakland community. 
The spirit of VFW Post 334 can be found in 
the closing words of the Commander’s mes-
sage on their web page: ‘‘We honor the dead 
by helping the living.’’ 
I congratulate VFW Post 334 on a success-
ful 75 years and wish them all the best in the 
next 75 years to come.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF GOLF LEGEND, PETE DYE 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of leg-
endary golf course designer Pete Dye. Pete, 
along with his wife Alice, spent a career de-
signing some of the most difficult and well- 
known golf courses across this country and 
the world. This included Crooked Stick Golf 
Club in Carmel, Indiana, where they had a 
home on the 18th hole. The Fifth District, the 
State of Indiana and golfers across the nation 
join his family and friends to mourn the loss of 
Pete Dye. 
Pete Dye grew up in Urbana, Ohio, and 
learned to play golf on a nine-hole course, Ur-
bana Country Club, that his father, Paul Dye— 
a bar owner, insurance agent and post-
master—built after becoming obsessed with 
the game. Dye went on to become a high 
school state champion in Ohio and the Indiana 
State Amateur champion in 1958. He com-
peted in six U.S. Amateurs and even in the 
1957 U.S. Open. Along with being a talented 
golfer, Dye became a successful life insurance 
salesman however, both his and Alice’s pas-
sion for golf led them to golf course design. 
Their first course, the nine hole El Dorado 
course, was built south of Indianapolis. 
Dye went on to design courses in dozens of 
states across the country and in a dozen for-
eign countries. Many of his courses have been 
home to multiple PGA Tour events with some 
of the best players in the world trying to figure 
out the difficult slopes, sand traps and greens. 
Dye was responsible for the design of The 
Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass in Florida, 
home of the iconic ‘‘island green’’ on the 17th 
hole and is one of the most famous of his de-
signs. Dye is well known and respected 
throughout the entire golf community, from 
recreational golfers to the world’s best which 
landed him multiple honors and awards. 
Dye received the Donald Ross Award from 
the American Society of Golf Course Archi-
tects in 1995; the 2003 Old Tom Morris Award 
from the Golf Course Superintendents Asso-
ciation of America; 2004 Distinguished Service 
Award from the PGA of America; and 2005 
PGA TOUR Lifetime Achievement Award. In 
2008, Pete Dye became just the fifth golf ar-
chitect to be inducted into the World Golf Hall 
of Fame. 
Along with his world-renowned golf courses 
and talent for the game of golf, Pete was also 
a loving husband and father. Alice, his wife 
and design partner of 68 years preceded him 
in death. He is survived by his two sons both 
of whom carry on the golf course design leg-
acy: Perry and his wife Ann and P.B. and his 
wife Jean. He is also survived by two grand-
children and two greatgrandchildren. On be-
half of the Fifth District I extend my deepest 
condolences to the Dye family. The people of 
Indiana and golfers throughout the entire world 
will miss Pete, but his courses and legacy will 
live on.

TRIBUTE TO JAI RAJAGOPAL 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
for Jai Rajagopal, a beloved son, brother, 
friend, and organizer who is lost to us far 
soon. On behalf of so many who loved Jai, I 
stand here to mourn. 
Jai was not your ordinary young person, nor 
community member: he was outstanding in ev-
erything he did. When he was only-just old 
enough to vote, Jai dedicated himself to civic 
engagement, beginning with that time honored 
tradition of progress in our nation: voter reg-
istration. When he was 19, he worked on my 
campaign for Congress, where he was adored 
by and inspiring to every member of that 
team, myself included. I am a member of Con-
gress today, because of Jai. 
Ever since, Jai worked ceaselessly for can-
didates, for causes, for the Colorado state leg-
islature, even running for office himself. He 
was seemingly never short of energy for the 
things he believed in. His impacts on our com-
munity will be felt for years to come. 
And, let me tell you, to see Jai’s passion for 
our nation’s progress, in engaging other young 
folks in the democracy his generation is inher-
iting, it was literally awe-inspiring. He was bril-
liant, full-hearted, and courageous, and it was 
an honor to know him. 
Through endless willpower and dedication, 
Jai moved mountains, motivated through the 
assured belief that people were always, al-
ways worth fighting for. 
I count myself incredibly lucky to have 
known Jai. I share my deepest condolences 
with Jai’s mother and brother, to whom he al-
ways credited his intelligence and motivation: 
my thoughts and prayers are with you. 
To all that are mourning Jai, let his memory 
be your motivation in the continued fight for 
justice. 
Rest peacefully, my brother.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, on Friday, 
October 2, 2020, I was not recorded for roll 
call vote 217 and 218. Had I been present, I 
would have voted NAY on the Adoption of H. 
Res. 1153, Condemning unwanted, unneces-
sary medical procedures on individuals without 
their full, informed consent and YEA on the 
Adoption of H. Res. 1154, Condemning 
QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theory it 
promotes. 
I strongly condemn the performance of med-
ical procedures without informed consent. If 
true, these heinous acts deserve swift and ap-
propriate punishment. The allegations raised 
in 
this 
resolution, 
however, 
remain 
unconfirmed as investigations by the Inspector 
General at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity are still underway. I cannot support this 
resolution that assumes the facts are true prior 
to the outcome of complete investigations. 
Furthermore, as a man of faith, I am 
unapologetically pro-life and cannot support 
this resolution that implicitly supports abortion. 
We must always stand for life and protect the 
most vulnerable around us. 
While I support H. Res. 1154, I am disheart-
ened to see the Majority refuse to name simi-
lar leftwing groups, like Antifa, as a part of the 
problem. I fully denounce all such groups and 
their destruction of public and private property 
in our communities.

HUGH PENDLETON NUNNALLY, JR. 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in remembrance of Hugh Pen-
dleton Nunnally, Jr. who was a pillar in the 
Golden Isles community. 
Hugh was born and raised in Atlanta and 
graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in 
agriculture. 
After graduating, he was fortunate enough 
to be mentored by Malon Courts of the Courts 
& Co. and became a broker within 2 years. 
In 1955, he was drafted into the Army and 
finished his service in 1957 as a sergeant. 
Following Hugh’s time in the Army, he be-
came a founding partner in the brokerage firm, 
Budd & Co., and then a founding partner of 
Presidential Financial Co. 
After the death of his precious wife, Miriam, 
he was devoted to many philanthropic efforts, 
including the Southeast Georgia Health Sys-
tem, the Nunnally House, the College of 
Coastal Georgia, The Humane Society of 
South Coastal Georgia, and Hospice of the 
Golden Isles. 
Hugh will always be remembered for his en-
dearing smile, compassion, and selflessness. 
My thoughts and prayers are with all who 
knew and loved him during this most difficult 
time. 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
SERVICE 
AND LEGACY OF JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join my colleagues in recognizing 
the lifetime of service and the legacy of Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
‘‘Fight for the things that you care about, but 
do it in a way that will lead others to join you.’’ 
This insight came from the late Honorable 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and has never been 
more applicable than today. The Notorious 
RBG was a fighter for all and a defender of 
rights until the very end, showing us all the 
true definition of what it means to be a great 
leader. Throughout her career she fought to 
extend fairness and protections for countless 
marginalized groups in this country. 
As a father to young girl and a passionate 
defender of women’s rights, I stand before you 
to reflect on the legacy that Justice Ginsburg 
has left on all generations today, and in the 
years to come. In 1993, Justice Ginsburg was 
appointed to the Supreme Court with unani-
mous support from the Senate and became 
only the second woman ever to serve on the 
highest court in our land. She brought both 
passion and brilliance to her decisions, always 
with the best interests of Americans on her 
mind while upholding our Constitution. 
We have a duty to honor Justice Ginsburg 
by continuing her fight to advance the 
progress she tirelessly worked for during her 
entire career. In a time when my constituents 
and fellow Americans are urgently voicing their 
need for unity and fairness, we must demand 
the very things Justice Ginsburg fought for so 
fiercely: equal health care, reproductive rights, 
equal rights, LGBTQ rights, workers’ rights, 
voting rights, civil rights, and much more. 
So much is at stake with the Supreme Court 
vacancy her passing has created. The Su-
preme Court is already scheduled to hear ar-
guments the week after the election on the 
Trump Administration’s reckless push to de-
stroy the Affordable Care Act (ACA). That 
means, in the middle of this unprecedented 
COVID–19 pandemic, which has killed more 
than 200,000 Americans, the President and 
his allies are trying to pack the Supreme Court 
to take away the health care of millions of 
Americans. This president has promised that 
his Supreme Court nominee will dismantle the 
ACA, so we must take him at his word. 
President Trump and Senate Republicans 
are ignoring the dying wishes of Justice Gins-
burg, the opinion of most Americans, and 
years of precedent in a desperate bid to pack 
the courts to rubberstamp their reckless agen-
da. This is an insult to our Democracy and a 
threat to every American. There should be no 
consideration of a replacement for Justice 
Ginsburg before the next president is sworn 
in. 
We must act now, after Justice Ginsburg’s 
passing, but before a new justice is appointed 
to roll back her legacy and our rights. We 
must take our shared grief and use it as turn-
ing point, drawing on her example as a coura-
geous inspiration for us to all rise up and 
make her proud. We must fight for the rights 
of those who have been ignored or forgotten 
for too long. Justice Ginsburg fought and 
worked hard until the very end, showing us all 
that when love for Country and Constitution 
runs deep, there is no denying justice. 
I urge my Senate Colleagues to honor both 
her and the American people’s wishes.

RECOGNIZING 
OCTOBER 
AS 
NA-
TIONAL SPINE HEALTH AWARE-
NESS MONTH 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to ask that my colleagues join me in 
recognizing October as National Spine Health 
Awareness Month. 100 million Americans, or 
about one third of the U.S. population, suffer 
from neck and back pain each year. Individ-
uals with chronic back pain are four times 
more likely to suffer clinical depression. It is 
the number one non-cancer related reason for 
an opioid prescription in the U.S. It costs $250 
billion to the U.S. economy annually. Back 
pain is the number one cause of job-related 
disability in the U.S. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, many of 
us have been sitting more, eating more, mov-
ing less, and not exercising or visiting the 
gym, all of which contribute to bad backs and 
necks. Many Americans working from home 
have reported experiencing more back pain, 
neck pain, and other musculoskeletal issues. 
Located in my district in Reston, Virginia, 
the National Spine Health Foundation is a 
non-profit dedicated to improving spinal health 
care through education, research, and patient 
advocacy. Their medical research team con-
ducts multi-center studies evaluating innova-
tive approaches to treatments, including re-
generative medicine, minimally invasive ap-
proaches, and non-opioid pain management. 
They educate Americans about treatment and 
prevention and support patients on their jour-
ney to good spinal health, striving to reduce 
the uncertainty and anxiety experienced by all 
those who suffer from neck and back dis-
orders. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing the importance of learn-
ing about good spinal health and in honoring 
those health care providers and organizations 
nationwide that help Americans reach that 
goal not just in October, but all year long.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF UN-
WAVERING ENVIRONMENTAL AD-
VOCATE W. KENT BAILEY 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in tribute to the memory of an un-
wavering environmental advocate, W. Kent 
Bailey. On any decision or issue that touched 
the natural environment of our beautiful 
Tampa Bay and surrounding area, Mr. Bailey 
was always there—steadfast. He came armed 
with science-based facts with an eye to the fu-
ture. He understood how to convey his mes-
sage in unconventional ways to directly con-
vey the urgency, such as carrying a cardboard 
wave cutout to show how high water might 
rise by the end of the century. Mr. Bailey was 
a leader and a supporter of all causes big and 
small that impacted our environment. 
Born in Paris, Kentucky, Mr. Bailey moved 
to Tampa Bay in his early adulthood. By the 
time of his passing on Sept. 22, 2020 at age 
69, he had spent more than 30 years in Flor-
ida. His love for sailing brought sea-level rise 
in Tampa Bay to his attention as he docu-
mented that the actual tide level was usually 
higher than the projected tide level. He be-
came an expert on sea-level rise as well as 
outspoken about it to elected officials and its 
impact in the near future if left unabated. In 
2010, after fighting for the preservation of 
nearly 13,000 acres of land in northeastern 
Hillsborough formerly known as Cone Ranch, 
he became a full-fledged member and leader 
of the Sierra Club, the largest grassroots envi-
ronmental organization in the United States. 
Thanks to Mr. Bailey and the work of others, 
developers were forever blocked from acquir-
ing Cone Ranch, which has become the larg-
est undeveloped tract of land and has since 
been under restoration, slowly opening to the 
public for families and neighbors to enjoy for 
passive activities, such as hiking and horse-
back riding. 
Mr. Bailey owned and operated Bailey & 
Son Woodworking since 1972 but his calling 
was all-things environment. Mr. Bailey served 
as chair of the Tampa Bay Sierra Club for the 
past eight years, engaging and mobilizing 
thousands of members to protect our region 
and state’s fragile, sensitive enviromnental 
lands. He overwhelmingly poured his time and 
energy in deeply studying climate science and 
preparing for the next public presentation or 
protest about it, building his ethos and all for 
the purpose of sustaining a more prosperous 
and equitable future for his 22 grandchildren 
and ours. He was an inspirational speaker and 
motivator, always leading by example and al-
ways giving credit to others and being a 
cheerleader for their contributions. He devel-
oped a strategy of using all angles to fight for 
our environment and affect state policies to 
promote preservation, whether it was orga-
nizing protests, writing letters to the editor or 
creative antics, such as purchasing stock from 
the local power company, Emera Inc., and 
traveling from Florida to Nova Scotia so he 
can vote at the shareholders meeting and in 
protest of expansion plans of a fracked gas fa-
cility in Tampa Bay. 
Mr. Bailey’s legacy will live through his six 
children, grandchildren and wife, Cathy, who 
stood by him in his activism. Madam Speaker, 
our grateful and saddened Tampa Bay com-
munity also pledges to carry forward the work 
of Mr. Bailey. His formidable efforts and self-
less devotion to making Tampa Bay and the 
rest of the United States a better place to live 
are unmatched and are worthy of recognition. 
On behalf of my neighbors in Tampa Bay, 
Florida, and citizens across the United States, 
I am proud to honor W. Kent Bailey for his life-
long dedication to the protection of the envi-
ronment. His legacy as a tireless advocate will 
live on and inspire others in the community for 
many years to come.

IN HONOR OF RUTH BADER GINS-
BURG, 
THE 
‘NOTORIOUS 
RBG,’ 
ASSOCIATE JUDGE OF THE SU-
PREME COURT, FEMINIST ICON 
AND TRAILBLAZER, INSPIRATION 
TO MILLIONS, TIRELESS CHAM-
PION FOR JUSTICE AND FIERCE 
DEFENDER OF THE CONSTITU-
TION 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to join my colleagues during this Special 
Order to honor Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday, Sep-
tember 18, 2020 at the age of 87 years old. 
As a direct beneficiary of her advancement 
of women’s rights and a long-time admirer of 
her vigorous defense of the constitution, I am 
honored but heartbroken to pay tribute to Jus-
tice Ginsburg, an American hero, feminist 
icon, and role model to millions. 
Today, tomorrow, and forever, the American 
people mourn the loss of a true titan, an 
American legend, and an inspiration. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with Ruth’s 
family, friends, and loved ones. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg dedicated her life to 
defending the Constitution and protecting the 
sanctity of America’s democratic ideals, and 
we will forever be indebted to her service to 
this country. 
Joan Ruth Bader, fondly nicknamed Kiki, 
was born on March 15, 1933 to an immigrant 
family and grew up in Brooklyn’s Flatbush 
neighborhood. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg often spoke of her 
mother’s large ambitions for her, and how the 
devastating loss of her mother’s death at an 
early age instilled in her the determination to 
live a life that her mother would have been 
proud of. 
And so, she did. 
Ruth Bader attended Cornell University 
where she met Martin D. Ginsburg, her future 
husband and love of her life to whom she was 
married for 54 years. 
At the age of 21, Ruth Bader graduated Phi 
Beta Kappa from Cornell with a Bachelor of 
Arts degree in Government on June 23, 1954 
and was the highest-ranking female student in 
her graduating class. 
A month after graduating from Cornell, Ruth 
and Martin were married and moved to Fort 
Sill, Oklahoma, where Martin was stationed as 
a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps officer in 
the U.S. Army Reserve after his call-up to ac-
tive duty. 
To help support the family, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg worked for the Social Security Ad-
ministration office in Oklahoma, where she 
was demoted after becoming pregnant with 
her first child, Jane, who was born in 1955. 
In the fall of 1956, Ruth Bader Ginsburg en-
rolled at Harvard Law School, where she was 
one of only 9 women in a class of about 500 
men. 
Harvard Law Dean Erwin Griswold report-
edly invited all the female law students to din-
ner at his family home and asked the female 
law students, including Ginsburg, ‘‘Why are 
you at Harvard Law School, taking the place 
of a man?’’ 
When her husband took a job in New York 
City, Ruth Bader Ginsburg transferred to Co-
lumbia Law School and became the first 
woman to be on two major law reviews: Har-
vard Law Review and Columbia Law Review. 
In 1959, she earned her law degree at Co-
lumbia and tied for first in her class but de-
spite these enviable credentials and distin-
guished record of excellence, no law firm in 
New York City would hire her as a lawyer be-
cause she was a woman. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a crusader for 
women’s rights and an unstoppable force who 
transformed the law and defied social conven-
tion. 
Her now infamous quote, ‘‘I ask no favor for 
my sex; all I ask of our brethren is that they 
take their feet off our necks’’, was a personal 
mantra for the Justice as it characterized her 
fight for and pursuit of equal rights throughout 
her lifetime. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, later affectionately 
known as the ‘Notorious RBG,’ was as instru-
mental and historically significant to the cause 
of women’s rights as was Thurgood Marshall 
to the cause of civil rights for African Ameri-
cans. 
As a young lawyer and Director of the 
Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated 
six landmark cases before the Supreme Court, 
winning five out of the six cases. 
Like Justice Marshall, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg’s uncanny strategic instincts and careful 
selection of cases were vital in her persuasion 
of the all-male Supreme Court to start disman-
tling the legal institution of sex discrimination 
one case at a time. 
In 1975, Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated and 
won Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, which would 
become a landmark case in antidiscrimination 
jurisprudence. 
In this case, the widower had been denied 
survivor benefits, which would allow him to 
stay at home and raise his son, based on a 
Social Security provision that assumed only 
women were secondary providers with unim-
portant incomes. 
While some questioned Ginsburg’s choice to 
challenge instances of sex discrimination by 
representing a male plaintiff, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg saw it as an opportunity to show the 
court that childcare was not a sex-determined 
role to be performed only by women. 
As with many of her cases, her goal was to 
free both sexes, men as well as women, from 
the roles that society had assigned them and 
to harness the Constitution to break down the 
structures by which the state maintained and 
enforced those separate spheres. 
As Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued to chal-
lenge the stereotypical assumptions of what 
was considered to be women’s work and

men’s work, she was able to persuade the 
Court and the nation that discriminating on the 
basis of sex was not only wrong but also a 
violation of the 14th Amendment of the Con-
stitution, which guarantees equal protection to 
all citizens under the law. 
As the courts began to recognize the chang-
ing roles of men and women, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was able to advance gender equality 
with the understanding that women are capa-
ble of being heads of households or sole pro-
viders for their family. 
In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, 
making her the second woman to fill this posi-
tion. 
This historic appointment further symbolized 
the principle that women were equal to men in 
every respect, that they could have successful 
careers and also could, if they chose, be de-
voted wives or mothers, thereby breaking bar-
riers for generations of women to follow in her 
footsteps. 
In fact, many of Ginsburg’s opinions helped 
solidify the constitutional protections she had 
fought so hard to establish decades earlier. 
While we commemorate Justice Ginsburg’s 
work for advancing the women’s movement 
both as a Justice and as a lawyer, all are in 
her debt who cherish the progress made in 
the areas of LGBTQ+ equality, immigration re-
form, environmental justice, voting rights, pro-
tections for people with disabilities, and so 
much more. 
Throughout her life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
worked to make the law work so that America 
would be more just, equitable, fairer, and bet-
ter for all. 
Whether it be in her legendary dissenting 
opinions or as leader when in the majority, 
Justice Ginsburg continued to advocate for the 
marginalized and most vulnerable. 
In recent years, she may not have been 
able to control the outcome of the rulings, but 
she grew bolder in her dissents, often stating 
what should have been the outcome. 
Throughout her tenure on the bench, Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg displayed her rigorous and in-
cisive legal mind and employed her formidable 
skills as a consensus builder, but she could be 
tough and forceful when the moment de-
manded. 
Nothing illustrates this better than her fa-
mous dissent in Shelby County v. Holder, in 
which the 5–to–4 majority negated the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 by invalidating section 4 of 
the law, which neutralized section 5, the provi-
sion of the act that required jurisdictions with 
a history of racial and ethnic discrimination in 
voting to obtain preclearance from the federal 
government before any changes in voting pro-
cedures, from polling stations to voter photo 
IDs could go into effect. 
It was in her scathing dissent Justice Gins-
burg stated, ‘‘Hubris is a fit word for today’s 
demolition of the VRA’’ and that the majority’s 
logic was akin to ‘‘throwing away your um-
brella in a rainstorm because you are not get-
ting wet.’’ 
Unlike the others, Justice Ginsburg was 
able to see the ramifications of the ruling and 
its allowances for reinvigorated efforts of voter 
suppression. 
Today, I join millions of individuals who are 
mourning the loss of this legal giant, feminist, 
and trailblazer. 
Justice Ginsburg loved this country, so 
much so that she served the nation while en-
during illnesses and undergoing treatments 
that would have incapacitated lesser mortals. 
She inspired generations of women then 
and now to shatter glass ceilings, and her leg-
acy will inspire new generations of women in 
the years to come. 
As the news of her passing continues to re-
verberate across the country and around the 
world, it is important that we remember and 
honor what she stood for and continue fighting 
to realize the goal of equal justice under law. 
I am honored to be able to pay tribute to the 
memory of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, the ‘Notorious RBG,’ one of the 
greatest jurists in our nation’s history, a tire-
less and unyielding champion for equal justice, 
and a fierce defender of the Constitution.

JOHN DORMINEY PAULK III 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor the life of 
Mr. John Dorminey Paulk III of Georgia’s First 
Congressional District, who recently passed 
away at the age of 85. 
He was a teacher, mentor, and friend to 
countless people, so he was often referred to 
as the ‘‘Mayor of Jekyll.’’ 
He loved to enjoy the many golfing opportu-
nities on the island so much that he eventually 
became a teaching golf professional at the re-
nowned East Lake Country Club in Atlanta, 
Georgia. 
In 1965, he was one of four local qualifiers 
in the U.S. Open in Atlanta. 
Two years later, he became Jekyll Island’s 
Head Golf Professional and was eventually in-
ducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame. 
He was such a devoted and accomplished 
golfer that tournaments were named in his 
honor, including the ‘‘Johnny Paulk Invita-
tional’’ and the ‘‘Johnny Paulk Two Man Clas-
sic.’’ 
He has shown what it means to be a great 
ambassador for Jekyll Island and the game of 
golf. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family, 
friends, and all who knew him during this most 
difficult time.

FAREWELL LETTER FROM U.S. 
REP. TOM GRAVES (R–GA–14) 
HON. TOM GRAVES 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 2, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
when I was young, my Dad always used to tell 
me that if I dreamed big and worked hard, I 
would achieve much. Dream Big, Work Hard, 
Achieve Much. I have carried that advice with 
me my entire life. Those words fueled my abil-
ity to go from the hall of a single-wide trailer 
to the halls of Congress. 
I write that today as I reflect on what makes 
America so special: the ability to chart your 
own course and achieve any dream. My heart 
is filled with gratitude for our country and the 
enduring experiment of democracy that has al-
lowed someone like me to end up in the U.S. 
House of Representatives for the past decade. 
Serving as the Representative of Georgia’s 
9th and 14th districts has truly been the honor 
of my life. This privilege was made possible by 
the sacrifice and support of so many wonder-
ful people. First and foremost, my parents ‘‘Big 
Tom’’ and Penny; my wife, Julie; my children, 
Josephine, John, and Janey. My family has 
supported me every step of the way on this 
path of public service. My wife and children 
bore a burden that often goes unrecognized in 
politics. There are many precious days of life 
that we spent apart. Knowing their sacrifice 
motivated me every day to do the very best I 
could. Now it’s time to shift the focus to them, 
and support their journeys and dreams, just as 
they supported mine. 
For my final words entered into the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD as a member of Con-
gress, I want to share the most essential les-
son learned over the past decade: the impor-
tance of relationship building. Tone, rhetoric 
and civility are crucial to opening doors to new 
and unexpected relationships with lawmakers 
from across the political spectrum. Often the 
best policies are the product of broad perspec-
tives and creativity, with input from people 
who bring experience from different walks of 
life. 
I can think of no better embodiment of that 
ideal than the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress. Committee members 
hail from opposite sides of the country, with 
different professional backgrounds and life ex-
periences. Regardless of our political and per-
sonal differences, our commitment to those we 
serve—our constituents—came first. The way 
our committee operated should serve as a 
model for this institution. Our bipartisan col-
laboration resulted in 97 recommendations to 
make the legislative branch work better. I 
hope that this work continues, because the 
American people deserve an institution that is 
as forward thinking and innovative as they are. 
Bipartisan relationships are at the heart of 
anything that can become law, and the Amer-
ican people are far better off when we connect 
over shared goals and work together to ac-
complish them. 
Serving on the Select Committee is the per-
fect capstone to my career in public service. I 
am grateful to my partner, Chair Derek Kilmer 
of Washington, for his outstanding leadership. 
Nothing the committee produced would have 
been possible without Chair Kilmer’s bipartisan 
approach and boundless passion for our work. 
I am also grateful to Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY 
of California for appointing me Vice Chair of 
the committee. It was truly an honor to be 
chosen from the pool of talented members I 
serve alongside. 
I am also filled with gratitude for my staff, 
who have delivered incredible service to my 
constituents and the country. These are peo-
ple with a heart for public service, who truly 
care for our nation. I saw tremendous sac-
rifices made: long hours, late nights, the bur-
den of stress and pressure that comes with 
the weight of the work, whether it was secur-
ing life-saving veterans benefits for one per-
son or passing a policy that affects millions of 
Americans. My team carried themselves in 
such a way that it was clear they knew the 
honor and privilege of working for the U.S. 
House. 
In my tenure, I had two chiefs of staff: Tim 
Baker and John Patrick Donnelly, They led our
