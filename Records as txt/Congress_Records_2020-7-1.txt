HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
GUNTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and honor the life 
of the mayor of Salinas, California, Joe 
Gunter. 
Mayor Gunter passed on Monday 
after a quick bout, unfortunately, with 
cancer. 
Mayor Gunter was a true public serv-
ant, who truly understood what it 
means and what it takes to live up to 
our obligations as Americans—to give 
back to his country and community— 
that gives all of us so much. 
Right out of high school, Mayor Gun-
ter joined the Marines where he served 
and fought in Vietnam. Right out of 
his service to our country, Mayor Gun-
ter joined the Salinas Police Depart-
ment where he proudly served and pro-
tected for 32 years. 
And right out of that service to our 
community, Mayor Gunter then volun-
teered at a Women’s Crisis Center, in 
youth sports, for the Salinas Air Show, 
and the California Rodeo. 
But that wasn’t enough. Because 
right out of retirement, Joe then 
served as mayor of Salinas for the past 
8 years. And I can tell you, as Mayor 
Joe knew well that it really wasn’t 
about the snarkiness of your tweets, it 
is about making government work for 
people. 
Joe would tell you he wasn’t much 
for politics, but when it came to serv-
ing the people of Salinas, Mayor Gun-
ter was the best. Because Joe knew 
dang well that good governing is good 
politics. 
My prayers are with his wife, Lisa, 
his children, and his grandchildren. I 
hope they take comfort knowing that 
although Joe will be missed, his legacy 
of service will always endure with the 
people of this country and the commu-
nity of Salinas, California. 
f 
SIDNEY AND KINSEY IRRIGATION 
DISTRICTS 
SHOULD 
NOT 
LOSE 
POWER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, the 
Sidney and Kinsey Irrigation Districts 
serve more than 130 family farms that 
irrigate nearly 12,000 acres of farmland 
in eastern Montana. 
A recent decision by the Bureau of 
Reclamation has upended 70 years of 
how Sidney and Kinsey irrigators have 
received project use power to pump 
water. 
The change will increase power costs 
from 2.5 percent of their annual budget 
to nearly 40 percent. 
Losing this power would put these 
family farmers and companies out of 
business. 
My amendment will fix this issue by 
restoring the original arrangement 
that has been in place for 70 years. 
I urge support for it. 
MONTANA SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELL ITS COAL 
OVERSEAS 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, Mon-
tana should be able to sell its coal 
overseas. 
Washington State is preventing con-
struction of coal export terminals, ef-
fectively shutting down exports of 
Montana coal and unconstitutionally 
interfering with interstate commerce. 
My amendment will continue the 
Federal permitting process if Wash-
ington State remains on its unconsti-
tutional path. 
Building a coal port that supports 
good-paying union jobs in Washington 
and good-paying jobs across Montana 
should be a bipartisan winner. 
I urge adoption of this amendment. 
f 
TWO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO THE 
CRISIS AMERICANS ARE FACING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
MR. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
the longer I am here the more I ques-
tion why everything must be so com-
plex. Some, like our transportation 
bill, are complex because of the mas-
sive interrelationships we have, but 
others we just make complex. 
I would offer two simple solutions 
today to the crisis that we are facing, 
not just from Black Americans, for jus-
tice. First, I would suggest that we re-
move the dead hand of Richard Nixon

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2986 
July 1, 2020 
from the scales of justice with his cyn-
ical, cruel war on drugs, which con-
tinues to this day. 
Tens of thousands of young Black 
Americans are arrested or cited still 
for something that two-thirds of Amer-
icans think should be legal; and, in 
fact, voters in 10 States have done so. 
We are watching how these inter-
actions with police with young people 
for something that even a majority of 
Republicans now say should be legal 
can lead to tragic consequences. Why 
do we do this? 
We have an opportunity before us 
now with legislation approved by the 
House Judiciary Committee, the MORE 
Act, which incorporates many ele-
ments 
of 
Congresswoman 
BARBARA 
LEE’s Marijuana Justice Act, which 
would just legalize marijuana, what 
the majority of American people want, 
what is happening in States across the 
country, and prevent this opportunity 
for interference with law enforcement 
that is completely unjustified. Com-
pletely unjustified. 
I suggest that there is another simple 
action to deal with a century of dis-
crimination dealing with housing spe-
cifically against people of color. I spent 
most of last summer and fall doing a 
deep dive into American housing pol-
icy. I have a report on my website: 
‘‘LOCKED 
OUT. 
Reversing 
Federal 
Housing Failures and Unlocking Oppor-
tunity.’’ 
But what I found dealing with this is 
a tragic, embarrassing record of bla-
tant discrimination by the Federal 
Government against people of color, es-
pecially Black Americans. 
Look at the history of the Federal 
Government denying them housing for 
wartime work projects, for redlining, 
denying applications for New Deal 
housing projects, excluding African 
Americans. And an example of some-
thing that I just recently became 
aware of, the 1968 Housing and Urban 
Development Act, which had good in-
tentions and generous terms, but gave 
way to predatory inclusion where real 
estate interests, banks sold essentially 
deficient properties at terms that unso-
phisticated buyers did not fully under-
stand. But the banks and real estate 
interests didn’t care because the loans 
were guaranteed by the Federal Gov-
ernment at inflated prices. Banking 
and real estate interests were able to 
take those back, flip them, sell them 
again. It is a shameful chapter in this 
century-long process of discriminating 
against African Americans in housing. 
I would suggest that when we look at 
what we might do, some are thinking 
about reparations, I suggest we just 
provide generous rental subsidies and 
loan terms for Black Americans. Think 
of it as a GI Bill for Black Americans 
who endured a century of discrimina-
tion and denying them the access to 
wealth that has built much of the 
White middle class. 
I would respectfully suggest that this 
is long overdue. It is justified. It would 
help stop some of the free-fall in hous-
ing markets that is moving forward 
and could lead to the same economic 
burst of energy that we saw after 
World War II for the GI Bill, which too 
many Black Americans were denied. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE RIGHT TO 
BEAR ARMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my strong support for our Sec-
ond Amendment as protected by the 
United States Constitution. 
The right to bear arms shall never be 
infringed upon, and I will always de-
fend that right on this very floor. 
I swore an oath to serve the people of 
Indiana’s 
Sixth 
District, 
and 
that 
means fighting for the God-given right 
of all Americans to defend themselves 
and their property. The right to defend 
yourself and protect your loved ones is 
paramount now more than ever. 
IN SUPPORT OF LIFE 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to give voice to those who do not have 
one: The unborn children of America. 
I am a pro-life American. It is our 
duty to protect the most vulnerable 
among us. Every human being deserves 
a right to life, and I will always defend 
that right. As I stand in this Chamber 
today, I pledge to always fight for the 
fundamental right to live given to us 
by God. 
SUPPORT MAIN STREET 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to urge my colleagues to support Main 
Street as our economy reopens. 
Across 
this 
Nation 
mom-and-pop 
shops are suffering. 
The COVID–19 pandemic, combined 
with extreme social unrest, has caused 
businesses everywhere to shut their 
doors, many of which may never open 
again. 
As we reopen, American jobs may be 
lost permanently. 
Congress must make it a priority to 
protect and support small business 
owners and workers. 
It is our duty to do the people’s work 
here in the people’s House in our Na-
tion’s capital. 
Congress must support the Ameri-
cans we swore to represent. 
IN SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my support for our brave law 
enforcement officers. 
Behind the badge and uniform of our 
men and women in blue are neighbors 
and friends who put their lives on the 
line every day to protect the citizens 
they serve. 
Defunding the police would be down-
right dangerous, and I will never sup-
port that. 
Further, some are advocating to 
change qualified immunity. 
Eliminating 
this 
civil 
protection 
would have disastrous implications. 
It would open up officers and their 
families to countless civil lawsuits and 
make community policing all but im-
possible. 
In these times, the heroes of law en-
forcement deserve more support, not 
less. 
AMERICANS NEED A STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE 
BILL TO REVIVE OUR ECONOMY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice opposition to H.R. 2. 
Americans across this Nation need a 
strong infrastructure bill to revive and 
strengthen our economy now. 
Yet Democrats drafted this bill with-
out any Republican input. 
Commonsense, bipartisan proposals 
like the 12 amendments I authored 
failed because this is not a serious ef-
fort. This bill is a progressive wish list 
and a NANCY PELOSI power grab again. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 
2. 
WISHING GOOD LUCK TO 4–H PARTICIPANTS 
ACROSS INDIANA 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, as the fair 
season begins, I want to wish the best 
of luck to all 4–H’rs across Indiana’s 
Sixth District. 
Though this year’s fairs are virtual 
and may look very different, the hard 
work they have put in throughout this 
past year I want to recognize. 
4–H is a tremendous organization 
that helps our Nation’s youth develop 
the life skills needed to empower them-
selves and their communities. 
Best of luck to those participating in 
their 4–H county fair. You are making 
your families and communities very 
proud.

MODERNIZING 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
IS IMPORTANT TO ALL AMERI-
CANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, like 
many Members of Congress, I came de-
termined to increase long-term Federal 
investment in infrastructure. 
Supporting the movement of people, 
goods, 
energy, 
and 
information 
through our infrastructure is crucial to 
driving investment in our communities 
and maintaining America’s economic 
competitiveness. 
Modernizing our infrastructure is im-
portant to Americans in every part of 
the country. We know that infrastruc-
ture projects are consistently evalu-
ated as the best return on government 
investment. 
b 0915 
As a member of the New Democratic 
Coalition, we believe any new proposal 
must include new revenue, new financ-
ing, 
new 
funding, 
and 
regulatory 
streamlining and encourage lifecycle 
funding in innovative infrastructure 
projects that are built to last. 
As chair of the New Democrat Coali-
tion Infrastructure Task Force and a 
member of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee, I believe that 
there should be four pillars for infra-
structure deals. Those include revenue 
funding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2987 
July 1, 2020 
I support securing dedicated, sustain-
able revenue to keep the Highway 
Trust Fund solvent well into the future 
and increasing Federal investment that 
is not looted for other purposes. 
We need a variety of funding options, 
including mileage-based user fees; rais-
ing or indexing the gas tax; user fees 
on electric vehicles or batteries to cre-
ate parity with gasoline-powered vehi-
cles; slightly increasing the corporate 
tax rate and dedicating the incre-
mental revenue gains toward infra-
structure, both expanded and new bond 
programs. 
We must think strategically and use 
lifecycle cost analysis to account for 
the operating and maintenance needs 
of an asset across its entire lifecycle. 
Thus, we will help guard against de-
ferred maintenance. 
I support investing seed capital to 
capitalize an infrastructure bank that 
would leverage its funds for everything 
from roads, to water, to broadband 
projects. The bank would be accessible 
to 
States, 
localities, 
and 
regional 
groups and would be able to loan them 
money with favorable terms as well as 
offer bond insurance. 
I and the task force support grant 
programs that would specifically tar-
get areas in desperate need of revital-
izing their infrastructure, including 
those recovering from natural disas-
ters, communities with higher rates of 
unemployment and poverty, and rural 
areas. That means new avenues to fund 
infrastructure projects in communities 
that have been left behind and in areas 
that traditionally struggle to attract 
infrastructure funding for projects that 
have holistic community support. 
The task force recognizes the impor-
tance of continued regulatory stream-
lining in a way that balances expedited 
construction with appropriate environ-
mental and safety safeguards. The ad-
ministration must work to implement 
the numerous streamlining provisions 
already passed into law by Congress in 
the FAST Act transportation bill. 
In addition, I support encouraging 
the use of regional partnerships and 
public-private partnerships. 
We must also think about broadband 
and realize that this is the new trans-
portation of the 21st century, making 
sustainable and innovative public and 
private investments across the U.S. to 
repair and upgrade existing assets and 
build vital new projects. 
We must seek to support projects 
that help communities become more 
energy efficient, resilient, and better 
prepared to deal with the impact of cli-
mate change and environmental clean-
up. 
Finally, we must seek to give com-
munities ownership of local develop-
ment and encourage innovation, regu-
latory streamlining, and more com-
prehensive 
multiproject 
long-term 
planning. 
PROVIDING RESOURCES TO 
REOPEN SAFELY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, the over-
whelming majority of constituents in 
my district are eager to get back to 
work, and I believe it is Congress’ duty, 
our duty, to ensure that our citizens 
have the necessary resources to reopen 
in a safe and responsible way. That is 
why I am proud to have introduced two 
bills that focus on this very need. 
The SAFE at Work Act would create 
a tax credit for businesses that allow 
their employees to work from home. 
This not only protects employees and 
employers 
against 
the 
spread 
of 
COVID–19 but also encourages employ-
ers to create telework opportunities for 
those most susceptible to the virus. 
I also introduced the KEEP Act, 
which supports the President’s push for 
a 3-month payroll tax holiday. This ini-
tiative would allow millions of Ameri-
cans to keep more of the money that 
they already earn, thus providing crit-
ical capital to weather this crisis with-
out involving Federal bureaucracy. 
No government program, no matter 
how generous, can replace a func-
tioning 
economy. 
These 
measures 
would support hardworking Americans’ 
efforts to get our economy back on 
track, so I urge their immediate adop-
tion. 
HIGHLIGHTING BORDER WALL EFFECTIVENESS 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
lend my voice to the fight to protect 
our Nation by securing its borders. 
Since arriving in Congress, I have 
stood by the President and his efforts 
to protect our children from traf-
fickers, dealers, terrorists, and other 
criminal elements by building a wall. 
For decades, our porous borders have 
threatened our national security, and 
it wasn’t until President Trump took 
office that our government took this 
threat seriously. 
Just how effective has the wall been? 
It is a fact that nearly 1 million peo-
ple were stopped at the U.S.-Mexico 
border in 2019, but in the last 12 
months, illegal immigration has been 
down 84 percent and illegal crossings 
from Central America are down 97 per-
cent. 
It is a fact that President Trump has 
deported over 6,000 MS–13 gang mem-
bers. 
And it is a fact that this barrier be-
tween the countries is helping stop the 
flow of illicit drugs. Nearly 450,000 
pounds have been seized this year 
alone. 
For far too long, too many have ig-
nored the facts, but I haven’t, and I 
will continue doing everything I can do 
to keep Florida 15 residents and its 
businesses safe. 
HONORING SERGEANT ANDREW BOSKO 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Andrew Bosko, a 
Lakeland, Florida, World War II vet-
eran who is 98 years young. 
Andy was born in Ohio, raised in 
Pennsylvania, and one of 13 children of 
immigrant parents from Austria and 
Czechoslovakia. 
He entered the Army Air Corps in 
1943, assigned to the VII Fighter Com-
mand in Hawaii. In 1945, the command 
was reassigned to Iwo Jima, which had 
been seized by Marine units, to provide 
emergency landing fields supporting 
bombing operations against Japan. 
Meanwhile, his wife and true love, 
Sophia, was supporting the war as a 
Rosie the Riveter. Yet, they still found 
time to write to each other each day. 
Following the war, Andy worked as a 
machinist in New York and later 
launched some of Lakeland’s favorite 
restaurants. 
Andy, you, together with your bride 
of 74 years, represent the greatest of 
our Greatest Generation. You experi-
enced economic and social turmoil and 
a World War, and then you rebuilt our 
Nation into the greatest on Earth. 
It is our honor to serve you, as you, 
for so many years, have served us. 
SALUTING ELLA ERICKSON, VETERAN OF THE 
MONTH 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to share the inspiring story of a 
World War II veteran from Lakeland, 
Florida. 
At 100 years young, Ella Erickson is 
a unique personification of what her-
oism is about. 
Raised in Wisconsin, she joined the 
U.S. Marine Corps in 1943. Following 
basic training, she reported to Marine 
Corps Headquarters here in Wash-
ington, and for the next 2 years, Staff 
Sergeant 
Erickson 
maintained 
the 
records of Marine prisoners of war. 
Discharged at the end of the war, 
Ella married and began her family and 
career. 
While holding demanding jobs at 
Wheaton College and as a nurse caring 
for the ailing, she also found time to be 
a supportive wife to international 
evangelist Victor Erickson and raise 
four children, two of whom went on to 
serve in the U.S. Air Force. 
She has been a hero to the sick and 
to our Nation and an even greater one 
to her family. She epitomizes what her-
oism is all about, sacrificial service. 
Thank you, Ella. Thank you for serv-
ing us and showing us how to live well. 
On behalf of Florida 15, I salute you.

Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as a father, an American, and a 
Congressman in support of H.R. 1425,

lymphoma when she was just 14 years 
old. 
Parents and children who have been 
through the fear, the hospitalizations, 
the chemotherapy, and the years of 
anxiety-evoking follow-ups know the 
nightmare all too well because they 
have lived it. 
But Pia and our family are among 
the lucky ones. She survived cancer 
and is now a thriving 20-year-old pur-
suing her college studies. 
And I know how lucky I was to be at 
Pia’s bedside during the toughest days 
and to do so without worrying about 
how I was going to pay her medical 
bills. 
I know, in fact, we all know that this 
is not the case for too many American 
families throughout our country. 
We need this legislation because it 
will lower healthcare costs, costs that 
are the very highest in the entire 
world, yet our outcomes are mid-pack. 
In the United States of America, we 
should have the highest quality care in 
the world, the most efficient delivery 
of care in the world, and the best value 
in the world. In the United States of 
America, the wealthiest nation in the 
entire world, no one should have to 
choose between seeing their doctor or 
seeing food on their table—no one. 
I rise today as an American because 
healthcare is patriotic. I am sick and 
tired of Americans paying more money 
for less quality than other nations. 
And I am sick and tired of Americans 
paying more money for the very same 
lifesaving medications than patients in 
other countries. 
Americans are getting ripped off, and 
we, every single one of us in this Cham-
ber, can do something about it. Ensur-
ing that every American has access to 
high-quality and affordable healthcare 
and medications is indeed a moral deci-
sion, but it is also an economic deci-
sion. 
Let’s not kid ourselves. We do not 
have a healthcare system in our coun-
try; we have a sick care system. And it 
is not even a system, which has made 
the epic failure of our Nation’s COVID 
response even more glaring. 
You see, we tolerate, even condone, 
incentives for procedures over preven-
tion and profit over people. It is cost-
ing us billions of dollars and bank-
rupting thousands of families and, 
surely, costing American lives. 
We need this legislation because 
there is meaningful economic and soci-
etal value in ensuring that every 
American enjoys healthcare coverage 
no matter their age, their race, their 
gender, their ZIP Code, their income, 
or their condition. 
I rise today as a Congressman be-
cause finding common ground, building 
consensus, 
and 
fixing 
our 
broken 
healthcare system is my job. I am on a 
mission to inspire collaboration in this 
Chamber and restore Americans’ faith 
in government, and I cannot imagine a 
better place to begin than healthcare. 
Let’s rise to this moment and im-
prove it together. 
Mr. Speaker, we need this legislation 
because it will help all Americans, not 
red State or blue State Americans, but 
all Americans. 
We need this legislation because no 
one in this country, Republican, Demo-
crat, independent, or otherwise, thinks 
that our healthcare system is working. 
We need this legislation because 
healthcare is collective, and this pan-
demic presents an extraordinary oppor-
tunity to build a true health system in 
this country. COVID–19 has taught us 
that one’s health and well-being are di-
rectly dependent on the health and 
well-being of one’s entire community. 
We are in this together, and we must 
take care of one another together. 
We need this legislation because 
whether it is my daughter, Pia, a can-
cer survivor, or Cindy with diabetes in 
Eden Prairie or Nikki with MS in 
Brooklyn Park or every single mother 
in our country who has ever given birth 
to a child, preexisting conditions are 
part of being human and should never 
be a barrier to care. 
We need to pass this legislation be-
cause it is personal, it is patriotic, and 
it is our job. 
I am grateful to my colleagues in 
this House for doing so yesterday, and 
I call on our colleagues in the Senate 
to join us in ensuring a healthier and 
more equitable future for every single 
American.

HONORING GEORGIA STATE 
SENATOR JACK HILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and to 
honor the life of one of my mentors and 
my very good friend, Georgia State 
Senator Jack Hill, who passed away on 
April 6 at the age of 75. 
I sat next to Jack in the Georgia 
State Senate for 5 years, and he was 
truly a mentor to me. Through listen-
ing and interacting with him over the 
course of those years up until his 
death, I understood what it really 
meant to be a dedicated public servant. 
Jack 
lived 
his 
entire 
life 
in 
Reidsville, and his love for his home-
town and community was evident 
throughout his life. 
After he graduated from Reidsville 
High School and Georgia Southern Uni-
versity, he came back to his hometown 
and went into the grocery business as 
owner and operator of Hill Shopping 
Center. 
In addition to running his own suc-
cessful business, Jack still found time 
to serve in the Georgia Air National 
Guard for over 33 years, both as a unit 
commander and a State inspector gen-
eral. 
He was appointed to the board of di-
rectors at The Tattnall Bank in the 
early 1980s before heeding the call to 
public service. 
In 1990, he ran for and won his first 
term as Georgia State Senator for the 
Fourth District of Georgia. 
Throughout Jack’s 30 years of stead-
fast service in representing the Fourth 
District, he served on many prestigious 
committees, 
including 
the 
Senate 
Rules Committee, where he was vice 
chairman, and chairman of the power-
ful Senate Appropriations Committee. 
Both Jack and I liked to write col-
umns. We would write weekly columns. 
Jack always chided me and said mine 
were very chatty. I always chided him 
and said his were very nerdy. 
b 0930 
He was a numbers cruncher. He knew 
the budget like no one in the State of 
Georgia knew it. He was always the 
last to leave the capitol each day be-
cause of how dedicated he was to serve 
the people of our State. 
Because of Jack’s leadership, my col-
leagues and I were always driven to be 
good stewards of taxpayer dollars and 
uphold our mission in all that we did to 
serve Georgians to the best of our abili-
ties. 
Jack was a man of overwhelming in-
tegrity, compassion, and humility. He 
was a true statesman. While he cer-
tainly worked hard to be selected for 
this role, he never used his prestigious 
title to gain praise or acknowledgment. 
He was one of the few people who 
taught me the importance of placing 
people over the politics and praise. If 
anyone ever needed to talk to him, he 
was always available and listened to 
what you had to say no matter who 
you were. 
Jack also taught me the importance 
of humility and keeping a common, 
steady hand at the helm. I will always 
remember his immense dedication to 
everyone he interacted with. 
He made a huge difference in the 
lives of countless students, in the rep-
utation of the university system, and 
in the holistic improvement of the 
State of Georgia. 
Jack’s legacy will always be remem-
bered, and those he knew will never 
forget the impact he had on the lives 
he touched. 
It is for these reasons that all 14 
Georgia Members of the U.S. House, in-
cluding myself, signed proposed legisla-
tion to name a post office building in 
Jack’s hometown of Reidsville after 
him. Naming a post office after him 
will honor his remarkable contribu-
tions to our State for years to come, 
and we will work to preserve his legacy 
of public service for his fellow Geor-
gians. 
Jack’s advice has stayed with me 
throughout the years, and he helped 
make me the person I am today. I am 
forever grateful to have known Jack 
Hill, and I will never forget him. His 
family, friends, and those he worked 
with 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
in 
my 
thoughts and prayers as we all mourn 
the death of a great Georgian and a 
great American.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2989 
July 1, 2020 
peacefully on June 9, 2020, at the age of 
90. 
A lifelong resident of Sandersville, 
Georgia, 
Mr. 
Tarbutton’s 
ambition 
started at an earlier age when he 
earned the honor of Eagle Scout. He 
even attended the Boy Scout Inter-
national Jamboree in Paris, France, in 
1947. 
Mr. Tarbutton went on to attend Ox-
ford College and graduated from Emory 
University in 1951 with a BA in eco-
nomics. Following his studies, Mr. 
Tarbutton served our Nation in the 
U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1955 and was a 
veteran of the Korean war. 
When he returned home, he began his 
lifelong career with the Sandersville 
Railroad 
Company. 
Mr. 
Tarbutton 
served as a director of the American 
Short Line and Regional Railroad As-
sociation, which is now 127 years old. 
He dedicated 65 years to the company 
until the time of his death, serving as 
president, vice president, and director. 
His strong commitment to the rail-
road 
industry 
stretched 
beyond 
Sandersville Railroad Company. Mr. 
Tarbutton served as the director of the 
American Short Line and Regional 
Railroad Association and founder and 
president of the Georgia Railroad Asso-
ciation. 
While he found great success in busi-
ness, Mr. Tarbutton is best known for 
his commitment to his family, his 
church, and his community and the 
State of Georgia. 
He will always be remembered for his 
tireless work to bring new industry and 
jobs to Sandersville. As part of this 
work, he served as the director of the 
Washington County Chamber of Com-
merce for many years and was honored 
as Washington County’s Citizen of the 
Year. 
But 
most 
importantly, 
Mr. 
Tarbutton was a family man. His 
friends and family remember him as a 
wonderful storyteller who entertained 
everyone around him with his colorful 
tales. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
the Tarbutton family, especially his 
widow, Nancy, with a debt of gratitude 
for sharing Mr. Ben with all of us.

DISMANTLE WHITE SUPREMACY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, a week 
ago, this body acted to bring justice to 
our communities to begin the uncom-
fortable, urgent work of dismantling 
white supremacy wherever it finds 
shelter. 
But our work is far from finished. 
In the days since we passed the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a 
young biracial woman named Althea 
Bernstein was set on fire by four White 
men as she sat in her car. 
Three police officers from North 
Carolina were fired after they laughed 
about slaughtering Black people. 
The President of the United States 
proudly promoted a video of one of his 
supporters shouting ‘‘white power’’ at 
protesters. 
Mr. Speaker, if we fail to meet this 
moment to enact the change demanded 
by millions of Americans of all colors, 
all creeds, all beliefs, the damage to 
this institution and to our Nation will 
be immense. 
This body was built to be a reflection 
of the people whom we represent. They 
have 
the 
courage 
to 
create 
that 
change. So should we. 
f 
SHIPPING MEAT ACROSS STATE 
LINES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, during this COVID–19 pan-
demic, ag producers and consumers 
across the country have suffered as we 
have seen the cracks in our food supply 
system. 
Now, 
small 
State-inspected 
proc-
essors, meat processors, did what they 
could to step up and close the gap, fill 
the gap, but their efforts were hindered 
by the fact that Federal laws don’t 
allow for State-inspected facilities to 
ship meat across State lines. 
I would observe that this pandemic is 
only accelerating the American desire 
to know where their food comes from 
and their desire to purchase directly 
from producers. So that is why, this 
week, along with Speaker Pro Tem 
HENRY CUELLAR, I introduced the DI-
RECT Act. 
This bill allows these State-inspected 
meat facilities to sell their meat across 
State lines through e-commerce. That 
is really going to unlock an incredible 
amount of potential as small producers 
and processors will have the option to 
put that product into the hands of con-
sumers. 
I think it is important to remember 
that many States like South Dakota 
have State-inspection standards that 
are at least equal to what the Federal 
Government already requires, so this 
isn’t a food safety issue. 
This bill would cut through the red 
tape. It would allow more flexibility. It 
would allow more opportunity for pro-
ducers, for processors, and for con-
sumers. 
Now, the DIRECT Act is a market- 
based approach allowing producers and 
retailers, under State inspection, to es-
tablish those connections with cus-
tomers in different States through e- 
commerce. That is going to empower 
consumers to buy—if they want a par-
ticular branded product, they are going 
to be able to get that product. They 
will be given more freedom to choose. 
At the same time, we as a country 
won’t have any reduction in our con-
fidence that our food supply system is 
safe. 
SENATE NEEDS TO PASS HEROES 
ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today because the coronavirus is 
winning. There are 2.5 million U.S. 
cases and more than 126,000 Americans 
dead. That is more than double the 
number of American lives lost during 
the Korean war, tens of thousands 
more than the two-decade Vietnam 
war, and 10,000 more than World War I. 
The United States has 4.25 percent of 
the world’s population but 25 percent of 
the COVID–19 deaths. Tens of millions 
of Americans have lost their jobs or 
faced pay cuts. And in the coming 
weeks, economic lifelines passed by 
Congress 
that 
have 
cushioned 
the 
blows are going to expire. 
It does not have to be this way. Right 
now, as I speak, the Senate is sitting 
on the HEROES Act, a bill that Major-
ity Leader MCCONNELL has refused to 
consider for more than 45 days. 
What could have been done in those 
45 days? 
Moody’s Analytics said: ‘‘If quickly 
passed into law, the HEROES Act 
would provide a substantial boost to 
the economy during the second half of 
this year, when the economy is most 
vulnerable to the pandemic and at 
most risk of sliding back into reces-
sion. The legislation would also return 
the economy to full employment much 
more quickly.’’ 
Moody’s also said: ‘‘How well the 
economy does in the next several years 
depends critically on what lawmakers 
decide to do in the next few weeks.’’ 
That was more than a week ago, yet 
the Senate still refuses to pass a bill 
that puts money in the pockets of 
workers with a second round of direct 
payments to families, a bill with new 
payroll protection measures to keep 60 
million workers connected with their 
jobs, a bill that extends weekly $600 
Federal 
unemployment 
benefits 
through next January so families can 
pay their bills. 
But HEROES isn’t just a bill to pro-
vide relief from the pandemic; it is a 
bill to end it. HEROES contains $75 bil-
lion for more COVID–19 testing and 
contact tracing and $500 million to help 
our workforce system place new con-
tact tracers, focusing specifically on 
Americans who are out of work and 
drawing from the communities they 
will work in with the diversity reflect-
ing those unique communities and the 
language competencies necessary to 
serve them. 
This last part is so important and a 
core piece of my Coronavirus Contain-
ment Corps Act, my bill with Senator 
WARREN that is included in the HE-
ROES Act in substantial part. 
Last week, Dr. Fauci said that U.S. 
contact tracing isn’t going well. Why? 
Well, Dr. Redfield, the CDC Director, 
says that we have 27,000 or 28,000 con-
tact tracers when we need, in his own 
estimation, 100,000, and when other ex-
perts believe we may need double that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2990 
July 1, 2020 
We have public health departments 
that are underfunded. We have commu-
nities that, after decades of discrimina-
tion, are understandably weary of 
trusting 
health 
authorities. 
The 
Coronavirus Containment Core Act ad-
dresses every one of those issues. We 
have solutions ready. No single one of 
the solutions is a cure-all, but, to-
gether, they can turn the tide of this 
pandemic. 
We as Members of this body are in a 
unique and privileged position to de-
velop solutions that channel the re-
sources we need to implement those so-
lutions on a nationwide scale. To fail 
to do this is to accept the status quo. 
Let’s make the HEROES Act law. 
There is not a minute to waste. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOSEPH J. MANCINO, SR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Joseph J. Mancino, Sr., of Ponte 
Vedra 
Beach, 
Florida, who, sadly, 
passed away in late June. 
Mr. Mancino was a true American pa-
triot who embodied the selfless values 
of the Greatest Generation. He joined 
the Navy at the age of 17 and bravely 
served aboard the USS Griffin and USS 
Coucal in the Pacific during World War 
II. He also witnessed the atomic bomb 
explosion dropped over the Bikini Atoll 
during Operation Crossroads, which 
was the first atomic test after the war. 
Joseph received numerous medals for 
his service, including the Philippine 
Liberation Medal and Good Conduct 
Medal. 
Those who knew him best say that 
the only thing stronger than his love 
for his country was his love for his 
family and friends. He is survived by 
his wife, Mary—his wife of 72 years— 
his four children, seven grandchildren, 
and six great-grandchildren. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida and the 
United States of America, I thank Mr. 
Mancino for his service to our Nation 
and offer our sincerest condolences to 
his family and friends. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TYLER LEHMAN 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in memory of Tyler Lehman, 
who, tragically, passed away from a 
rare form of leukemia during 2017. 
During his battle with cancer, Tyler 
became an inspiration to many in our 
Jacksonville, Florida, community. De-
spite numerous cycles of remission, re-
lapse, and chemotherapy, which took a 
really hard toll on his body, he never 
lost that positive spirit. 
Each year, no matter how difficult it 
was for him, Tyler would lead his team 
of walkers for the annual Light the 
Night 
Walk 
for 
the 
Leukemia 
& 
Lymphoma Society. His team con-
tinues to walk each year in his mem-
ory. 
He has also befriended people from 
all over the world, supporting them as 
they struggled with their own indi-
vidual ailments and conditions. 
He loved the outdoors, whether it 
was biking nearly 20 miles each day for 
charity or barbecuing at Cedar Point 
Park. It has now been over 3 years 
since his passing, and he is still missed 
dearly by his family and friends. Tyler 
was important to so many in northeast 
Florida, and I know that his memory 
will live on forever in those whom he 
touched.

RECOGNIZING JACKSONVILLE FIRE AND RESCUE 
DEPARTMENT AND U.S. COAST GUARD SECTOR 
JACKSONVILLE 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Jackson-
ville Fire and Rescue Department and 
United States Coast Guard Sector 
Jacksonville for their response to a 
vessel 
fire 
beginning 
June 
4 
at 
JAXPORT. 
For days, under the leadership of 
Fire Chief Keith Powers and Sector 
Jacksonville Captain Mark Vlaun, they 
battled this fire under difficult condi-
tions with bravery and skill, extin-
guishing the flames and saving the ship 
from complete destruction. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, nine of 
those brave firefighters sustained inju-
ries in the blaze, and five are still re-
covering. 
We are so thankful to have these out-
standing firefighters in northeast Flor-
ida who are the heroes of our commu-
nities, saving lives every single day. It 
is comforting to know we have tal-
ented, trained professionals ready to 
respond to a medical emergency, a 
house fire, or in this case, a ship fire, 
at a moment’s notice. 
Our thoughts continue to be with the 
injured firefighters and their families, 
and we wish them a full and speedy re-
covery. 
f 
PUBLIC EDUCATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, what an 
honor it is to be on this House floor 
with you here today in representation 
of the 700,000 constituents I serve from 
Michigan’s 11th District. We are here 
for the activity of this House floor. We 
are here for the grand deliberation of 
our democracy and for the discourse 
that makes our Nation’s laws. 
It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that this 
pandemic is continuing to pose a seri-
ous threat to our communities and to 
our Nation. As the global death toll 
has crossed 500,000 this week alone, the 
World Health Organization has warned 
that the worst is yet to come. The suf-
fering and loss of life that we have al-
ready 
endured 
in 
Michigan 
and 
throughout 
this 
Nation 
is 
unfathomable. 
We must recommit to saving lives by 
listening to the guidance of the public 
health experts who are telling us to 
wear a mask and to socially distance as 
much as possible. We must recommit 
to the science that stands before us. 
As a result of this pandemic, Mr. 
Speaker, we must look at the battle be-
fore us in terms of what our States are 
facing with budget shortfalls. You see, 
Mr. Speaker, this is what we do as ap-
propriators, as individuals who conduct 
oversight and who authorize the activ-
ity and the efforts of our Federal agen-
cies and for the Nation’s purse strings. 
Without additional Federal funding 
for Michigan’s public schools, a typical 
school district in Michigan is looking 
at a $750-per-pupil cut to our State’s 
budget shortfall. 
The White House recently signed an 
executive order saying, we are going to 
look for the skills in an individual. 
How do you obtain the skills if you are 
not in a fully funded school? When first 
robotics doesn’t exist, when the skills 
training doesn’t exist, and when the 
guidance counselors who are going to 
be there to shepherd our students 
through this trauma they endured can-
not do their jobs? 
When we are cutting, cutting, cut-
ting. And then we say: Guess what? 
The Federal taxpayer dollars that you 
pay and the State taxpayer dollars 
that you pay are not enough. 
Who pays again? 
Who pays again? 
It is the middle class. It is the indi-
vidual. 
Mr. Speaker, I am tired of it. I am 
tired of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 
corporations at the expense of our mid-
dle class. I am here to deliver for my 
constituents. I am here to give them a 
return on their investment that they 
make every year. They are looking at 
us. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, this is some-
thing that this House majority has al-
ready done in the HEROES Act. We 
have already taken these steps to ad-
dress these budget shortfalls. We are 
here today to vote on an infrastructure 
bill to rebuild America’s schools, to 
put people back to work, and to stand 
for the best this Nation has to offer. 
I did this work in the halls of govern-
ment on the other side of Pennsylvania 
Avenue during another time of crisis, 
during another time of choppy waters, 
and I am a believer in these institu-
tions, Mr. Speaker. I saw what happens 
when Democrats and Republicans come 
together for the best outcomes, when 
we rescued the auto industry and mil-
lions of auto worker jobs, saying, we 
will not let you fail, picking up from 
where the Bush administration left off 
and where the Obama administration 
finished it. 
We will not let you fail. That is what 
I say from this House floor today on 
behalf of the 700,000 constituents from 
Michigan’s 11th District I proudly rep-
resent.

HONORING FORMER MAYOR PAUL 
GAINES, SR. 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a Rhode Island legend, 
the late former mayor of Newport, 
Paul Gaines, Sr. 
At a moment in our Nation’s history, 
when we are again confronting the tor-
ment of generations of racial inequal-
ity, and collectively working to repair 
the soul of America, Paul Gaines will 
be remembered as a trailblazer in the 
fight for equal justice under the law. 
As New England’s and Rhode Island’s 
first Black mayor, Mayor Gaines was 
an inspiration, an educator, a soldier, a 
mentor, and a change-maker who suc-
ceeded in every endeavor by bridging 
divides and leading with humility and 
integrity. 
When he died last Thursday, at the 
age of 88, Mayor Gaines left behind an 
enormous legacy. 
As an activist, he spent a decade of 
his life working to build a memorial to 
the First Rhode Island Regiment, a 
Continental Army regiment that is 
best remembered today for recruiting 
Black soldiers to serve during the Rev-
olutionary War. 
In these recent years, he continued 
his work to ensuring equality of oppor-
tunity regardless of one’s race, who 
they are, or where they came from. 
Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest sym-
pathies to his wife of 61 years, Jo Eva, 
and to the entire Gaines family. 
f 
CELEBRATING ARTHUR ETZLER’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, born in 
Lavaca County, Texas, Arthur Etzler is 
a native of the 27th Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas. July 2, 2020, is his 100th 
birthday, but that is not the only thing 
remarkable about Arthur. 
On September 22, 1942, Mr. Etzler 
pledged his service to the Army’s 88th 
Division, 
149th 
Infantry 
Regiment, 
Company H, otherwise known as the 
Blue Devils, to fight in World War II. 
Arthur’s service took him across the 
world. He defended freedom in Mo-
rocco, North Africa, Rome. He com-
pleted his tour in Germany, where he 
shared a brief and joyful reunion with 
his brother, Hubert. 
Private Etzler’s service did not go 
unnoticed. His courageous fight in the 
Po River Valley earned him three 
Bronze Stars. General George C. Mar-
shall once stated that Mr. Etzler’s first 
division ‘‘fought like wildcats.’’ 
After his service, Arthur returned 
stateside to Hallettsville, Texas. There, 
he found the love of his life, Rosemary, 
his sweetheart of now nearly 73 years. 
Together, they built their home in 
Hallettsville and raised six children. 
Arthur’s service to others never 
ceased. His life is marked with decency 
and strength. Mr. and Mrs. Etzler re-
main active members of their church 
and community, where they are known 
for their dedication and kindhearted-
ness. 
Arthur has lived a life that reflects 
the spirit of this Nation, and for that, 
we thank him. 
Happy birthday, Arthur. God bless.

TIME TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House

Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
night after night, young people in 
Portland, joined by thousands of their 
neighbors, gathered to demand justice 
that Black lives matter. Yet, today, 
thousands are caught in the legacy of 
Richard 
Nixon’s 
cynical 
‘‘War 
on 
Drugs.’’ It targeted young, and espe-
cially Black people, for selective en-
forcement. Too many are in jail or 
prison for nonviolent, often trivial of-
fenses. 
Today, over two-thirds of Ameri-
cans—and 
the 
majority 
of 
Repub-
licans—think that cannabis should be 
legal. Let’s pass the MORE Act, with 
many of BARBARA LEE’s marijuana jus-
tice provisions already approved by the 
Committee on the Judiciary. Stop dis-
criminatory, 
selective 
enforcement. 
Let’s legalize it and stop enforcement 
all together. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to finally pro-
tect young Black Americans from the 
dangerous, 
discriminatory, 
selective 
enforcement on the War on Drugs. 
Time to finally legalize marijuana.

CELEBRATING 
LIFE, 
LIBERTY, 
PURSUIT 
OF 
HAPPINESS 
THIS 
JULY FOURTH 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, on July 3, 1776, John Adams 
expressed his belief that the signing of 
the Declaration of Independence should 
be commemorated ‘‘with pomp and pa-
rade, with shows, games, sports, guns, 
bells, bonfires, and illuminations from 
one end of this continent to the other, 
from this time forward forever more.’’ 
Well, I actually think we are going to 
check most of those boxes this July 3 
in South Dakota in the beautiful Black 
Hills, as President Trump is there to 
watch fireworks over the incredible 
Mount Rushmore. 
Now, I know there is a lot of political 
unrest in this country. On any given 
day, there is plenty of political unrest 
in this Chamber. But July Fourth 
should be a time for us to come to-
gether and celebrate what binds us to-
gether: life, liberty, the pursuit of hap-
piness.

July 1, 2020 
Committee on Oversight and Reform be 
discharged from further consideration 
of H. Res. 1036, and I, furthermore, ask 
for its immediate consideration by the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is advised that under guidelines 
consistently 
issued 
by 
successive 
Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of 
the House Rules and Manual, the Chair 
is constrained not to entertain the re-
quest unless it has been cleared by the 
bipartisan floor and committee leader-
ships. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I understand the Speaker’s 
ruling, but nevertheless, I wish the 
United States of America a very happy 
birthday.

INVESTING IN OUR NATION’S 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
BLUNT 
ROCHESTER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2, the Moving Forward Act. This infra-
structure bill invests in our roads, 
bridges, transit systems, schools, hous-
ing, clean water systems, and so much 
more. 
Importantly, it will create good-pay-
ing jobs, repair critical infrastructure, 
address the climate crisis, and create 
healthier and safer communities. I am 
proud that this bill includes key provi-
sions that I championed in Congress, 
including repairing our natural gas 
pipelines to prevent methane leaks, in-
vesting in our public buildings to make 
them 
more 
energy 
efficient, 
and 
incentivizing our Nation’s ports to re-
duce harmful emissions. These invest-
ments are a down payment on our Na-
tion’s future, and they will, indeed, 
help us move America forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the passage of 
H.R. 2. 
f 
RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE OF 
USMCA IN WASHINGTON 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to celebrate the United States-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement going into effect 
today and to recognize the important 
role this critical trade agreement play 
for my district in central Washington. 
In 2019, Washington State exports to 
Canada and Mexico totaled $11.1 bil-
lion. Now, due to the challenges of the 
pandemic on our economy, the USMCA 
is more vital than ever to provide freer 
markets, fairer trade, and more eco-
nomic opportunity in Washington. 
This modernized trade agreement 
will promote the potential for small 
businesses to aid in the growth and re-
covery of our State’s economy, and it 
will provide for expansion of equitable 
trade opportunities for many of central 
Washington’s farmers and ranchers. 
The implementation of the USMCA 
comes at a crucial time for the Amer-
ican economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have sup-
ported this trade agreement on behalf 
of people in central Washington, par-
ticularly knowing that my constitu-
ents will benefit at a time when they 
need it most. 
f 
SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENT FOR AMERICA 
(Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon, the House will vote to ap-
prove a $1.5 trillion transportation and 
infrastructure bill. 
This American nation-building pro-
gram will be the largest in American 
history. The Public Works Administra-
tion of 1930s spent nearly $700 billion in 
today’s dollars. This building program 
will more than double that investment, 
creating millions of jobs in the con-
struction trades, jobs in the supply and 
materials industry, and jobs in the en-
gineering and design industries as well. 
The program is good for economic 
growth at a time when our Nation is 
desperate for economic growth. For 
every dollar invested in infrastructure, 
that investment returns $1.80, or an 80 
percent return on investment, to the 
United States economy. 
The President and both political par-
ties have promised a robust infrastruc-
ture investment. Now is the time to 
reconcile that rhetoric with action. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of this 
bill. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING COVID–19 DEATH 
STATISTICS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
have heard several speeches this morn-
ing about the COVID epidemic. 
Like a lot of Americans, every day, I 
like to get up and see whether we are 
moving in the right direction or not. I 
was sad to see this morning—I checked 
the Worldometer’s website because a 
lot of my constituents tell me that is 
the one to check, and I was sad to see 
that, this morning, when they gave the 
number of deaths yesterday, on Tues-
day, they list 764 Americans who had 
passed away. 
However, the Worldometer website 
kind of goes up and down by the day. It 
is always very low on Sunday and Sat-
urday. It gets higher on Wednesday and 
Thursday. 
However, I did notice that the 764 
deaths yesterday, on Tuesday, was the 
lowest on a Tuesday since March 23. 
Mondays are always very low. We had 
366 deaths on Monday. That was also 
the lowest since March. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that we continue 
to have the progress as we work the 
number of people who die of this hor-
rible disease down every day, but I 
have a feeling that a lot of Americans 
are being misled. So I am just pointing 
out the way these statistics are going. 
f 
CONDEMNING ATTACKS UPON 
PRESS IN AMERICA 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of the free 
press in America. 
I can’t believe that I have to say this, 
but our free press is under attack— 
physical attack. As Americans have 
taken to the streets to demand change 
in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, 
we have seen our First Amendment 
trampled as hundreds of journalists 
have been arrested and assaulted by 
law enforcement officers. 
In the past few weeks, members of 
the press have been detained, gassed, 
shot at. One reporter lost an eye when 
she was targeted with rubber bullets, 
and the most infamous example was 
the attack upon peaceful protestors 
and journalists gathered outside the 
White House. 
Mr. Speaker, a free press is one of the 
most fundamental and cherished values 
in our country, predating our Constitu-
tion. It stems from 1735 when John 
Peter Zenger was arrested and charged 
with sedition for criticizing a corrupt 
British governor of New York. 
A free press is one of the most basic 
ways we hold our government account-
able. 
On the eve of our Nation’s birthday, 
I invite my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join me in sponsoring H. 
Res. 999, which condemns attacks upon 
the press and the detention of journal-
ists and reaffirms the value of a free 
press to our democracy.

USMCA GOES INTO EFFECT TODAY 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, a day 
that the farmers of Pennsylvania’s 11th 
Congressional District have been look-
ing forward to is finally here. Today 
marks the day the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada 
Agreement, 
or 
USMCA, 
goes into effect. 
Over a year ago, I stood here in the 
Chamber and said one thing I can tell 
you about the farmers of the 11th Dis-
trict is that they adapt and hold on to 
hope that better times are yet to come. 
With the USMCA now in effect, better 
times are indeed on the way. 
I am very proud to represent Penn-
sylvania’s 11th Congressional District. 
It is the number one district for agri-
cultural production in Pennsylvania. 
The USMCA is a win for farmers, 
with a number of provisions included 
that will give the farmers in my dis-
trict a level playing field and open new

markets as well. These reforms were 
critical for the district, which, by the 
way, is the number two producer of 
eggs in the Nation and also a top dairy 
producer. 
So, again, I would like to thank the 
President and his administration for 
their willingness to listen to the farm-
ers in my district and to ensure that 
USMCA is a win not only for farmers, 
but for manufacturers and employees 
in my district as well.

SUPPORTING THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to raise my voice in support of 
H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act. 
I want to congratulate Chairman 
DEFAZIO. He has been working on this 
for a long time. This is the infrastruc-
ture bill that we have been waiting for. 
He has followed what my father ad-
vised me to do as a young boy: If you 
are going to do something, do it right. 
And it is a wonderful bill. 
This is something that will repair 
our crumbling roads and bridges in this 
country, expand transit and commuter 
rail, repair and rebuild schools, make 
childcare 
facilities 
safer, 
deliver 
broadband to the entire country, re-
claim abandoned mines, save affordable 
housing units, provide access to safe 
drinking water and good sewer sys-
tems, and put more energy into the 
grid. This is something that this entire 
Nation needs. 
It is time for us to come together and 
fulfill this promise to the American 
people to rebuild and reinvest in our 
American infrastructure. It is the Mov-
ing Forward Act, H.R. 2. Let’s all vote 
‘‘yes’’ on that bill. 
f 
NURSING HOME NEGLIGENCE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, we continue to see appall-
ing nursing home negligence nation-
wide, including my home State of 
Pennsylvania. 
Last week, my fellow Pennsylvania 
Republican Members and I joined the 
Select 
Subcommittee 
on 
the 
Coronavirus Crisis to send a letter to 
State Attorney General Josh Shapiro 
demanding an explanation for Gov-
ernor Wolf’s deadly decision to readmit 
COVID–19-positive residents back into 
nursing homes. 
According to the most recent data, 
Pennsylvania has suffered 4,539 nursing 
home deaths related to COVID–19. That 
is more than 68 percent of the State’s 
total COVID–19 deaths and more than 3 
percent of the State’s entire nursing 
home population. 
The families who have lost loved ones 
as a result of this reckless policy de-
serve answers, they deserve an expla-
nation, and they deserve closure. 
Prior to my being elected to Con-
gress, I spent many years as a licensed 
nursing home administrator special-
izing in long-term care, and I have been 
horrified to see this avoidable crisis 
unfold. 
In closing, I would like to thank our 
frontline employees in nursing homes. 
They work so hard to protect the resi-
dents. And my sincerest condolences to 
the families who are grieving. 
f 
RUSSIAN BOUNTY ON U.S. TROOPS 
(Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, in re-
sponse to the attacks on September 11, 
my son joined the military, and I am 
now the proud father of a U.S. Air 
Force veteran. 
I know firsthand the anxiety felt by 
loved ones whose family members are 
called on to fight for our Nation over-
seas. 
As the father of a former soldier, I 
am disgusted by the allegation that 
Russia placed a bounty on our troops, 
and as an American citizen, I am out-
raged that the Commander in Chief of 
our military forces has seemingly 
abandoned his responsibilities. 
The President has an obligation to 
investigate these accusations and to 
protect the lives of American soldiers, 
but, once again, all we are hearing 
from this White House is denial and de-
flection. 
We deserve to know the truth. When 
was the President informed and what 
action has he taken to protect the lives 
of our troops? Americans should settle 
for nothing less.

REMEMBERING JACK THOMPSON 
(Mr. ADERHOLT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this morning to honor and to recognize 
Mr. Jack Thompson from Montgomery, 
Alabama. He passed away on Sunday, 
June 21, 2020, after a full life of 88 
years. 
He was born in Colbert County, which 
is now the Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict, in 1932 and remained a resident of 
the State of Alabama for his entire life. 
After graduating from Colbert Coun-
ty High School, Jack married his 
sweetheart, Ruth Hester, at the age of 
20, and Jack and Ruth were married for 
67 years and raised four wonderful chil-
dren. 
For 31 years, Jack worked for Auburn 
University Extension Service. After re-
tiring, he went on to own a farm in 
Athens, Alabama, and served as assist-
ant commissioner of agriculture along-
side my father-in-law, who was com-
missioner at the time, Albert McDon-
ald, from the State of Alabama. Then 
Jack, himself, thereafter was elected 
commissioner of agriculture and indus-
tries for 4 years for the State of Ala-
bama. 
Jack is now survived by his four chil-
dren, David Thompson, Keith Thomp-
son, 
Susan 
Woodham, 
and 
Janice 
Thompson, and his sister, Ann Thomas. 
He has 11 grandchildren and 7 great- 
grandchildren. 
Jack will be greatly missed by all his 
family and friends and all of us that 
knew him. Jack’s legacy will live well 
into the future. 
f 
SUPPORT IMPROVING THE 
NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Moving For-
ward Act. 
I represent a district where 85 per-
cent of the towns are 5,000 people or 
fewer, and 60 percent of the towns are 
1,000 people or fewer. 
Earlier this year, I reached out to 
every mayor and city administrator 
and county administrator and village 
president, 
151 
leaders, 
representing 
towns and counties in the 7,000 square 
miles in the congressional district that 
I serve. I listened to their needs, and 
the Moving Forward Act reflects many 
of their priorities. 
Now, the administration has said this 
package is biased against rural Amer-
ica, to which I say: What? 
The President has failed to bring for-
ward any plan that prioritizes rural 
America. This bill expands broadband. 
It strengthens water systems. It pro-
vides $250 million for our rural roads 
and our communities, rebuilding our 
rural schools, and prioritizing buying 
American in all that we build. 
Today, for the district I represent, 
and for all rural communities, I will be 
proud to cast my vote in favor of this 
important legislation.

WILDFIRE SEASON HAS BEGUN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, wildfire 
season has begun, especially in Cali-
fornia. In 2020 so far, 3,100 fires have 
started, twice as many as the same pe-
riod in 2019. 
Ongoing drought is part of the prob-
lem. We will be on the way to sur-
passing 2019 for the entire season as, 
indeed, we do have a head start. 
We shouldn’t leave our fire prepared-
ness plans completely to our fire-
fighters having to go out and do it 
after the fact. We need to get ahead of 
the curve. 
There are real solutions to getting 
fires under control in the West. A big 
part of it is forest management, espe-
cially on Federal lands. 
There are 100 million dead trees in 
California. When coupled with years of

drought, the risks of turning our for-
ests into tinder boxes is higher than 
ever. Responsible thinning and haz-
ardous trees removal is an essential 
portion of what we need to be doing. 
My bill, the CLEAR Zones Act, which 
is Clearing Lines, Electrical At-Risk 
Zones Act, would reduce the bureauc-
racy and the timelines to actually get 
the work done after permitting within 
60 days and increase the buffer zone 
along power lines so there is less dan-
ger and more ability to fight fire at a 
smaller level. 
Mismanaged forests lead to more 
fire. Without better practices, we will 
see more and more of the West go up in 
smoke. 
f 
REBUILD THE NATION’S 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act, legislation to re-
pair and rebuild our Nation’s crum-
bling infrastructure. 
I am pleased to see this bill make 
significant capital investments in our 
rural roads, schools, broadband expan-
sion programs, and much more. 
I also want to note that outdated in-
frastructure disproportionately affects 
rural and Tribal communities, which 
too often lack access to quality elec-
tricity, water, and sanitation systems. 
To that end, I was pleased to see two 
bills I have sponsored included in the 
package. 
First, the Tribal Power Act, which 
ensures that Tribal communities get 
access to affordable energy sources by 
increasing funding for the Department 
of Energy’s Indian energy education 
planning and management assistance 
program. 
Second is my bill for the planning, 
construction, and renovation of water, 
wastewater, and sanitation facilities 
across all of Indian Country. 
These much-needed updates to our 
infrastructure have been on Congress’ 
back burner for decades, putting the 
health, safety, and growth of our com-
munities at risk. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting 
in favor of this important bill and ask 
that you also do that.

REMEMBERING SERGEANT 
WOLFGANG K. WENINGER 
(Mr. JOYCE of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and service 
of U.S. Marine Sergeant Wolfgang K. 
Weninger. 
On June 16, just days before he was 
set to graduate from the U.S. Army 
Airborne School, Sergeant Weninger 
was tragically killed in a training acci-
dent. He was 28 years old. 
Sergeant Weninger, who went by 
Kyle or Wolf back home, was a grad-
uate of Kenston High School and a 
local sports legend in Geauga County. 
Known for his selflessness, Kyle 
joined the Marines in 2015 and imme-
diately excelled. In roughly 4 years, he 
earned the coveted Marine Special Op-
erator Insignia and rose to the rank of 
sergeant. 
Kyle’s instructors said that he pos-
sessed unsurmountable determination, 
a deep sense of integrity, and an uncon-
querable spirit. They called him a nat-
ural 
leader, 
someone 
who 
always 
looked out for his team. 
I had the opportunity to speak to my 
old friend, Kyle’s father, Ernie, this 
past week and express my profound 
condolences directly to him. As a par-
ent, I can only imagine how difficult 
this time is for him, Mrs. Henry, and 
their families. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in a mo-
ment of silence to honor Sergeant 
Wolfgang K. Weninger and to pray for 
his loved ones in the wake of their 
tragic loss. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
House will observe a moment of si-
lence.

CHILDCARE IS INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, the Moving Forward Act rec-
ognizes that childcare is infrastruc-
ture. 
Central to rebuilding our economy, 
stabilizing our workforce, and edu-
cating our children, childcare is a pub-
lic good, supporting more than $99 bil-
lion a year in economic activity. 
But we have not treated it as such. 
Ninety-six percent of childcare profes-
sionals are women, and 40 percent are 
women of color, and they are chron-
ically underpaid. Costs for families are 
high, creating barriers, especially from 
women, from entering and staying in 
the workforce. 
The pandemic has pushed this vital 
sector to its breaking point, and we 
cannot afford to let it fail. This bill 
creates a grant program to renovate 
and modify childcare facilities, helping 
them to reopen safely. It invests in 
providers and in our Nation’s children. 
Childcare is the foundation for build-
ing an inclusive economy, and now is 
the time to invest in our future. I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation.

RECOGNIZING BEASLEY, TEXAS, 
VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, Sunday is 
a weekly day of Christian Sabbath. I 
must confess that last Sunday my Sab-
bath was not very pious. I toyed with 
one of the seven deadly sins; the sin of 
gluttony. 
After I went to church, I drove down 
Interstate 69 to Beasley, Texas, and 
that is where I cracked. But it wasn’t 
my fault. It was purely the fault of 
Tim Sabrsula, who is the chief of the 
Beasley Volunteer Fire Department. 
At 11 a.m. they started selling huge 
chicken fried chicken plates at $10 a 
plate. The temptation of gluttony was 
overwhelming; I had to buy five plates. 
But Chief Sabrsula was not alone, 
Beasley Mayor Kenneth Reid joined 
this sinful attack. But I succumbed for 
a great cause, new equipment for the 
heroes at the Beasley Volunteer Fire 
Department. Chief Sabrsula asked me 
to close by saying, ‘‘Y’all come next 
year, you’ll be glad you did.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will ask Members to observe 
proper decorum in the Chamber.

OUR 
UNALIENABLE 
RIGHTS 
OF 
LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PUR-
SUIT OF HAPPINESS 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Satur-
day we will celebrate the Independence 
Day of our country. In our Chamber we 
have photographs of Lafayette and 
George Washington. In the preamble of 
the Declaration of Independence, it 
reads: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self- 
evident, that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their creator 
with certain unalienable rights, that 
among these are life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness.’’ 
Unfortunately, those words were not 
complete because African Americans 
were not considered men, and they 
were not given the unalienable rights 
of life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. We are still pursuing that. We 
did it with the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, and we are doing it in 
other ways with opportunities for Afri-
can Americans. 
And as we said in the founding of our 
country, that we are becoming a more 
perfect union, and we continue to do 
that today; to see to it that all men 
and women have certain inalienable 
rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. 
Hopefully, we will remember that on 
Saturday, and remember that the rea-
son why we cut ourselves off from King 
George is because we wanted to be a 
Nation of a rule of laws and not a Na-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2995 
July 1, 2020 
I brought this issue to center stage 2 
weeks ago during the hearing with Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, 
and we are starting to feel the effects 
back in Tennessee. 
This week I saw a flier from a busi-
ness in Tennessee pleading with its 
customers to use exact change due to 
the coin shortage. I, along with fellow 
Members, have sent a letter to Chair-
man Powell asking for additional guid-
ance and best practices for business, 
but we can all play a role, an impor-
tant part, to combat this shortage and 
help Americans who need to make 
every penny count. 
It is just my 2 cents, but I urge my 
fellow Americans to literally con-
tribute their 2 cents by putting their 
spare change back into circulation.

and procedures for use of advanced metering 
infrastructure, weather-normalized data, and 
open source standards, to measure such base-
line energy use and such reductions in home 
energy use; 
(4) that the State program include imple-
mentation of a quality assurance program— 
(A) to ensure that home energy efficiency 
retrofits are achieving the stated level of en-
ergy savings, that efficiency measures were 
installed correctly, and that work is per-
formed in accordance with procedures devel-
oped by the Secretary, including through 
quality-control inspections for a portion of 
home energy efficiency retrofits completed 
by each applicable contractor; and 
(B) under which a quality-control inspec-
tion of a home energy efficiency retrofit is 
performed by a quality assurance provider 
who—

quirements for an entity to be eligible to 
serve as a rebate aggregator to facilitate the 
delivery of rebates to homeowners or con-
tractors; 
(7) that the State program include proce-
dures for a homeowner to transfer the right 
to claim a rebate to the contractor per-
forming the applicable home energy effi-
ciency retrofit or to a rebate aggregator that 
works with the contractor; and 
(8) that the State program provide that a 
homeowner, contractor, or rebate aggregator 
may claim more than one rebate under the 
State program, and may claim a rebate 
under the State program after receiving a 
partial system rebate under section 33203A, 
provided that no 2 rebates may be provided 
with respect to a home using the same base-
line energy use of such home. 
(d) MODELED PERFORMANCE REBATES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out a State 
program under this section, a State may pro-
vide a homeowner, contractor, or rebate 
aggregator a rebate, to be known as a mod-
eled performance rebate, for an energy audit 
of a home and a home energy efficiency ret-
rofit that is projected, using modeling soft-
ware approved by the Secretary, to reduce 
home energy use by at least 20 percent.

(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in sec-
tion 33203C, and subject to subparagraph (B), 
the amount of a modeled performance rebate 
provided under a State program shall be 
equal to 50 percent of the cost of the applica-
ble energy audit of a home and home energy 
efficiency retrofit, including the cost of diag-
nostic procedures, labor, reporting, and mod-
eling. 
(B) LIMITATION.—Except as provided in sec-
tion 33203C, with respect to an energy audit 
and home energy efficiency retrofit that is 
projected to reduce home energy use by— 
(i) at least 20 percent, but less than 40 per-
cent, the maximum amount of a modeled 
performance rebate shall be $2,000; and 
(ii) at least 40 percent, the maximum 
amount of a modeled performance rebate 
shall be $4,000. 
(e) MEASURED PERFORMANCE REBATES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out a State 
program under this section, a State may pro-
vide a homeowner, contractor, or rebate 
aggregator a rebate, to be known as a meas-
ured performance rebate, for a home energy 
efficiency retrofit that reduces home energy 
use by at least 20 percent as measured using 
methods and procedures approved by the 
Secretary. 
(2) AMOUNT.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in sec-
tion 33203C, and subject to subparagraph (B), 
the amount of a measured performance re-
bate provided under a State program shall be 
equal to 50 percent of the cost, including the 
cost of diagnostic procedures, labor, report-
ing, and energy measurement, of the applica-
ble home energy efficiency retrofit. 
(B) LIMITATION.—Except as provided in sec-
tion 33203C, with respect to a home energy 
efficiency retrofit that is measured as reduc-
ing home energy use by— 
(i) at least 20 percent, but less than 40 per-
cent, the maximum amount of a measured 
performance rebate shall be $2,000; and 
(ii) at least 40 percent, the maximum 
amount of a measured performance rebate 
shall be $4,000. 
(f) COORDINATION OF REBATE AND EXISTING 
STATE-SPONSORED
OR
UTILITY-SPONSORED 
PROGRAMS.—A State that receives a grant 
under this section is encouraged to work 
with State agencies, energy utilities, non-
profits, and other entities— 
(1) to assist in marketing the availability 
of the rebates under the applicable State 
program; 
(2) to coordinate with utility or State man-
aged financing programs; 
(3) to assist in implementation of the ap-
plicable State program, including installa-
tion of home energy efficiency retrofits; and 
(4) to coordinate with existing quality as-
surance programs. 
(g) ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT.— 
(1) REVIEW
OF
APPROVED
MODELING
SOFT-
WARE.—The Secretary shall, on an annual 
basis, list and review all modeling software 
approved for use in determining and docu-
menting the reductions in home energy use 
for purposes of modeled performance rebates 
under subsection (d). In approving such mod-
eling software each year, the Secretary shall 
ensure that modeling software approved for a 
year will result in modeling of energy effi-
ciency gains for any type of home energy ef-
ficiency retrofit that is at least as substan-
tial as the modeling of energy efficiency 
gains for such type of home energy efficiency 
retrofit using the modeling software ap-
proved for the previous year. 
(2) OVERSIGHT.—If the Secretary deter-
mines that a State is not implementing a 
State program that was approved pursuant 
to subsection (b) and that meets the min-
imum criteria under subsection (c), the Sec-
retary may, after providing the State a pe-
riod of at least 90 days to meet such criteria, 
withhold grant funds under this section from 
the State.

States, and Indian Tribes as is necessary to 
carry out this part. 
(b) INFORMATION
COLLECTION.—The Sec-
retary shall establish, and make available to 
a homeowner, or the homeowner’s designated 
representative, seeking a rebate under this 
part, release forms authorizing access by the 
Secretary, or a designated third-party rep-
resentative to information in the utility 
bills of the homeowner with appropriate pri-
vacy protections in place. 
SEC. 33203F. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIA-
TIONS.

quirements, and provisions of this part, tak-
ing into account any factors that the Sec-
retary determines to be appropriate. 
PART 3—GENERAL PROVISIONS 
SEC. 33204. APPOINTMENT OF PERSONNEL. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of title 5, 
United States Code, regarding appointments 
in the competitive service and General 
Schedule classifications and pay rates, the 
Secretary may appoint such professional and 
administrative personnel as the Secretary 
considers necessary to carry out this sub-
chapter. 
SEC. 33204A. MAINTENANCE OF FUNDING. 
Each State receiving Federal funds pursu-
ant to this subchapter shall provide reason-
able assurances to the Secretary that it has 
established policies and procedures designed 
to ensure that Federal funds provided under 
this subchapter will be used to supplement, 
and not to supplant, State and local funds. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1028, the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
GRAVES) each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
these en bloc amendments which pro-
vides consideration of 27 amendments 
sponsored by Members on both sides of 
the aisle. 
The amendments contained in this en 
bloc amend various divisions of the 
bill, and affect highways, transit, rail, 
safety, water, natural resources, and 
energy policy in the base bill. Some of 
these amendments include: 
A designation of a route through 
Texas, 
Louisiana, 
Mississippi, 
Ala-
bama, and Georgia as a future Inter-
state 14, and designation of a route 
through Texas and New Mexico as fu-
ture Interstate 27; 
Directing a study on the effective-
ness of suicide barriers on physical 
structures other than bridges; 
Clarifying that replacement of func-
tionally obsolete warning devices are 
eligible under the railway grade cross-
ing program; 
Clarifying that transportation de-
mand data and modeling directed by 
the bill must include an analysis of the 
level of accuracy of existing modeling 
tools; 
Granting Puerto Rico the authority 
to begin issuing commercial drivers’ li-
censes, as all States have the authority 
to do; 
Allowing certain Surface Transpor-
tation Program funds to be used on 
local roads, including farm-to-market 
roads, in rural areas. There is a strong 
emphasis in this bill on rural areas; 
Making grant funds available to 
States who ban any non-navigational 
viewing of cellphones while driving; 
Requiring the Secretary of Transpor-
tation, within 2 years of enactment, to 
issue a motor vehicle safety standard 
for newly manufactured commercial 
motor vehicles to be equipped with a 
universal electronic vehicle identifier 
to identify the vehicle for the purposes 
of roadside inspections and enforce-
ment; 
Requiring States that collect data on 
traffic stops as part of the racial 
profiling grant program to include the 
data on the mode of transportation as-
sociated with the stop. 
These are just a few. I look forward 
to hearing further discussion on these 
amendments from the various spon-
sors. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for offering 
these amendments to improve the Mov-
ing Forward Act. I urge adoption of the 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
en bloc E. 
Of the 171 amendments in this bill, or 
in this bloc that we are considering, it 
contains 27 individual amendments 
carefully selected and grouped by the 
other side of the aisle with absolutely 
no input whatsoever from Republicans. 
Unfortunately, this is par for the 
course for the way the majority has 
managed its my-way-or-the-highway 
bill. 
These 27 amendments were picked so 
the majority could falsely claim that 
their bill includes bipartisan provi-
sions, when in reality this bill is still 
nothing more than a partisan wish list. 
Mr. Speaker, if a car is a lemon, put-
ting a nice cup holder in it isn’t going 
to make me buy it. 
Regardless, we should at least have 
adequate time or an adequate amount 
of time to consider and debate each of 
these amendments individually, be-
cause, frankly, there are a number of 
amendments in here that I do support. 
But this process has not been open. It 
should be open. But, instead, we have 
been dealt a poor hand from a stacked 
deck. 
It would be an understatement to say 
that I am disappointed by how the ma-
jority is rushing this bill, which spends 
$11⁄2 trillion of the taxpayers’ money 
through a sham legislative process. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would point out that 
all of these amendments are bipartisan 
and two of them are solely Republican. 
So, you know, the gentleman may have 
general objections to the bill for other 
reasons, as we discussed yesterday, the 
emphasis on climate change, and other 
provisions of the bill for safe drinking 
water, a substantial increase in waste-
water, and all that, but this en bloc 
should be virtually non-controversial. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Moving Forward Act, 
expertly led by Chairman DEFAZIO. 
This transformative $1.5 trillion in-
frastructure investment, the largest in 
our Nation’s history, would not only 
help rebuild America’s decaying infra-
structure, not only stimulate our post- 
coronavirus economy, not only create 
solid middle class jobs, hopefully many 
of them union jobs, but will also make 
the most significant investment in pro-
tecting our environment in a genera-
tion. 
Investments here will combat cli-
mate change, improve the resiliency of 
our shorelines, improve water quality 
for many American communities, and 
much, much more. 
This bill also includes a provision of 
mine, which incentivizes homeowners 
in my district, and throughout the Na-
tion, to upgrade their antiquated septic 
systems by reversing a wrong-headed 
IRS decision that requires homeowners 
to pay income taxes on septic system 
improvement grants that they receive 
from local governments, such as Suf-
folk County in my district. 
Admittedly, this is not a high-profile 
provision, but it will help homeowners 
financially and dramatically improve 
our environment by reducing the dev-
astating impacts of nitrogen pollution. 
Over the past 25 years, as a former 
mayor, county executive, and now a 
Member of this body, I have seen first-
hand how reducing nitrogen has helped 
revitalize the Long Island Sound, our 
national park. This can happen up and 
down the coast of America. 
Investments like these are critical 
pieces in a comprehensive approach we 
must take to preserve and protect our 
environment. I encourage my col-
leagues to support the bill.

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-

Puerto 
Rico 
(Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
I rise to speak on my amendments 12 
and 13 included in the en bloc No. 4. 
Amendment 12 incorporates my bi-
partisan bill, H.R. 6050, making Puerto 
Rico an eligible applicant for the Bu-
reau of Reclamation’s WaterSMART 
Grants as well as its Drought Resil-
iency Project Grants.

projects, as well as projects that im-
prove water management to increase 
resiliency to droughts. 
Currently, Puerto Rico is the only 
territory and noncontiguous jurisdic-
tion in the U.S. where these grants are 
not available. 
Reliable water service is essential, 
particularly as we confront COVID–19 
and we are asking people to wash their 
hands, and yet, in Puerto Rico we are 
announcing rationing measures im-
pacting over 140,000 customers. Unfor-
tunately, as much as 59 percent of the 
water produced by the Puerto Rico Aq-
ueduct and Sewer Authority is lost 
through a deficient distribution sys-
tem. 
This situation is further complicated 
by our vulnerability to droughts. In 
fact, per the U.S. Drought Monitor, 
77.48 percent of Puerto Rico is cur-
rently under abnormally dry condi-
tions. Approximately 59.84 percent of 
the island is experiencing drought, 
while 26.11 percent is facing a severe 
drought. The Governor of Puerto Rico, 
as I just told everybody here, has al-
ready announced water rationing meas-
ures impacting more than 140,000 cus-
tomers. 
Given this reality, Congress should 
ensure Puerto Rico, just as Alaska and 
Hawaii and the rest of the U.S. terri-
tories, is eligible for WaterSMART and 
Drought Resiliency Project Grants. 
My second amendment, amendment 
13, allows Puerto Rico to issue com-
mercial driver’s licenses, or CDLs, and 
makes the island eligible to receive 
Commercial Driver’s License Improve-
ment Grants. 
Requirements of CDL licensure pro-
mote increased skills, knowledge, and 
safety of those operating a commercial 
motor vehicle to a well-established 
standard. 
This 
amendment 
provides 
Puerto 
Rico a 5-year grace period to come into 
CDL compliance and provides imme-
diate eligibility for grants to expedite 
this process. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment in the en bloc package. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Or-
egon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of the en bloc 
amendments and the Moving Forward 
Act. 
In the last few months, more than 47 
million people in this country filed for 
unemployment. They need our support. 
The Moving Forward Act will help ad-
dress our Nation’s deteriorating infra-
structure and will help us transition to 
a clean energy economy while creating 
high-quality, 
good-paying 
jobs. 
My 
amendment will make meaningful in-
vestments in our workforce through 
registered apprenticeships and paid on- 
the-job training programs to fill those 
jobs. 
Last year, I worked with Congress-
man MITCHELL, Senator KAINE, and 
Senator PORTMAN
to introduce the 
Building 
U.S. 
Infrastructure 
By 
Leveraging Demands for Skills, or 
BUILDS, Act, to increase workforce di-
versity in the transportation, infra-
structure, and energy sectors. 
My amendment includes language 
from this bill to provide individuals 
who have historically faced barriers to 
employment, especially women and 
people of color, with the support, serv-
ices, and training they need to succeed 
and to find better-paying jobs with pre-
employment services, early employ-
ment support, and continuing employ-
ment services. 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO
and 
Chairman SCOTT for their support and 
leadership. 
I urge my colleagues to support not 
only the en bloc amendments but the 
underlying bill, as well. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
This amendment, which mirrors bi-
partisan bill H.R. 380 is straight-
forward. It requires the Federal deci-
sion makers at the Department of the 
Interior to consider the threat of 
invasive 
species 
when 
installing 
fishways. 
We all know that over time, the num-
ber of dams in this country have de-
creased. As the number of dams has de-
creased, a benefit is a lot of times fish 
are able to swim upstream, spawn 
more, and improve the overall health 
of our rivers. 
However, there are times where there 
are some fish that are not so good, and 
that is when we have invasive species. 
I have a big problem with that on the 
most significant river in the State of 
Wisconsin, the Wisconsin River. There 
is a dam there, and they were talking 
about putting up a fishway, which, on 
the face of it, sounds nice. 
The problem is, below the dam we 
have Asian carp; they are large fish, 
not native to Wisconsin. It would be 
devastating to the local fish. If they 
were ever able to work their way over 
the dam, they would not only pollute 
the Wisconsin River, but the lakes 
which feed into the Wisconsin River all 
over northern Wisconsin could also be 
polluted. And it is even possible that 
because there are areas that are kind 
of dicey, they could even work their 
way into the Great Lakes and all the 
way up the Saint Lawrence River. 
I appreciate the fact that we have 
considered this amendment. I hope it is 
adopted as part of the en bloc. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oregon for yield-
ing. 
I rise in strong support of this en 
bloc, which includes an important bi-
partisan natural infrastructure amend-
ment that adds H.R. 3742, the Recov-
ering America’s Wildlife Act to H.R. 2. 
When we talk about infrastructure, 
natural infrastructure, habitat restora-
tion and resilience projects must be 
part of the conversation. 
Such investments not only create 
jobs, up to 33 created per $1 million of 
investment, but they make commu-
nities safer. They grow our outdoor 
recreation economy. And they help re-
cover at-risk wildlife populations. 
This amendment will enable States, 
territories, and Tribes to complete 
proactive collaborative on-the-ground 
habitat restoration and the natural in-
frastructure projects that will recover 
more than 12,000 wildlife, fish, and 
plant species of the greatest conserva-
tion need. 
This amendment is modeled after 
legislation that has more than 180 bi-
partisan cosponsors, and it passed out 
of the Natural Resources Committee 
with a majority of both Republicans 
and Democrats. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tives Fortenberry and Raskin for co-
leading this amendment, as well as ev-
erybody who helped get us here today, 
including 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Leader 
HOYER, Whip CLYBURN, my dear friend, 
the chairman leading all of this, Chair-
man MCGOVERN, Chairman GRIJALVA, 
the 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee 
staff, and the entire RAWA coalition. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
en bloc and to support this bill. The 
country needs it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY). 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, as 
well as Mr. DEFAZIO for his leadership 
on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, the Recovering Amer-
ica’s Wildlife Act, I believe, is the sin-
gle most exciting policy development 
in the conservation space in decades. 
As an amendment to today’s bill, we 
are doing three things here: We are 
protecting ecosystems; we are enhanc-
ing community; and we are supporting 
recreation. 
I also add my thanks to Representa-
tive DEBBIE DINGELL, who has been a 
tremendous leader in this particular ef-
fort, as well as JAMIE RASKIN, the Con-
gressman from Maryland, for joining 
us. 
Mr. Speaker, most Americans don’t 
know that the Federal Government re-
quires that States do wildlife manage-
ment planning. This amendment funds 
that Federal mandate in a more cre-
ative fashion, by connecting resource 
extraction with prudent resource re-
covery, to help States improve their 
plans and create a continuity of habi-
tat for multiuse opportunities within 
communities. That is why we have 
such a diverse group of persons sup-
porting this bill: Hunters and anglers 
and birders and hikers and other wild-
life enthusiasts, as well as those who 
are involved in the burgeoning field of 
ecotourism. 
Mr. Speaker, here is another benefit. 
When something goes wrong, of course, 
we tend to act. And in this regard, we 
act through a very important law

called the Endangered Species Act. But 
this 
amendment 
puts 
preventative 
measures in place, moving upstream 
from the emergency room enactment 
of the Endangered Species Act and 
moving us from regulation and litiga-
tion to collaboration and conservation, 
which saves huge amounts of govern-
ment 
resources, 
societal 
resources, 
while it also enhances our environ-
mental security. 
And while there are some structural 
difficulties with the overall bill from 
my perspective, nonetheless, this pro-
vision is a winner. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO for yielding. I also 
thank his staff for working very hard 
to put this bill together that will add 
$1.5 billion to the $1 trillion that will 
be added for our highways and the in-
frastructure that we need. Thank you 
so much. 
I am pleased to offer this bipartisan 
amendment in order to designate the I– 
27 Ports-to-Plains Corridor as a future 
interstate that starts in Laredo, the 
largest inland port in the country. 
I thank JODEY
ARRINGTON, BRIAN 
BABIN, 
LIZZIE
FLETCHER, 
and 
BEN 
LUJA´ N for all the work that they have 
done to get to this point. 
This designation will make Texas 
and New Mexico eligible for increased 
Federal funding to complete the I–27 
highway expansion project, creating 
economic growth, jobs, and trade op-
portunities across those two states. 
The I–27 expansion would imme-
diately grow the Texas GDP by $17.2 
billion and create 178,000 construction 
jobs. It would also add 17,710 long-term 
employment opportunities in the new 
I–27 corridor. It would also make La-
redo the only port of entry that will 
have I–35, I–69, and I–27 as corridors, 
also. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in 
the House to pass this bipartisan 
amendment that will help improve 
trade in south Texas, Texas, and across 
New Mexico. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GARCI´A), a member of the com-
mittee. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of these en bloc 
amendments, which includes a bipar-
tisan amendment that I filed with Rep-
resentative GALLAGHER of Wisconsin. 
Our amendment combats old prac-
tices like the performance metric now 
known as ‘‘level of service’’ that pro-
vides faster, wider roads with more 
lanes, rather than a holistic analysis 
that takes into account increased traf-
fic, induced demand, or alternatives 
like bike and transit access. 
Our amendment improves the exist-
ing travel demand study included in 
H.R. 2 to examine ways we can prevent 
new projects from inadvertently in-
creasing traffic volume, time, or con-
gestion, all of which are bad for drivers 
and bad for the environment. 
We can and must make smarter in-
vestments by using current data and 
best practices, and that is what this bi-
partisan amendment is all about. 
It is endorsed by Transportation for 
America, the Natural Resources De-
fense Council, Environmental Law and 
Policy Center, and the League of Con-
servation Voters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
en bloc. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
b 1100 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act. 
At home we have seen firsthand the 
effects of our Nation’s aging and over-
burdened infrastructure in crumbling 
roads, inadequate public transit, and 
more frequent floods. 
Today’s package is not simply about 
rebuilding our roads, bridges, and rail, 
though it does all that. The Moving 
Forward Act is about making smart, 
transformative investments in our fu-
ture: investing in rebuilding school in-
frastructure to help them safely re-
open; expanding internet access to un-
derserved communities to close the 
digital divide; and creating millions of 
good-paying jobs in the process, lifting 
up entire communities. 
I am particularly proud this legisla-
tion has been designed with addressing 
the climate crisis as a top priority. 
Climate change is an existential 
threat. We see it in rising lake levels, 
a record level in Lake Michigan. We 
see it across the country in stronger 
storms and longer hurricane seasons, 
longer fire seasons, and disrupted grow-
ing seasons. 
We have to act now. We have to re-
duce emissions. We have to build resil-
iency. 
To that end, I am proud that this act 
includes two clean energy provisions I 
have previously introduced to promote 
electric vehicle charging stations and 
incentivize 
waste 
heat 
to 
power 
projects. 
This comprehensive package is trans-
formative legislation that will ensure 
our Nation’s infrastructure is built to 
ensure our success in the 21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to 
join us in support of this important 
legislation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the en bloc 
amendment. I also rise to thank Chair-
man DEFAZIO
for including the Hot 
Cars Act in the base bill. 
There are far too many ways that 
parents can lose their children that we 
can’t control. There are diseases that 
take the lives of our kids that we are 
just not equipped today to stop. But we 
have a duty to do everything that we 
can to ensure that parents don’t lose a 
child when we can prevent it. 
Fifty-three children died of heat-
stroke in cars last year. In most cases, 
parents—good 
parents—accidentally 
leave their children in cars. In other 
cases, kids crawl into an empty car and 
then somehow can’t get out again. 
Education alone cannot solve the 
problem. Even the most attentive par-
ents can become distracted and inad-
vertently leave a child in the car. 
I have talked to those parents. It is a 
crushing experience, as you can imag-
ine, one you never get over. 
A simple sensor, an alert system, 
that would notify parents that they 
have left a child in their car can save 
lives. 
It is really past time for us to enact 
this crucial legislation. The heat of the 
summer is really just beginning. Let’s 
get to it. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
DEFAZIO again for including this bill. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2 that Chairman 
DEFAZIO has helped craft and the en 
bloc amendment which is being dis-
cussed now. 
Transportation is Memphis. Memphis 
is blessed to be on the banks of the 
greatest river in our country, the Mis-
sissippi, and fortunate to have Fred 
Smith born there, which brought the 
greatest air cargo company in the 
world to Memphis, Federal Express. 
That is our number one employer. 
This bill will help airports, invest-
ments in airports, and create jobs, 
helping FedEx and helping Memphis. It 
will invest in harbors—we have the 
fifth largest inland harbor in the coun-
try—with dredging. That is important 
for the Port of Memphis. 
We have five Class 1 railroads, and 
there are investments there, and that 
produces jobs and moves goods and 
services. 
We have two interstate systems and 
roads that need improvement. This bill 
will put money into roads and bridges 
and create those jobs. 
It 
will 
further 
put 
money 
into 
broadband, which it is very important 
to reach into the inner cities to give an 
opportunity for young people, African 
Americans in particular, to get access 
to the internet and all the information 
that they need to have a good edu-
cation and a good livelihood later on. 
This bill includes several priorities 
that I have had, including a DUI law 
that is part of this en bloc amendment 
that will see to it that there is a study 
on why DUI convictions aren’t shared 
by States so that people who have mul-
tiple DUIs will be punished accordingly 
and save innocent potential victims 
from the carnage of a DUI accident.

It happened in Mississippi. A young 
Memphis girl was killed by a multiple 
offender, but nobody knew they were a 
multiple offender because their convic-
tions were not submitted to a central 
base. 
This also incorporates the Complete 
Streets Act that makes our planning 
more in keeping with the 21st century 
for pedestrians and bicyclers and oth-
ers who use our roads in alternative 
ways. 
This is an excellent bill. I am proud 
to support it. It creates jobs. It is good 
for Memphis. It is good for America. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO. There is no more important 
bill than this. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding to me. 
The coronavirus pandemic has taken 
a severe toll on our economy and has 
resulted in the permanent loss of 
countless jobs and highlighted the need 
for broadband access for workers and 
students. 
That is why the Moving Forward Act 
is so critical right now. It is a bold in-
frastructure package that will put 
America back to work, create new jobs, 
expand broadband access, and invest in 
schools and tomorrow’s clean energy 
infrastructure. 
I am proud to have included two im-
portant wins for Washington in this 
package. 
My bill to fund the Legacy Roads and 
Trails Program will prioritize culvert 
repairs and riparian habitat in Wash-
ington’s forests. 
My amendment to ensure transit 
agencies in King and Pierce Counties 
have flexibility and predictability will 
allow them to continue to serve riders 
during this public health crisis. 
Passing the Moving Forward Act now 
is how we shore up our infrastructure, 
set the stage for a clean energy future, 
and restore our economy and families’ 
financial security. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of this en bloc amendment, which 
includes my bill turned into an amend-
ment to authorize the construction of 
an access road to the Desert Sage 
Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, Cali-
fornia, in my district. 
The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter is the only Indian Health Service 
youth treatment center in the entire 
State of California. The only way to 
get to the facility, however, is by tra-
versing a dirt road that cracks in the 
heat and washes out in the rain. 
The Indian Health Service wasn’t 
able to secure the right-of-way to pave 
the access road, so my amendment 
would give the Indian Health Service 
the authority to improve and pave the 
access road to give Tribal youth safe 
and secure passage to this facility so 
they can receive treatment and indi-
vidual counseling in a culturally appro-
priate way that they need to reach 
their full potential. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for his support of my amendment to 
improve the infrastructure of the In-
dian Health Service facility in my dis-
trict and for his work on H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to offer an amendment to H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act, and thank my 
colleagues for their work on this legis-
lation. 
Our Nation’s transportation and in-
frastructure policies play a critical 
role in building healthy and safe com-
munities, but for far too long, they 
have perpetuated many of our most en-
trenched inequities. 
My amendment would require us to 
examine how our Nation’s transpor-
tation policies have impacted and tar-
geted our most vulnerable. It is critical 
that we understand how transportation 
policies are criminalizing Black and 
Brown communities. 
Specifically, we have seen violent en-
forcement of fare evasion policies and 
the discriminatory placement of speed 
cameras and other surveillance tech-
nology in our lowest income commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a moment of 
reckoning. There is a multiracial, 
multigenerational movement that, for 
the last month, has been affirming that 
Black lives matter, demanding an end 
to racist systems and policies that dis-
proportionately criminalize our Black 
and Brown neighbors. 
We have a mandate to center justice 
in all of our policymaking. Our trans-
portation policies are no exception. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers on my side, and I am 
prepared to close if the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) is ready to 
close. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I rise in opposition to this en bloc 
amendment, and I am, frankly, embar-
rassed by the process. 
I am willing to bet that everyone 
who sits on the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee is proud of its 
track record of working across the 
aisle to get things done. That is the 
proven track record for success for get-
ting bills actually signed into law, but 
that is not how our committee has op-
erated during the process on this par-
ticular piece of legislation. 
If you choose to operate and move 
legislation in this manner, you are 
going to get nothing accomplished; you 
are not going to get any bill signed 
into law. The only thing you are going 
to get out of this process is going to be 
a press release, and that is it. 
This is a sham process, and dusting 
this massive bill with a few amend-
ments 
that 
Republicans 
support 
doesn’t make it a bipartisan process or 
a bipartisan product. 
When the majority is ready to work 
across the aisle on responsible legisla-
tion, we will continue to stand at the 
ready to work with them. But I can’t 
vote for this en bloc package, and I 
cannot vote for the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In response to that, I will revisit a 
little bit of yesterday’s debate. 
President Trump ran on the issue of 
infrastructure. President Trump met 
with us a year ago in March. We start-
ed out saying we needed $1 trillion to 
$1.3 trillion for infrastructure. He went 
to $1.9 trillion, and then he ended up at 
$2 trillion. 
We discussed and agreed on what 
would be in an infrastructure bill: 
roads, 
bridges, 
highways, 
transit, 
wastewater, drinking water, rail, and 
broadband. All of those are part of this 
package. 
The total package is less than what 
the President requested a year ago 
March. He said $2 trillion. This is close 
to $1.5 trillion. Those components of 
the bill are about $1 trillion. So, that 
would be very close to what he wanted. 
b 1115 
The other components have become 
necessary because of COVID. 
I was talking to the chairman of Edu-
cation and Labor, and it has become 
clear that 50 percent of the schools in 
America do not have HVAC systems 
that can handle COVID—50 percent. A 
lot of these schools are pretty darn de-
crepit. So we are investing a bunch of 
money to safely educate our kids. 
Mr. Speaker, my hometown, Spring-
field, Oregon, a great place, people 
have a great public spirit. We have 
voted to bond ourselves several times 
for new schools. We have a fabulous 
new middle school, absolutely incred-
ible. It has a very big trades depart-
ment, because not all kids are going on 
the high school track, and we need 
more trades. We are going to need 
trades to implement our infrastructure 
bills. So we need to help. 
I remember I went to a post-World 
War II, brand-new elementary school. 
That school is still sitting there, and a 
lot of these schools are not suitable for 
children at this pandemic time. 
It also includes money for housing. 
We have a housing crisis in most of 
America. Certainly, on the coast; al-
though, of course, this administration 
cares nothing for the people who live 
on the coast. But even in some of the 
middle of the country, there is a hous-
ing crisis. This bill begins to deal with 
that.

It also begins to deal with our abso-
lutely decrepit public housing. That is 
Federal public housing, much of which 
is 50, 60 years old when the Federal 
Government did things like this, and it 
needs rehabilitation. 
So, yes, we have added a couple of 
elements to this bill that weren’t dis-
cussed with the President, but they be-
came necessary because of COVID. 
And also the Postal Service, which is 
more essential today than ever. Trump 
hates it because Jeff Bezos has Ama-
zon, and he thinks Amazon is getting 
subsidized by the Postal Service. Actu-
ally, no, the Postal Service makes a 
bunch of money by delivering Amazon 
packages, but it is difficult to pene-
trate. 
So he wants to destroy the Postal 
Service, which will actually dispropor-
tionately affect the people who voted 
for him in red States, and particularly 
rural areas. They are getting their pre-
scriptions and other things delivered 
by the USPS. 
Now, rain, shine, night, day, COVID 
or not, the Postal Service is doing it, 
doing it in 35-year-old delivery vehi-
cles. They are decrepit and incredibly 
expensive to maintain. This bill would 
help them buy a new fleet and would 
help them to get through this crisis. 
So, yes, there are some other things 
in this that were not in a traditional 
infrastructure bill. 
As far as the portion of the bill that 
comes from our committee, the Presi-
dent had seven infrastructure weeks, 
and we were promised numerous times 
that they were imminently going to 
propose a bill. The only bill they ever 
proposed would have shifted the entire 
burden to the States and said: Oh, and 
the private sector will take care of the 
rest of it. 
There wasn’t a Republican I am 
aware of who even supported that stu-
pid proposal. That is it. 
But now we are told: Oh, they are on 
the cusp again, $2 trillion coming soon. 
Well, we are trying to help them de-
liver here. 
We heard: Oh, Presidents don’t pro-
pose these things. They don’t do these 
things. 
We are here on the anniversary of 
JFK putting transit into transpor-
tation. We are here the day after the 
anniversary of a Republican President, 
Dwight David Eisenhower, signing the 
National Interstate and Defense High-
ways Act and funding it with a trust 
fund, which hasn’t been supplemented 
since 1993 because the Republicans 
have been in charge most of that time, 
and they won’t raise the user fee. 
Their alternative bill, by the way, 
doesn’t raise the user fee. So they are 
about $120 billion out of whack with a 
bill that only increases highways by 10 
percent, zeros out any increase in tran-
sit, and does nothing for rail. 
So, yes, this is a different product. 
But this amendment—and I misspoke 
earlier. Eight of the amendments in 
this package are fully Republican 
amendments; the others are bipartisan 
amendments. 
So you can raise concerns about the 
overall process and the overall bill, but 
this part is solid, and it should be ap-
proved by a large majority in the 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1028, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS) and the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES) each will control 
15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Moving Forward 
Act is long overdue, and it comes on 
the heels of a devastating pandemic 
that has killed more than 125,000 Amer-
icans and shut down much of our econ-
omy. 
The Moving Forward Act will repair 
our Nation’s dilapidated roads, bridges, 
and public transit systems. It will re-
build our drinking water infrastruc-
ture, upgrade our schools and hos-
pitals, and improve our affordable 
housing infrastructure. The Moving 
Forward Act will also create millions 
of jobs and help our economy to re-
cover. 
This en bloc amendment makes sev-
eral improvements to H.R. 2, including 
the addition of new language that 
would support the infrastructure of 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities, support long-term affordability 
of manufactured housing communities, 
remove lead in public housing, perma-
nently authorize the U.S. Interagency 
Council on Homelessness, and make 
postal offices more accessible for per-
sons with disabilities. 
These are positive efforts to more 
comprehensively 
address 
the 
infra-
structure needs of this country, and I 
commend each of the Members offering 
an amendment included in this en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this en bloc amendment. I want to put 
things in perspective. 
Mr. Speaker, I mentioned on the 
floor yesterday that there were ap-
proximately 390 amendments filed on 
this bill—390 amendments filed. There 
are 
approximately 
148 
Democrat 
amendments and there were 22 Repub-
lican amendments that were accepted 
and allowed to be voted on, but because 
of this distorted process, those were 
only being allowed seven votes. 
Mr. Speaker, en bloc B, there were 45 
Democrat amendments; en bloc C, 
there were 34 Democrat amendments; 
en bloc D, there were 28 Democrat 
amendments; and in this bloc F, there 
are 25 Democrat amendments—zero Re-
publican amendments in any of those 
blocs. 
The amendments in this bloc, there 
is another grab bag of the majority’s 
priorities, many of which take a very 
generous view of what actual infra-
structure is. 
This bill is supposed to be infrastruc-
ture legislation. The bloc includes ev-
erything 
from 
air-conditioning 
for 
postal vehicles to studying sinkholes, 
to unworkable vehicle mandates that 
have zero consideration for actual tax-
payer funds. It mandates the acquisi-
tion of certain types of vehicles with-
out looking at any type of economic 
analysis on the use of those taxpayer 
funds. 
It continues to ignore the need for 
reasonable bipartisan solutions to ad-
dress our biggest infrastructure needs, 
and rather than looking forward at so-
lutions, the amendment tries to elimi-
nate longstanding bipartisan agree-
ments that have addressed our infra-
structure needs and, instead, put these 
left-leaning visions in place. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. It 
didn’t have to be this way. We could 
have come together and written an in-
frastructure bill that would have easily 
cleared this Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you, 
going back to TEA–21 when our distin-
guished chairman was around, TEA–21, 
the highway bill, the Transportation 
Equity Act for the 21st Century, the 
vote coming out of this House was 337 
‘‘yes’’ votes—337—to 80 ‘‘no’’ votes. 
In SAFETEA-LU, our distinguished 
chairman emeritus, the dean of the 
House, led that effort. The vote out of 
the House was 417 to 9 ‘‘no’’ votes—417 
‘‘yes’’ to 9 ‘‘no’’ votes. 
MAP–21, 293 ‘‘aye’’ votes, 127 ‘‘no’’ 
votes, and I want to make note that 
our 
chairman, 
Chairman 
DEFAZIO, 
voted ‘‘yes.’’ He was in the minority 
but voted ‘‘yes.’’ 
And, of course, the FAST Act, once 
again, when the Republicans were in 
charge, a big four agreement, when Re-
publicans and Democrats had to come 
together. The vote was 372 ayes to 54 
nays. 
Right now, just to demonstrate this 
is doable, right now, Republicans and 
Democrats are working together in 
this very committee on the Water Re-
sources Development Act, including

both resilience and climate provisions 
in those negotiations. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a failure of lead-
ership, 
and 
it 
is 
incredibly 
dis-
appointing to watch this continue to 
happen when we have such urgent 
needs in this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman form Iowa 
(Mrs. AXNE), a distinguished member of 
the Financial Services Committee. 
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS
and Chairman 
DEFAZIO for their work. 
Manufactured housing can be a crit-
ical tool to providing affordable hous-
ing and a pathway to homeownership. 
But in Iowa, that option has been 
abused by outside investors who have 
bought up mobile home parks and 
promptly raised rents to Iowans by as 
much as 70 percent, and that is simply 
unconscionable. 
We must protect the residents in 
these communities and preserve these 
homes 
as 
affordable 
housing. 
My 
amendment does exactly that. It pro-
vides grants of up to $1 million for the 
good actors in this space who will man-
age the community for the benefit of 
the residents for the long term. 
We all know that America needs 
more affordable housing, and we need 
to do what we can to keep that now, 
not lose it to predatory landlords who 
are solely looking out for their bottom 
line. 
I urge the adoption of my amend-
ment. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS). 
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member GRAVES for yielding 
me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this en bloc amendment. 
There is a lot of bipartisan support 
for an infrastructure bill, so it is a 
shame that today we are considering a 
political messaging bill that is dead on 
arrival in the Senate. 
Part of the reason this legislation 
will fail is that it is a wish list for pro-
gressive priorities, many of which are 
outside the scope of what Americans 
consider to be addressing real and im-
mediate transportation needs. 
b 1130 
The bill was drafted without any bi-
partisan input. As the ranking member 
on the Housing, Community Develop-
ment and Insurance Subcommittee, I 
believe that housing and infrastructure 
are important enough to merit their 
own debates. 
While there are a few good ideas in 
this amendment, there are also a few 
bad ones. The underlying bill spends 
about $100 billion on housing programs. 
That is done without any debate in the 
House on the House floor other than 
this 15-minute debate. In fact, we 
haven’t done much debate in the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. Housing 
needs deserve their own debate. They 
deserve their own time. 
The majority would be wise to do 
hard work and bring truly bipartisan 
housing-specific bills to the floor. In-
stead they have chosen to package 
housing priorities with transportation 
priorities, which are both important, 
but it makes it less likely that either 
one of these will ultimately become 
law and be addressed. 
Very quickly I will speak to one 
amendment that, in particular, I think 
merits more discussion than it will re-
ceive today, and it would eliminate the 
Faircloth Amendment. That was an 
amendment that passed during the 
Clinton era that capped the number of 
housing projects. Bill Clinton signed 
that into law. I think it is really tell-
ing that we are going to undo it with-
out any real debate. That was passed in 
1998. That was a consensus change that 
moved us away from constructing new 
public housing units after decades of 
examples, 
including 
the 
infamous 
Cabrini-Green Homes in Chicago show-
ing the idea that concentrating low-in-
come Americans in inner cities did not 
reduce poverty, and it did increase 
crime. 
Even more so, it was another Demo-
crat President, Barack Obama, who 
created an innovative and highly suc-
cessful Rental Assistance Demonstra-
tion project. We had a hearing in the 
Financial Services Subcommittee on 
Housing, Community Development and 
Insurance earlier this year on housing, 
and a lot of people from the public 
housing sector talked about how suc-
cessful the Rental Assistance Dem-
onstration project was at getting pri-
vate capital to public housing units. It 
converts them into new, modern, pri-
vately owned, project-based section 8 
properties. In fact, thanks to RAD and 
other modernizations, notable housing 
authorities like San Francisco and At-
lanta no longer have any units of pub-
lic housing, and they have experienced 
remarkable turnarounds in terms of 
crime rates and reduced poverty levels. 
RAD is a truly bipartisan success 
story. It has raised $12.6 billion in pri-
vate funding to convert 100,000 units of 
public housing to private-market hous-
ing, and it rehabilitated troubled prop-
erties creating better outcomes for the 
residents. 
All of this has been achieved without 
Congress’ providing billions of dollars 
of funding. It has been private money 
that has funded the RAD program. 
Instead of looking to RAD and other 
modernizations for our housing infra-
structure, this bill instead focuses on 
going backwards to a time of failed 
housing policies at the very moment 
when, frankly, we need to be looking at 
21st century infrastructure. 
It just doesn’t make sense that the 
only way the majority can justify 
doing it would be to slip an idea like 
this, with 25 en bloc Democratic 
amendments, into a partisan 2,300-page 
bill. That just doesn’t make sense. We 
should have a separate debate about 
housing policy. I believe there are a lot 
of things we could come together on. 
Again, the RAD program was started 
under Secretary Donovan and Presi-
dent Obama. It was a Democratic pro-
gram that has been very, very success-
ful, and it has been lauded by Repub-
licans and Democrats alike. 
I don’t think we should be setting un-
related policy in a 2,300-page bill with 
an en bloc amendment like this. I wish 
that we had taken a different road. 
I, unfortunately, have to oppose this 
en bloc amendment. But I am hopeful 
that we can come together and have a 
focused debate about the future of Fed-
eral housing policy, and I believe that 
we can come together as Republicans 
and Democrats to find a solution. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am sur-
prised the gentleman who serves on the 
Financial Services Committee has not 
been a part of all of the housing de-
bates we have had, all of the informa-
tion on housing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A), a 
distinguished member of the Financial 
Services Committee. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I give a special thanks to Chair 
WATERS
for 
helping 
advance 
this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
en bloc which includes an amendment 
that 
I 
filed 
with 
Congresswoman 
PRESSLEY
of Massachusetts, amend-
ment 343, directing the department of 
Housing and Urban Development to 
find lead pipes in our Nation’s public 
and federally assisted housing and pro-
vide grants to remove them. 
Frankly, it is a scandal that we have 
to bring this legislation to the House 
floor in 2020, but we do. Chicago has 
more lead pipes than any other city in 
the U.S. More than 350,000 homes in my 
city have lead service lines. 
But the problem is nationwide. Ac-
cording to the National Housing Law 
Project, over 90,000 children nationwide 
in the Housing Choice Vouchers pro-
gram have lead poisoning, while an-
other 340,000 living in federally sub-
sidized housing are at risk. These are 
children. 
By now the dangers of lead poisoning 
are well-known. A 2015 study deter-
mined that children in Chicago with 
lead in their blood were more than 32 
percent likely to fail standardized tests 
by the third grade. 
We must remember, removing lead 
pipes is a racial justice issue. 
White flight to the suburbs left some 
of our oldest municipalities strapped 
for cash. Most jurisdictions require 
property owners to pay for the replace-
ment of lead pipes on their own prop-
erty, and the burden falls heavily on 
working class Black and Brown com-
munities like mine. 
After decades of disinvestment, our 
Nation’s public housing authorities 
simply do not have the resources to get 
rid of lead pipes fast enough. It is past 
time for Congress to act to keep fami-
lies in this country safe and healthy in

their homes. Housing is infrastructure, 
and I believe that this amendment is 
an important part of H.R. 2. 
I would like to thank Congress-
woman PRESSLEY for joining me in of-
fering this amendment, as well as sup-
porting organizations including the 
Natural Resources Defense Council and 
the National Housing Trust. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
en bloc. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR), who is a distin-
guished member on the Education and 
Labor Committee. 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of an amendment I authored to 
strengthen the broadband provisions of 
H.R. 2. 
We often discuss the dangers of the 
digital divide, and I am proud of the in-
vestment we are making today to help 
close that divide. But as with most 
issues of economic inequality, its ef-
fects run deeper for communities of 
color, 
immigrants, 
and 
low-income 
families. 
So it is very important for us to 
quantify 
the 
impact 
that 
Federal 
broadband investments have had on so-
cially disadvantaged communities, so 
that we can assure Federal resources 
are being invested fairly throughout 
the country or if these programs are 
inadvertently widening the racial and 
wealth connectivity gap. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
this important effort. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, 25 amend-
ments, and we are being given 30 min-
utes to debate 25 different amend-
ments. We just effectively approved 
$250 million—one-quarter of a billion 
dollars—in 2 minutes. 
These aren’t our funds. These are 
taxpayer funds. This bill had, I believe 
it was around 1,300, 1,400 pages of text 
just airdropped in the bill. It wasn’t 
marked up in committee. It was just 
airdropped in the bill, added to it, and 
now we are just going to appropriate 
trillions of dollars in taxpayer funds 
without adequate consideration. 
Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge re-
jection of this en bloc, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ), who is a distin-
guished member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the en bloc amendment and 
urge support for my two amendments 
that are included. 
My first amendment would take land 
in the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa 
Mountains into trust for the Agua 
Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians to 
fulfill an agreement between the Agua 
Caliente and the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. This bill would help consoli-
date the checkerboard pattern of land 
ownership and allow the Tribe to bet-
ter manage their ancestral lands which 
contain numerous significant cultural 
sites, trails, and other elements of 
their history. 
My second amendment, the Tribal 
Internet Advancement Act, would ex-
pand broadband access in Indian Coun-
try by adding Tribal lands as a priority 
for broadband expansion under the 
FCC’s Universal Service Fund. 
Last year, the FCC issued a report in 
response 
to 
my 
bill, 
the 
Tribal 
Broadband 
Deployment 
Act, 
which 
showed that Tribal nations lag far be-
hind the rest of the population in 
broadband access. This lack of access 
to broadband is a significant barrier to 
economic 
advancement, 
education, 
and, as now evident, telemedicine dur-
ing the pandemic, and well-being. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for 
my amendment and H.R. 2, the Moving 
Forward Act, in order to close the dig-
ital divide in Indian Country. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. TORRES), who is a distin-
guished member of the Appropriations 
Committee. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, while the Moving Forward 
Act is not perfect, I am glad the bill in-
cludes my amendment, the American 
Infrastructure Opportunity Bonds Act. 
This amendment would take advan-
tage of times when interest rates are 
below the rate of inflation, making 
borrowing essentially free. The amend-
ment would direct the Treasury to 
issue government bonds, in effect bor-
rowing at these low interest rates. The 
amendment then directs the proceeds 
to the Highway Trust Fund to support 
infrastructure 
investment, 
creating 
jobs. 
This amendment is a smart invest-
ment taking advantage of unique inter-
est rates to fund infrastructure in a re-
sponsible way. During severe reces-
sions, my amendment will provide cru-
cial support for necessary infrastruc-
ture projects helping both those who 
build and those who rely on roads and 
public transportation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption. 
Ms. WATERS. I reserve the right to 
close, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to 
highlight what just happened. 
We just went and effectively ap-
proved an amendment that would allow 
for $20 billion in bonds to be issued. We 
just effectively approved the transfer 
of 2,500 acres of taxpayer property 
without the consideration of the Nat-
ural Resources Committee, the com-
mittee of jurisdiction. 
This is like Monopoly money we are 
sitting here playing with, but the re-
ality is these are taxpayer funds. These 
aren’t our moneys. These are funds of 
the taxpayers. 
This bill has not been through the 
proper process to ensure that we are 
actually and legitimately addressing 
the importance and the integrity of 
taxpayer funds. 
I will say it again: dating back dec-
ades, Mr. Speaker, we have had bipar-
tisan legislation related to infrastruc-
ture—bipartisan. Dating back to the 
late 1990s, TEA–21, 337–80; SAFETEA- 
LU, 417–9; MAP–21, 293–127. I will say it 
again: 
our 
distinguished 
chairman 
voted for it. The FAST Act got 372 
‘‘aye’’ votes. 
These were all House versions, Mr. 
Speaker, not the conference report. 
What we are seeing right now, what we 
are doing—I believe, again, the number 
is 148 Democrat amendments compared 
to, I believe it is 22 Republican amend-
ments. 
This is not representation. This en-
tire process is a farce. We just approved 
perhaps billions of dollars—or we are 
about to approve billions of dollars—by 
giving it 30 minutes’ consideration. 
That is not what we were sent here to 
do. This process is fatally flawed. 
Three hundred ninety amendments 
distilled down to effectively allowing 
up to seven votes? 
This is a failure in leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this 
en bloc. I urge rejection of the under-
lying bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1145 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank 
Chairman DEFAZIO for all of his hard 
work on the Moving Forward Act, and 
I especially thank him for including 
my Housing is Infrastructure legisla-
tion in this important bill. 
My colleague from Ohio has ex-
pressed concerns that our committee 
has not sufficiently debated the hous-
ing provisions in this bill. But let me 
remind him that we held a hearing on 
H.R. 5187, which is the same text of the 
housing division in this bill, and that 
hearing was held in April 2019. We also 
had a markup on this legislation in 
February of this year. 
So, I don’t know where he was when 
all of this was taking place, but we cer-
tainly had sufficient hearings and 
markup on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Demo-
crats are committed to investing in 
and improving our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture, including our affordable housing 
infrastructure. 
Republicans continue to insist that 
these investments are irresponsible, 
but I contend that it would be irrespon-
sible not to make these investments. 
When we have children living in hous-
ing that exposes them to lead poi-
soning and homes in flood zones that 
are not built to code, we are setting 
ourselves up for much higher costs 
down the road. We must make the re-
sponsible choice and pass H.R. 2.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3022 
July 1, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, this is such a signifi-
cant piece of legislation, legislation 
that speaks to the repair of the infra-
structure of this country. 
Bridges are in disrepair and have 
been deemed to be dangerous. They 
may fall apart, and some have. We have 
water systems in this country—every-
body knows about Flint, but there are 
a lot of more Flints in this Nation, 
with old pipes, pipes with lead, children 
exposed to water that could cause them 
brain damage for the rest of their lives. 
We have roads and highways that are 
in great disrepair. 
The President of the United States 
wants to spend $2 trillion, and I am 
pleased about that. 
I don’t know what my colleague on 
the opposite side of the aisle is so upset 
about. He is talking about the Repub-
licans didn’t get enough amendments. 
Well, it is not our fault if they don’t 
know how to craft amendments that 
are appropriate and that should be in 
this bill. Because in our Committee on 
Rules, Democrats have been very fair 
in the way that they have dealt with 
this. 
I don’t know what he is so upset 
about that they didn’t get into this 
bill. No, this bill does not include in-
vestment in building a wall, if that is 
what they are interested in. We are not 
about building any walls to keep out 
immigrants from Mexico or anyplace 
else, if that is what they are interested 
in. 
This bill does not do that. This bill is 
about making sure that our citizens 
get the support from their government 
that they deserve, to make sure that 
their communities are safer, that our 
schools are safer, that our drinking 
water is safer. This is about making 
sure that we put the resources into this 
country that are so desperately needed 
and much of which have been neglected 
for far too long. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this bill 
and what it is going to do for all of our 
citizens in this country, north, south, 
east, and west. I am proud that the 
leadership of the Democratic Party in 
this government have taken this as a 
number one priority, and we are pre-
senting a total piece of legislation that 
addresses concerns that all of our 
Members have said they have had. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I am proud of the 
work that Mr. DEFAZIO has done, and I 
am proud of all the amendments that 
have been included in this bill. I am 
pleased that I have the opportunity 
today to stand here on these en bloc 
amendments and participate in one of 
the most important pieces of legisla-
tion this House could have ever pre-
sented. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous 
question is ordered on the amendments

AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MR. STAUBER OF 
MINNESOTA 
Page 1137, after line 10, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 22117. PERMITS FOR DREDGED OR FILL MA-
TERIAL. 
Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) is amended by 
adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(u) EXCEPTION
TO PERMITTING REQUIRE-
MENT.—Notwithstanding any other provision 
of this section, any person issued a permit by 
a State for the discharge of dredged or fill 
material which complies with the require-
ments of subparagraphs (A) through (H) of 
subsection (h)(1) shall not be required to ob-
tain a permit under this section.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1028, the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) 
and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
DEFAZIO) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, although I support this 
amendment, I want to, again, note my 
continued disappointment in this over-
all process. 
More than once, I faulted the major-
ity’s one-sided committee markup of 
H.R. 2, but at least we were given time 
to consider 165 Republican amend-
ments, although 112 were ultimately 
rejected and mostly through en bloc. 
But now the majority wants to further 
stifle consideration of minority amend-
ments by giving us a scant eight Re-
publican amendments out of nearly 400 
that were filed. We weren’t even given 
the courtesy to choose. 
In 2015, if everyone remembers, and 
for those who weren’t here, when the 
House 
considered 
the 
last 
surface 
transportation law, the FAST Act, 
there were more Democrat-led amend-
ments—remember, Republicans were in 
the majority. There were more Demo-
crat-led amendments that were agreed 
to than there were Republican-led 
amendments that were made in order 
for today’s debate. 
Of course, the FAST Act was a bill 
that was developed at that time by 
both the majority and the minority, 
which is a stark difference from the 
majority’s bill that we are discussing 
today. 
In fact, I remember the Big Four 
agreement. If the chairmen of both the 
subcommittee and the full committee 
and the ranking members of both the 
subcommittee and full committee, if 
one of us didn’t agree on a provision, 
then it wasn’t included. It was as sim-
ple as that. 
Today could have been a great day 
for all of us, and we could be approving 
a bill that all of us could be proud of. 
Instead, we are left with a bill and a 
process that shreds one of the only bi-
partisan issues left in Congress. It just 
shreds it to pieces. 
I can answer the gentlewoman who 
managed the last section of the bill, 
the financial services section. She said: 
I don’t understand why everybody is so 
disappointed in this. 
Mr. Speaker, because it is a failure. 
An absolute failure is what this bill is. 
And it is not going anywhere, abso-
lutely not going anywhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to oppose 
this partisan process, but I urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this en bloc, which provides for the 
consideration of eight amendments. 
The amendments contained in this en 
bloc amend various divisions of the 
bill. I will speak to a few that fall with-
in the jurisdiction of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. 
The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
BOST) would bar the use of eminent do-
main only for pedestrian and bicycle 
projects. Oh, by the way, he still sup-
ports eminent domain for pipeline 
projects, a very disruptive one pro-
posed in my district and here on the 
East Coast and maybe even where he 
lives. He isn’t dealing with that kind of 
eminent domain, not dealing with 
highway eminent domain, not dealing 
with transit eminent domain. He just 
doesn’t like alternate modes. 
Well, these would only take place 
under the Uniform Relocation Assist-
ance and Real Property Acquisition 
Act, which provides strong protection 
to landowners to ensure that any invol-
untary land acquisitions are fair, strik-
ing the right balance of protecting 
landowner rights, and construct nec-
essary infrastructure. 
Generally, this has been used on rail- 
to-trail projects or bike projects when 
there is one reluctant landowner who 
thinks that nasty people are going to 
be riding their bikes by the fringe of 
their property. 
In my largest city, Eugene, it took 
several years to get one landowner to 
finally allow a circular bike path to 
transit around the river. One land-
owner held it up for 3 years because of 
the concerns about the kind of people 
who would be riding bikes. Ultimately, 
a large fence was erected there with 
the barriers and all that to keep those 
people out. The path was done, but it 
shouldn’t have taken 3 years. That all 
could have been set earlier under the 
Uniform Relocation Act. 
Mr. Speaker, we are reemphasizing 
transportation alternatives. They were 
pretty much done away with during 
the FAST Act and MAP–21. That means 
cycling, 
pedestrians, 
scooters, 
and 
other modes now, which have proved 
very viable in the time of corona, when 
people are a little reluctant to get into 
taxicabs or even Ubers or whatever, if 
they don’t have their own single-occu-
pancy vehicle. 
We can realize a lot more safe com-
muting. We also have had a disturbing 
increase in pedestrian cycling deaths. 
This bill would help with that. 
There are also two amendments by 
the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. 
MCKINLEY) that preempt State author-
ity to protect waters within that State. 
Now, I understand. Yes, if you are 
from West Virginia, mountaintop min-
ing removal, dumping in the streams, 
all that. Great. We wouldn’t want to 
protect the waters. The water is doing 
just fine underneath all of that toxic 
mining waste. And then, well, we did 
have a little poisoning incident right 
near the State capital, as I remember, 
where people couldn’t use the water for 
quite a while. But, hey, States should 
not be able to protect their drinking 
water or recreational waters or any 
waters within that State. 
Then a wonderful one from Mr. 
STAUBER
that 
would 
deem—deem, 
meaning no process necessary—the per-
mits for dredge-and-fill activities, no 
oversight. That would, of course, over-
turn the precedents set by the Clean 
Water Act since 1987. But he is pro-
viding backup support to Trump, who 
is pretty much decimating the Clean 
Water Act with his dirty water rule. 
Then, Mr. LAMALFA
says that he 
wants to make it harder to get a rail-
road rehabilitation improvement fund 
grant. Well, he is upset about Califor-
nia’s high-speed rail. Unfortunately, he 
would make it virtually impossible for 
the Texas high-speed rail, which, by 
the way, is a private project and, I be-
lieve, supported by many Republicans 
in this House from Texas. He would 
make it impossible for them to get a 
RRIF loan if his amendment should 
pass. But, hey, he doesn’t like the Cali-
fornia high-speed rail, so tough luck to 
the people from Texas and elsewhere 
who want high-speed rail. 
Mr. Speaker, right now, a lot of the 
RRIF money remains unused, so we are 
trying to help expedite that in this bill. 
He would make it, again, nearly impos-
sible and harder. 
Then, Mr. CRAWFORD
would take 
away the 50 percent set-aside for large 
projects, over $100 million in the Con-
solidated Rail Infrastructure and Safe-
ty Improvement grant program. 
b 1200 
And outside my jurisdiction, Mr. 
HICE would strike the $25 billion to the 
United States Postal Service. 
I mentioned this earlier. Trump 
hates the Postal Service because he 
thinks that they are subsidizing Ama-
zon. Actually, Amazon is subsidizing 
the post office, but, hey, we don’t deal 
with facts downtown here very much 
anymore—or he doesn’t.

And it would also strike the money 
that they could use to buy a new fleet 
of vehicles. They should keep driving 
around in those crappy 35-year-old ve-
hicles which require massive amounts 
of maintenance and are, of course, pol-
luting. 
So I would also oppose that amend-
ment, even though it is not within my 
jurisdiction. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to how much time 
is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 121⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 91⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the postal provi-
sions in H.R. 2 and have offered an 
amendment to strike them from the 
bill. 
As ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Government Operations 
of the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, I was very much disappointed 
that we were not consulted on these 
provisions. 
My colleagues from the Oversight 
and Reform Committee and I have been 
closely following the financial health 
of the Postal Service, and we receive, 
in fact, weekly updates on mail vol-
ume, revenue, and cash on hand. The 
numbers are very clear, what we have 
received. The $25 billion postal bailout 
provided in H.R. 2 is just simply pre-
mature. We don’t need to go there at 
this point. 
A few weeks ago, I asked the Post-
master General to revise the initial es-
timates for the direct impact from the 
pandemic, which included this $25 bil-
lion for modernization. The reality is 
that, over the last several months, the 
revenue trends no longer support the 
Postal 
Service’s 
multibillion-dollar 
bailout request. This is because there 
are much better numbers and perform-
ance that has been driven by package 
volume. 
Let me give you some examples. 
During the first 11 weeks of the pan-
demic, the Postal Service earned $330 
million more in revenue than this same 
time last year. The Postal Service also 
improved its amount of cash on hand 
by at least $600 million. And as of June 
4, they had $13.2 billion in cash. 
In addition, while negotiations with 
the Treasury Department are still on-
going, the Postal Service has yet to 
even tap into the $10 billion in lending 
that was authorized by Congress in the 
CARES Act. 
A long-term plan to turn the Postal 
Service around is also being developed. 
My colleagues from the Oversight and 
Reform Committee and I have called 
for a 10-year business plan to improve 
the Postal Service’s business model. 
And given the start of the new Post-
master General’s term, we are hopeful 
that an updated plan that outlines spe-
cific reforms to put the Postal Service 
on firm financial footing is going to 
happen. 
But absent revised estimates and a 
business plan, it is unclear what the 
true needs of the Postal Service are. I 
will just say that the USPS was de-
signed to be self-sufficient, a self-suffi-
cient entity. The only way of dealing 
with that issue is by long-term legisla-
tive reform, not a bailout. That is the 
only way to do it. 
So we cannot continue throwing tax-
payer money away and particularly 
adding green new deals. I ask my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), the chair of the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform with jurisdic-
tion over the post office. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for his ex-
traordinary leadership on H.R. 2. 
I thank my colleague on the other 
side of the aisle, but I am urging a 
‘‘no’’ vote on his amendment. We are in 
the midst of a national emergency 
caused by the coronavirus, and it is 
having a dire effect on the Postal Serv-
ice. 
Despite 
better-than-expected 
reve-
nues in recent months, the Postal 
Service is still at risk of running out of 
money. It could be forced to cease oper-
ations if it does not receive financial 
assistance from the Federal Govern-
ment soon. This amendment would 
eliminate the critical funding that the 
post office needs. 
Throughout the pandemic, the Postal 
Service has continued to deliver life-
saving medications and vital supplies, 
especially to rural America. If the 
Postal Service ceases to exist, rural 
Americans will suffer the most, be-
cause it is the only delivery company 
that serves them. 
If any issue should be bipartisan, it is 
this one, because the post office affects 
every American and is critical to many 
of us. The Postal Service helps bind us 
together and delivers to every address 
in the Nation, no matter how remote. 
But the dedicated staff that braves 
the coronavirus pandemic every day 
cannot continue to do their job with-
out reliable transportation or funding. 
We must fulfill our constitutional duty 
and act now to save the Postal Service. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to oppose this amendment. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I have expressed my frustra-
tion about the fact that so few Repub-
lican amendments have been allowed 
to even be debated, yet this is the one 
en bloc amendment. This is block G, 
and there are eight Republican amend-
ments—eight—eight 
Republican 
amendments where we actually get to 
debate. And, of course, they are all 
wrapped in. Our amendment is No. 349. 
And, as I have mentioned before, near-
ly 380 or 390 amendments on this bill. 
Our amendment amends page 1968 
that I am sure everyone here has read, 
and what this does is it very simply— 
it very simply says that, in order for 
this brand-new urban park grant pro-
gram that has not been through the 
committee of jurisdiction, the Natural 
Resources Committee, if you are going 
to take money from one area and give 
it to this urbanized park grant pro-
gram, you at least need to make sure 
that the area where the revenues are 
coming from, which happens to be the 
area that I represent, that it is sustain-
able, that it is ecologically sustainable 
and the community is sustainable and 
that it would be a better investment 
for taxpayers to invest in the urban 
parks than it would be to ensure the 
ecological and the community resil-
ience or sustainability of these regions. 
That is it, a very simple amendment. 
I would love to have anybody come 
explain to me why they are going to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ because we are going to see 
this amendment voted down in just a 
few minutes. I would love for any-
body—and I would be happy to yield 
time, Madam Speaker. I would be 
happy to have anybody explain to me 
why they are opposed to this amend-
ment and what they are going to ex-
plain to people next time we have a 
hurricane and these communities are 
decimated. That is what I would love 
to hear. 
So, Madam Speaker, I yield my re-
maining time to my friends on the 
other side of the aisle to explain to me 
the opposition to this amendment. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Moving Forward Act 
as a critical investment in our Nation’s 
infrastructure. 
No matter where you stand politi-
cally, the state of our crumbling infra-
structure is something that all people, 
and certainly all Michiganders, agree 
on. 
The disastrous breaching of two 
major dams in my State last month is 
all you need to know. It is a cautionary 
tale for everyone. 
We are in need of generational in-
vestment in our infrastructure, and 
this bill includes many of the priorities 
I have fought for for our district, in-
cluding major money for high-speed 
broadband for all Americans, signifi-
cant funds for upgrades to our schools, 
and $40 billion for clean water invest-
ment projects, including PFAS treat-
ment. 
I am also pleased that the House 
adopted two of my amendments which 
protect Michigan’s most precious gifts, 
which is our waters and our water. 
One of my amendments is directly re-
lated to an issue called Line 5, a pipe-
line in our beautiful Great Lakes. It

will require the Federal agency respon-
sible for pipeline safety to share infor-
mation related to pipeline leaks, dam-
age, or disruption with relevant State 
and local governments. 
This is enormously relevant, given 
the recent disruption of Enbridge’s 
Line 5 pipeline under the Straits of 
Mackinac. The people of Michigan de-
serve to be sure of the safety of the 
pipeline. My amendment would make 
sure they have the relevant informa-
tion. 
Investing in our country’s infrastruc-
ture can and should be a bipartisan 
issue. I urge my colleagues to support 
on both sides of the aisle. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), the 
ranking member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I first 
want to thank the ranking member for 
his insistence that both parties work 
together to develop and fund infra-
structure priorities in America. This is 
the way it ought to work. This issue 
has never been partisan in the past. 
Mr. GRAVES has made the point, we 
will go to the table and work together. 
He is exactly right, and I support his 
efforts. 
I rise today to support Representa-
tive LAMALFA’s amendment to strike 
certain credit risk premium provisions 
in the underlying bill. The amendment 
protects Federal taxpayers all across 
America, makes sure they are not 
stuck holding the bag when a specific 
railroad defaults on its loans. 
The author of the original provision 
readily admits that this is an earmark 
for Texas Central Railroad in Texas. 
This is a private company that had 
claimed for years that they would fund 
this privately and it would be a State 
railroad, but they have reneged on 
that. They are now considering one of 
these loans to build a high-speed rail 
between Houston and Dallas. 
But Texas Central’s train is so risky 
and their financial situation so poor, 
they say they can’t even pay the risk 
premium upfront. And for this reason, 
they request that legislators change 
the Federal law in order to help the 
company qualify for a loan they would 
never receive under standard rules. 
This is a huge red flag if I have ever 
seen one. That is why I feel it is impor-
tant for legislators of both parties to 
support 
Representative 
LAMALFA’s 
amendment, to ensure that we don’t 
lose important taxpayer protections 
for these RRIF loans and allow for a 
prolonged CRP payment schedule. 
Here is the situation: Texas Central 
Railroad is privately funded and a 
State railroad, and it has always prom-
ised to Texas that this ‘‘project does 
not need, does not want, and will not 
ask for government grants for con-
struction or public money to subsidize 
operations.’’ 
Yet it is now clear that promise, 
which was used to gain support from 
citizens in communities across Texas, 
was misleading. In April, Texas Central 
announced they would renege on their 
original promise; they would now seek 
Federal stimulus money. 
And there is a reason they are doing 
that. The project’s costs have tripled 
from its original estimates of $30 bil-
lion. These ballooning projections are 
especially concerning, considering the 
project also faces other significant hur-
dles: 
Lack of financial feasibility; 
They have no power for eminent do-
main, thank goodness, although they 
are coming to Washington for power to 
seize people’s lands without their con-
sent; 
There are potential safety and fund-
ing issues; and 
Near uniform opposition from local 
and State officials along the rural 
route of this railroad. 
Texas Central is now asking House 
Democrats in the House to include a 
change in the Green New Deal legisla-
tion to make it easier to renege on 
these loans. We should not condone 
this. We are in a COVID crisis. Those 
dollars should be used for healthcare, 
not a boondoggle. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS). 
b 1215 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2, the Moving 
Forward Act. 
Our Nation’s public schools are in 
desperate need of repair, school facili-
ties across the country. I come from 
the city of Philadelphia, where our av-
erage public school buildings are more 
than 70 years old. 
I am proud to say that H.R. 158, the 
Rehabilitation of Historical Schools 
Act, which I am the sponsor of, is in 
this. H.R. 158 allows the historic tax 
credit to be used for rehabilitation of 
public school buildings. 
President Trump used the historical 
tax credit to transform an old public 
building, a post office, into a hotel. I 
believe that should be made available 
to fix our schools. Our children all de-
serve an equal shot at the future, re-
gardless of their ZIP Code. 
I stand proudly supporting H.R. 2, be-
cause I commend the leadership of my 
chairman here, who is demonstrating 
that we need to work this all together. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, can I inquire as to the time 
left on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WILD). The gentleman from Missouri 
has 41⁄2 minutes remaining. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 51⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I don’t have any other speak-
ers. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would just take 
this time to thank a few folks for this 
epic legislation, the transformative 
21st century transportation bill and, of 
course, for things from other commit-
tees that we have explained during the 
debate: Helena Zyblikewycz, my chief 
counsel on highways and transit, in-
credible yeoman’s work; Auke Mahar- 
Piersma, who took over rail; Garrett 
Gee; 
Jackie 
Schmitz; 
Brittany 
Lundberg, from my hometown; Chris 
Bell; Andrea Wohleber; Katherine Am-
brose; Alice Koethe; Kathy Dedrick; 
Mohsin Syed, our committee counsel; 
Jill Harrelson; Maddy Pike; Edward 
McGlone; 
Michael 
Hudspith; 
Jamie 
Harrell; and many more on other sub-
committees. 
I am just going to return to Kathy 
Dedrick for a moment. I do this some-
times; it always embarrasses her. We 
used to have a program here called the 
page program. I thought it was a great 
thing. A lot of pages went on, a num-
ber, to becomes Members of Congress 
or to come back and work in govern-
ment service. 
Kathy was my first congressional 
page, obviously, a few years ago. She is 
from Lebanon, Oregon. She came back 
later and worked for me when we did 
the SAFETEA-LU bill, a few years ago, 
as my designated person when I chaired 
the Highways Subcommittee—I mean, 
when I was ranking member on the 
Highways Subcommittee. She worked 
for Al Gore. She worked downtown. At 
a very auspicious and appropriate time, 
she came back to be my chief of staff 
on the committee and has just done ab-
solutely incredible work. 
Hopefully, I won’t have to be dis-
turbing her at all hours of the day and 
night and on weekends too much in the 
near future, and the same to many of 
my other staff who I have been both-
ering a lot as we worked through this 
process and other legislation in these 
very difficult times. 
Madam Speaker, I thank everyone 
who helped, and I thank those from 
other committees who contributed so 
much to the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Repub-
lican side. Paul Sass, Jack Ruddy—I 
am sure that Sam is going to do this, 
but I am going to do it anyway—Corey 
Cooke, Michael Falencki, a dozen com-
mittees. I said all the other commit-
tees. 
Office of Legislative Counsel, they 
have been troopers in putting all this 
together: Wade Ballou, Karen Ander-
son, Robert Casturo, and Kakuti Lin. 
The Congressional Research Service, 
Christopher Davis sat in on our epic 24- 
hour markup and provided invaluable 
advice when we threatened to fall into 
the parliamentary black hole a couple 
of times. He kept us out of it. 
And then the floor staff and, of 
course, the Office of the Parliamen-
tarian for their work as we determined 
jurisdictions and appropriateness of 
amendments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3027 
July 1, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I would like to lend 
my support for the gentleman’s thank- 
yous for the staff. We all know that 
staff works very, very hard on these 
pieces of legislation, and they put in a 
tremendous amount of time and effort, 
regardless of which side that they hap-
pen to be on. 
Madam Speaker, I want to continue 
to note how much of a missed oppor-
tunity that this is and this was. I sup-
port this amendment, but unfortu-
nately, it doesn’t fix the overall bill for 
it to make really too much of a dif-
ference. 
The sad thing is, is we know we could 
have come together and written an in-
frastructure bill that would easily gain 
bipartisan support, which it needs to 
become law. 
In 2 weeks, the T&I Committee plans 
to mark up the bipartisan Water Re-
sources Act, and I hope and I expect 
that it will pass. It is bipartisan at this 
point because it is a bill that both sides 
continue to develop together. We have 
worked together on it. That bipartisan 
process stands in stark contrast to the 
process that has been used today. 
The water resources bill absolutely 
has a chance of becoming law, whereas 
this $1.5 trillion wish list won’t go any-
where after today. 
I congratulate my Republican col-
leagues for their work on these par-
ticular amendments, and I would urge 
Members to support this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
none of what we do here would happen with-
out countless hours of staff work. I especially 
want to thank the following members of my 
own staff, all of whom have worked tirelessly 
on this bill: 
Paul Sass, Jack Ruddy, Corey Cooke, Tara 
Hupman, Justin Harclerode, Abigail Camp, 
Nick 
Christensen, 
Jamie 
Hopkins, 
Tyler 
Micheletti, Shawn Bloch, Michael Falencki. 
Cheryle Tucker, Trey McKenzie, Victor 
Sarmiento, Drew Feeley, Melissa Beaumont, 
Johanna Hardy, Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, 
Holly Woodruff Lyons, T. Hunter Presti, John 
Rayfield. 
I also want to thank the Democratic Com-
mittee staff for their work on this bill. 
Finally, I want to thank the Office of Legisla-
tive Counsel, especially Karen Anderson and 
Robert Casturo, for their long hours and hard 
work in drafting the bill before us, as well as 
the majority of amendments offered both at 
our markup and at Rules Committee. Their 
professionalism and skill are always appre-
ciated, and we owe them a tremendous debt 
of gratitude. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous

ant to section 3 of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. FOXX OF 
NORTH CAROLINA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part H of House Report 116– 
438. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division H, add the following 
new section: 
SEC. lll. PREVAILING RATE OF WAGE RE-
QUIREMENTS. 
(a) REPEALS.—The following provisions are 
repealed: 
(1) Section 113 of title 23, United States 
Code (and the item relating to such section 
in the analysis for chapter 1 of such title). 
(2) Section 5333(a) of title 49, United States 
Code. 
(b) APPLICABILITY.— 
(1) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Subject to paragraph 
(2), the amendments made by this section 
shall take effect on the 31st day following 
the date of enactment of this Act. 
(2) EXISTING CONTRACTS.—The amendments 
made by this section shall not affect any 
contract in existence on the date of enact-
ment of this Act or made pursuant to an in-
vitation for bids outstanding on such date of 
enactment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1028, the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX) and a Member opposed each will 
control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my amendment to H.R. 2. This 
amendment will modernize our infra-
structure spending to yield more in-
vestments in infrastructure projects, 
more jobs for frontline workers, and 
equitable spending for communities 
across our Nation. 
I am always hesitant about measures 
that are brought before this Chamber 
that are partisan, which is what H.R. 2 
is. I am disappointed that Democrats 
decided to turn the infrastructure bill 
into a partisan exercise by spending 
over a trillion dollars, while failing to 
address this longstanding problem and 
save taxpayers tens of billions of dol-
lars a year. 
Instead of recognizing and addressing 
ongoing issues with the Highway Trust 
Fund’s inevitable insolvency, this bill 
relies on deficit spending and adds to 
the taxpayers’ growing burdens at a 
time when many families are strug-
gling with the uncertainty created by 
the COVID–19 crisis. 
Instead of building the infrastructure 
Americans need, this bill gives priority 
to rail lines and urban hubs, even as 
Americans across the country begin to 
flee these high-cost areas. 
Instead of building a bipartisan con-
sensus to streamline the project review 
process, this bill binds the hands of 
States and localities and burdens the 
American public with unworkable man-
dates. 
Madam Speaker, at a time when nu-
merous other bills that had been 
brought to the floor carry a $1 trillion 
price tag, without offsetting cost, we 
must look for ways to rein in out-of- 
control 
spending. 
My 
amendment 
would inject a modicum of fiscal re-
search into this $1.5 trillion bill by re-
versing a Federal contracting policy 
that was designed to protect estab-
lished union work at the expense of 
would-be competitors, taxpayers, and 
our Nation’s investment in infrastruc-
ture. 
My amendment will allow us to con-
tinue 
to 
fund 
important 
highway 
projects by making commonsense re-
forms to lower the cost of infrastruc-
ture contracts funded by the American 
taxpayer. 
The Davis-Bacon Act requires Fed-
eral contractors and subcontractors to 
pay the local prevailing wage for con-
struction projects on which the Federal 
Government is a party. It sounds inno-
cent, but the devil is always in the de-
tails. The prevailing wage is severely 
dictated not by market forces but by 
the domination of union bargaining 
power. 
By using this metric, Congress is ef-
fectively pricing out any would-be 
competition for contracts and shield-
ing entrenched interests from competi-
tion. 
What is the result of Davis-Bacon, 
which was adopted before Federal min-
imum wage standards existed? Accord-
ing to a report from the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee, Davis-Bacon-deter-
mined wages tend to inflate labor costs 
an average of 22 percent above market 
rates. 
Additionally, research from Suffolk 
University found that Davis-Bacon re-
quirements cost U.S. taxpayers an ad-
ditional $8.6 billion annually and add 
9.9 percent to construction costs. 
The Congressional Budget Office has 
found that removing this burdensome 
mandate would free up $13 billion over 
10 years. Perhaps that is why the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office advo-
cated for its repeal over 40 years ago. 
I know Congress is often derelict in 
its duty, but that is simply inexcus-
able. These inflated costs mean bloated 
government spending and less bang for 
the taxpayers’ buck. 
Beyond requiring taxpayers to over-
pay for construction projects, Davis- 
Bacon requirements force businesses 
working on Federal highway projects 
to comply with burdensome paperwork 
and reporting regulations, which fur-
ther inflate costs and slow project com-
pletion. 
The premise of this bill is that it in-
vests in America. If that is the goal, 
then we must address this outdated

stumbling 
block 
to 
our 
Nation’s 
progress. 
Davis-Bacon 
concentrates 
wealth by government fiat instead of 
growing our economy. It artificially 
limits the number of construction 
projects in which we engage. Finally, it 
limits the number of jobs created. 
Madam Speaker, our economy needs 
expansion, 
not 
constraint. 
Federal 
spending needs efficiency, not bloated 
profit-making. People need jobs, not 
barriers to entry to employment. 
Madam Speaker, if we want invest-
ment, support my amendment and in-
ject our infrastructure projects with a 
healthy dose of the 21st century. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon is recognized for 15 
minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I am not quite certain what the gen-
tlewoman is objecting to. Now, I real-
ize her State has a $7.25 an hour min-
imum wage. Great, work 40 hours a 
week, live in abject poverty. Okay. 
So 
the 
wages 
for 
Davis-Bacon 
projects in her State aren’t much bet-
ter. These aren’t living wages. They 
aren’t family wages. They aren’t wages 
where you can go home to your family, 
not have to hold a second job, raise 
your kids, clothe them, send them to 
school, give them a good education, 
maybe help them pay for postsec-
ondary education. 
No, she is complaining about car-
penters 
under 
Davis-Bacon 
in 
her 
State, they earn $25,000 a year under 
Davis-Bacon. Wow. Wow. 25,000 bucks a 
year. That is outrageous. If they 
worked for the State minimum wage, 
we could get that down to less than 
$20,000 a year. That is great. What kind 
of carpenter are you going to get for 
that wage? I don’t think you are going 
to find any living in your State any-
more. 
Ironworkers, well, they get a bit 
more, kind of up there on the heights 
and all that. They get up to almost 
$28,000 a year. $28,000 a year for an iron-
worker? Amazing. 
Oh, and then truck drivers. The 
heavy truck drivers who work on con-
struction, they get $13.50 an hour. So 
she is alarmed at these outrageous 
wages that are being paid to these peo-
ple and how it is impinging upon 
projects in her State. Why, they could 
get lots of people to do that for $7.25 an 
hour. Of course, they wouldn’t have 
any skills, but what the heck. 
So, you know, what we have found, 
first off, these aren’t union negotiated, 
these are done by locale because, yes, 
these wages would be much higher in 
other areas. Apparently, in her State 
you can buy a house for 15 or $20,000 
down there or rent a nice apartment 
for 400, 300 bucks a month, so you can 
live on those kinds of wages. But other 
places it is not so inexpensive. 
And what we are trying to prevent is 
history. Low-bid contractors that often 
come in from out of State provide 
shoddy workmanship, but, yes, it was 
cheaper, it is cheaper. If you want a 
crappy job, hire somebody who is the 
low-bid contractor, who has unskilled 
people working for them. 
We are setting a standard here. Stud-
ies show that the most in any region 
around the country, because these are 
done in very discrete regions—there 
are quite a number of regions in her 
State, I was using the averages here; 
some of them are even lower, a few are 
higher. But the average, under a dis-
passionate analysis by the EPI, would 
be it could raise wages by as much as 
10 percent. Wages are one-quarter of 
the job cost. So 10 percent of one-quar-
ter would mean you would add 21⁄2 per-
cent to the job so people could have a 
decent living wage, decent benefits and 
raise a family, maybe even own a 
home, car. Wow. 
Of course, they couldn’t take transit 
to work if the Republicans were suc-
cessful in their version of this bill. 
You know, we found higher produc-
tivity that comes from this. This is a 
fight we have had many times on this 
floor, and I am afraid that there will be 
a number of Republicans who oppose 
her amendment. I certainly will be ask-
ing for a recorded vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, you know, the gentleman, I 
think, maligns the State of North 
Carolina. I didn’t think I would have to 
really stand here and defend what a 
wonderful State North Carolina is, but 
I think it is the fourth largest growing 
State in the country. People are com-
ing there in droves. It is considered one 
of the best States in the country for 
workers. The minimum wage may be 
$7.25, but I think we know only about 2 
percent of the people in this country 
are making the minimum wage, and 
they are entry level people. I think we 
are talking more about an average 
wage of about $20 an hour for people in 
North Carolina. So that is a straw dog 
that he is bringing up. 
We have a wonderful State, and peo-
ple are flocking there. The quality of 
life is great. And I will put up our qual-
ity of life in North Carolina against the 
quality of life in Oregon or anywhere 
else in the country as a great place to 
live. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I certainly did not mean to have her 
interpret I am disparaging her State. It 
is a beautiful State. I visited there. 
You have some fabulous breweries 
based there, one from Colorado and one 
from San Francisco because you have 
clean water. 
Of course, if one of these other 
amendments earlier is adopted, you 
would not have clean water and the 
breweries might go away, but that is 
okay, that is just a Republican philo-
sophical talking point. 
The gentlewoman said the average 
wage is $20 an hour, so I don’t know 
what she is concerned about. I have 
two pages of Davis-Bacon prevailing 
wages in North Carolina, and I only see 
one of about 50 entries that is $20.92 an 
hour, so it doesn’t seem there is much 
purpose to her amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JEFFRIES), the Chair of the Democratic 
Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee for yielding and for his tre-
mendous leadership as it relates to the 
Moving Forward Act. 
House Democrats throughout the 
116th Congress have been working on 
lowering healthcare costs and bigger 
paychecks leading with an emphasis on 
fixing our crumbling bridges, roads, 
tunnels, airports, mass transportation 
system, public schools, public housing, 
and all other aspects of infrastructure. 
I oppose this amendment because 
Davis-Bacon protections are central to 
the effort to deliver a living wage to 
everyday Americans. 
Here in this country, when you work 
hard and play by the rules, you should 
be able to provide a comfortable living 
for yourself and for your family. But 
that basic contract has been broken. It 
is broken because of the globalization 
of our economy. It is broken because of 
the outsourcing of good-paying Amer-
ican jobs. It is broken because of poor-
ly negotiated trade deals. It is broken 
because of the rise of automation. And 
it is broken because of the decline in 
unionization. 
So the central question that we face 
in the aftermath of the Great Reces-
sion and now in the midst of another 
dramatic economic decline is, will we 
be able to preserve the great American 
middle class and all those who aspire 
to be part of it? That is what Davis- 
Bacon prevailing wage protections are 
all about. And we on this side of the 
aisle stand with those everyday Ameri-
cans, stand with those hardworking 
Americans, 
yes, 
stand 
with 
those 
unionized Americans who are pursuing 
the American Dream, and we should be 
facilitating that, not undermining it 
here in the United States Congress. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ against this amendment. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Davis-Bacon stifles competition and 
discourages small and minority-owned 
businesses. 
Small 
business 
owners 
often do not have the financial re-
sources to bid on or win Davis-Bacon 
contracts. These restrictions mean less 
infrastructure and fewer jobs in Amer-
ica, but more jobs and higher pay only 
for 
union 
members, 
concentrating 
wealth in the hands of the few while 
many Americans are out of work. That

is something our colleagues seem to be 
opposed to in every other situation. 
Suspending 
this 
mandate 
would 
make each public construction dollar 
go at least 10 percent further. This 
would create more bridges and build-
ings at the same cost to taxpayers. It 
would also employ hundreds of thou-
sands more construction workers. 
Repealing these restrictions would 
allow the government to build more in-
frastructure and create 155,000 more 
construction-related jobs at the same 
cost to taxpayers. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to inquire as to the time 
left on either side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 81⁄4 minutes re-
maining. The gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has 71⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 30 seconds. 
I stand corrected. There are three 
categories out of 50 that get more than 
$20 an hour. Blaster. Do you want a 
blaster that earns $7.25 an hour? I don’t 
think so. That might not be too good. 
A crane rough, all terrain up there, 
they earn $21.25 an hour in North Caro-
lina. And a slipform machine, laying 
concrete. So there are three categories 
who could have their wages reduced or 
all of these people could have their 
wages reduced because many are at $14, 
$15, $16, $12 an hour even. 
And under her amendment, those 
protections go away. We can have a 
rush to the bottom. And she somehow 
is implying that minority contractors 
want to pay people less or will pay peo-
ple less or can’t afford to pay people. 
We have very strong disadvantaged 
business enterprise provisions in this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Iowa 
(Ms. 
FINKENAUER). 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I am proud to stand here today as a 
Congresswoman from Iowa’s First Con-
gressional District, but even more 
proud to stand here today as a daugh-
ter of a retired union pipe fitter/welder. 
And you see I brought something 
with me today of my dad’s. You can see 
right here it is a sweatshirt actually 
that he welded in. And you can see 
right here it has got these tiny little 
holes from the sparks of his welding 
torch. 
And I kept this sweatshirt actually 
with me when I was in the State House 
in Iowa for 4 years to remind me every 
single day of who I was fighting for and 
also to give me hope when the Repub-
licans in Iowa went after worker’s com-
pensation and collective bargaining in 
my State, making it harder for folks 
just like my dad. 
Today, I see Congressional Repub-
licans doing the same thing, pushing 
an amendment to gut Davis-Bacon pre-
vailing wage protections that will 
make life harder for working families 
like the one that I grew up in. 
And you see, I brought this with me 
today not because I need a reminder of 
who I am or where I come from, but 
clearly, my colleagues across the aisle 
in this body today need a reminder of 
the working men and women who have 
sacrificed day in and day out to provide 
good lives for their families who don’t 
complain when they get burned from 
the sparks of a welding torch, who 
don’t complain when they have to 
wring sweat out of their belt at the end 
of a hard day’s work, which I have seen 
my father do more times than I would 
like to count. 
You see, what they have done right 
now with this amendment and the pro-
posals that they have shown us this 
year are going after, again, the fami-
lies like the one that I grew up in. 
What they have done with amendments 
like this is to try to drive down wages 
and take away opportunities. 
This amendment is outrageous. With-
out Davis-Bacon how many more work-
ers busting their tails every day will 
see their paychecks go down and not 
up? How many more kids like me are 
going to go weeks without seeing their 
father or their mother? How many 
more families will be forced to leave 
their hometowns just to make ends 
meet? 
Republicans are trying to cut off ac-
cess to healthcare right now in the 
middle of a pandemic, and now they are 
trying to eliminate fair wage protec-
tions in the middle of an economic cri-
sis. 
This is outrageous, and quite frank-
ly, it is disrespectful. Working families 
are already struggling to get by. Mil-
lions have lost their jobs, and millions 
more are worried about their job secu-
rity. And now in the middle of this cri-
sis we are going to take away wage 
protections? Again, this isn’t just out-
rageous, it is disrespectful, and quite 
frankly, it is heartless. 
Please join me in defeating this 
amendment, voting ‘‘no’’ and actually 
showing working men and women 
across the country who really has their 
back. 
b 1245 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, under the nearly $500 billion 
surface transportation reauthorization 
piece of H.R. 2, the Highway Trust 
Fund, HTF, which pays for Federal 
highway and transit programs, it will 
require a $145 billion general fund bail-
out to cover the cost of the majority’s 
irresponsible spending decisions. 
Instead of trying to find a responsible 
way to pay for this huge increase in 
surface transportation funding and ad-
dress the HTF’s long-term solvency 
issues, the bill simply piles more debt 
onto future generations. 
Infrastructure is vital to our econ-
omy and the flow of commerce, but it 
is reckless to push such a massive bill 
that relies so heavily on more deficit 
spending, adds billions of dollars to 
programs without providing any re-
forms to reduce costs associated with 
the infrastructure project 
approval 
process, and ignores the Highway Trust 
Fund’s solvency issue. 
In addition, these partisan changes 
to our Federal transportation pro-
grams focus more on climate change 
and less on building infrastructure 
projects, creating more uncertainty for 
transportation workers and businesses. 
Rather than kicking the can down 
the road and burdening future genera-
tions with the spending habits of 
today, we need to recognize and ad-
dress inefficiencies that have lingered 
for far too long. 
By repealing the Davis-Bacon Act for 
transportation projects, we can stretch 
taxpayer dollars further while updat-
ing, improving, and advancing the de-
velopment of our Nation’s critical in-
frastructure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining 
on either side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 41⁄4 minutes re-
maining. The gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I

minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his leadership. 
We just heard from a daughter of a 
fitter out of the UA. I spent 37 years in 
the construction industry as an elec-
trician. 
We heard just the other day that 40 
percent of those who make $40,000 or 
less are out of work because of the pan-
demic, yet here we are, in the most de-
liberative body in the world, where a 
Member is saying: I want to represent 
my people by cutting their pay. 
Unbelievable that we are hearing 
this. 
They say we must modernize this 
system. Just because it is old doesn’t 
make it no good. I think many of us 
can understand that. 
They say they can save billions of 
dollars. Well, let’s think about why 
they want to do it. It is so they can 
take that billion dollars saved from 
workers out in the field, who are mak-
ing pennies an hour, and give it to bil-
lionaires like they did 2 years ago. 
Let’s understand this. They come be-
fore us to say: I want to hurt my con-
stituents. I want to pay them less. 
Unbelievable that somebody has the 
guts here on the House floor to say, ‘‘I 
want to screw my constituents by pay-
ing them less, no health benefits,’’ 
time after time. Unbelievable. 
This was almost 100 years ago, Sen-
ator Davis and Congressman BACON, 
signed by a Republican President. I 
guess that was back when Republicans 
had a conscience because what we are 
seeing now is an absolute farce. 
‘‘Let’s save money so we can build 
more roads.’’ 
My God, why don’t you go back and 
give them two bucks an hour so they 
can’t even live?

‘‘We will use them as pavement.’’ 
That is what I hear. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, you know, the at-
tacks on this amendment are truly 
uncalled for. No Republican is calling 
for people to be paid $2 an hour or to be 
abused, nobody. 
You know, our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, they have a 
right to their opinion but not to mak-
ing up things and not to putting words 
in our mouths. That is just uncalled 
for. 
So, I am not going to really dignify 
those comments by trying to respond 
to them except to say that. We are get-
ting sick and tired of people telling 
others what we think. 
Let’s just talk about what we do. And 
what this bill does is waste hard-
working taxpayer dollars, and that is 
what we are trying to protect. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 10 seconds. 
The gentlewoman says, save taxpayer 
dollars. What she wants to do is reduce 
the pay of skilled workers in America. 
That is not saving. They are taxpayers, 
by the way. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
amendment. 
And, quite frankly, I am dumb-
founded. You are aware that this con-
versation is in public. So I won’t put 
words in your mouth, but I will use 
your own words. 
You say today you don’t want to con-
solidate wealth amongst the few. What 
do you think your tax scam did? 
This is about workers. 
You say you are worried about deficit 
spending. Hallelujah. Suddenly you are 
worried about it. You weren’t worried 
about deficit spending when it came to 
endless wars. You weren’t worried 
about deficit spending when it came to 
a tax scam. 
This conversation is in public. You 
don’t get to go back to your districts 
now and say you are on the side of 
workers. 
But whose side are you on? Because 
there is one thing this amendment will 
do. It will boost corporate profits, it 
will put money in the hands of billion-
aires, and it will rip off workers. 
So today out in public, you reveal 
yourselves * * *. We are going to make 
sure that people remember this. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I ask for the gentleman’s 
words to be taken down. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I ask for the gentleman’s 
words to be taken down. I am not a 
hypocrite. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. * * * . 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. 
The Clerk will report the words. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. I would like 
to say that my colleagues across the 
aisle—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. Does the gen-
tleman wish to withdraw his remarks? 
Mr. ROSE of New York. No. * * *. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. 
The gentleman from New York is rec-
ognized. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. I did not 
mean any disrespect if I caused that. 
All right? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman ask unanimous consent to 
withdraw his words? 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Yes, of 
course. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. May I 
hear the gentleman say what he said 
again, please? I am sorry, someone was 
distracting me, Madam Speaker. I am 
only asking. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from New York please re-
peat his request? 
Mr. ROSE of New York. I am sorry I 
offended anybody and I withdraw. 
Thank you again. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. As I un-
derstand it, the gentleman is with-
drawing his remarks and asking for 
unanimous consent that his remarks be 
withdrawn. Is that correct? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is 
correct. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. No ob-
jection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the words are withdrawn. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. The gentlewoman has 
the right to close, so I am going to 
yield the balance of my time to my es-
teemed colleague from Michigan (Mr. 
KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Oregon, for yielding, but especially for 
leading us to this moment where we 
have the opportunity to do something 
big and meaningful that will put mil-
lions of Americans back to work in a 
meaningful way and stimulate this 
economy and also position us to lead in 
the 21st century. 
I will say this, however. We have 
been through this before. I have been 
here 8 years, and every year somebody 
from the other side comes down to this 
floor to offer the same amendment to 
take away an important protection 
that is actually quite simple. 
It just simply says people who work 
for a living ought to be paid a fair 
wage, a wage that is consistent with 
the prevailing wages in the community 
so that people don’t have to work full 
time and live in poverty, as tens of mil-
lions of Americans do right now. 
It is pretty straightforward. Thank-
fully, even when the Democrats were 
not in the majority, there were enough 
thoughtful Republicans on the other 
side who would join with us to protect 
workers. 
But I do find, and I know this is an 
issue that is very difficult for many of 
our Members to take, and it is an emo-
tional subject because it is the same 
Republican 
leadership 
that 
pushed 
through a tax bill that granted huge 
economic benefits to a very small num-
ber of people at the very top who now 
want to pull the rug from under work-
ing families. This can’t stand, and it 
won’t. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the jobs bill and tax 
cut bill which Republicans alone passed 
in 2017 cut taxes for low-income Ameri-
cans. Again, my colleagues are wel-
come to their opinions, but they are 
not welcome to make up facts, and 
that is what happened. The top 1 per-
cent of the people in this country pay 
more in taxes as a result of that bill. 
Madam Speaker, I grew up extremely 
poor in a house with no electricity and 
no running water. My father had to 
work away from home in the north. I 
grew up in North Carolina, and he was 
forced to be a member of a union and 
he hated it. He hated it because he had 
to pay union dues that supported poli-
cies he didn’t support. 
He was forced to take breaks. He was 
forced to slow down jobs. What he 
wanted to do was do his job and do it 
well and not come under the heavy 
hand of union bosses. I learned a long 
time ago about negative aspects of 
union membership from my father. 
But we are not here today to talk 
about personal issues; we are here to 
talk about the future of this country. 
I also am the lead Republican on the 
Education and Labor Committee, and I 
fought all of my life to help people gain 
the skills they need to get good jobs 
and better their lives. I am proud of 
what I have done over the years, and I 
will continue to do those things and 
focus on helping individuals become 
masters of their own lives and not be 
the subjects of anyone—not the unions, 
not the government, not anyone—but 
preserve their own freedom. 
We are here today to consider a mas-
sive progressive wish list. The majority 
has made no attempts to pay for any of 
the program increases or offset any of 
the other $1.5 trillion added to this bill, 
which puts the American people in 
debt. 
In the surface transportation provi-
sions, $2 out of every $5 is tied up in 
Green New Deal goals. Let’s be clear. 
Also, this bill has no chance of becom-
ing law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3031 
July 1, 2020 
With so many Americans already out 
of work because of the pandemic, this 
costly shift in our transportation pro-
grams creates more uncertainty and 
does nothing to address longstanding 
inefficiencies. 
Rather than pushing partisan wish 
lists 
that 
would 
heap 
enormous 
amounts of debt on future generations, 
we instead need to find commonsense 
solutions to modernize our infrastruc-
ture spending so we can get the most 
from every dollar invested. That is 
what Republicans want to do. We are 
not hypocrites. 
b 1300 
We believe, again, in freedom. We be-
lieve in what founded this country, the 
values that founded this country, and 
we are about to celebrate Independence 
Day. That is what we should be focused 
on: How do we do everything we can to 
celebrate independence and preserve 
that for the American people? 
One of the ways we do that is by not 
incurring more debt on their behalf. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in taking 
a step toward fiscal restraint by over-
turning this antiquated law from a by-
gone era. At this critical junction in 
our Nation’s history, we need to maxi-
mize our commitment to job creation, 
wise investment, equitable spending, 
and solutions to our unending deficit. 
Support my amendment to get the 
real investment in our Nation’s infra-
structure that our citizens deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the previous question 
is ordered on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. COURTNEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part H of House Report 116– 
438. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 499, after line 22, insert the following: 
SEC. 1632. VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMITATIONS. 
Section 127(a) of title 23, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following: 
‘‘(14) With respect to the State of Con-
necticut, laws and regulations in effect on 
October 1, 2013, shall be applicable for the 
purposes of this subsection.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1028, the gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURT-
NEY) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Connecticut. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, in 2013, the Con-
necticut General Assembly passed a 
law which was enacted that tried to 
modify and did modify, at least at the 
State level, the truck weight limits for 
agricultural producers, which, again, is 
sort of caught in a bit of a geographic 
box, given the fact that it is an 80,000 
limit in Connecticut, 127,000 in Massa-
chusetts for interstates, and 143,000 in 
the State of New York. 
This is a very densely concentrated 
part of the country, and almost all of 
their feed, almost all of their silage, a 
lot of their fuel, and a lot of their 
equipment comes in from out of State. 
So when you have got trucks that can 
carry 120,000 going down the Mass Pike 
and then enter Connecticut, you are 
suddenly having a very disruptive, ex-
pensive proposition in terms of actu-
ally needing more trucks or having to 
have the products offloaded. 
That is why the general assembly 
passed this statute. They thought they 
fixed it, but as, of course, we know 
here, in fact, Federal law has to be 
modified in order to make it effective. 
And that really was the purpose of this 
amendment. 
I had the support of the Governor and 
all of the relevant agencies in Wash-
ington. 
Truck weights are complicated. We 
know that, and I think we have really 
learned a lot in terms of this process. 
Again, I will be making a motion 
which I think will bring this event to a 
conclusion, but before I do that, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES), a great ad-
vocate for farms in the State of Con-
necticut, a member of the House Agri-
culture Committee, and someone who 
has been very involved in terms of try-
ing to help on this issue. 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Congressman 
COURTNEY
for 
yielding. 
Connecticut farmers are in dire need 
of this amendment. Connecticut’s agri-
cultural industry encompasses every-
thing from greenhouses to dairy farms. 
The greenhouse and nursery industry 
are the largest agricultural production 
sectors in the State, and they account 
for about $4.7 billion in Connecticut’s 
economy. But these are family farms, 
not large corporate farms. 
When they have to pay more to 
transport products due to unfair truck 
weight limits, there is a meaningful 
impact on their ability to stay afloat. 
For this reason, the Connecticut Legis-
lature passed a law in 2013 to allow for 
the increase in truck weights within 
the State. 
However, this change, as my col-
league Mr. COURTNEY says, requires a 
Federal fix to truly take effect. Put-
ting Federal policy in line with State 
policy would be a lifeline for my local 
farmers. We are not talking about a 
hypothetical benefit. We are talking 
about real, tangible benefits. 
This amendment would achieve par-
ity with neighboring States where 
weight limits are much higher. As you 
heard, in Connecticut, you can only 
carry up to 80,000 pounds, unlike our 
neighbors, Massachusetts, which is up 
to 127,000 pounds, and New York, which 
is up to 143,000 pounds. In order to do 
business with those States, it requires 
multiple, inefficient trips. 
This amendment is not just about 
fairness. It is about doing what makes 
sense for most of Connecticut’s agricul-
tural sector. This would be a vital life-
line for the industry that is the back-
bone of my State’s economy, and they 
are already struggling. 
I urge my colleagues to at least rec-
ognize the importance of this amend-
ment, and I thank my friend, Mr. 
COURTNEY, for his partnership in this 
effort. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, 
again, I think the gentlewoman de-
scribed very well the situation that is 
there. We obviously, as I said, learned 
a lot in this process in terms of maybe 
trying to get more reassurance about 
the precision of the definition of what 
are agricultural products, as well as 
making sure that the regulations in 
Connecticut are beefed up so that the 
maximum level of truck safety would 
be incorporated into any such change. 
As I said, it needs more work. 
I want to thank Mr. DEFAZIO for at 
least listening to us and Mr. MCGOVERN 
for making this amendment in order 
and Mr. GRAVES, again, for the work 
that he does on the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee. 
As a friend of mine once said when he 
was redirected out of a seat in the Con-
necticut Legislature: Don’t send me 
flowers, because I am coming back. 
Don’t send us flowers, because we 
want to really bring this issue, some-
time in the future, to Congress to try 
and help really great people who work 
every day, get up early, and are doing 
wonderful things in terms of food pro-
duction and agriculture products. 
I ask unanimous consent to withdraw 
this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MS. TLAIB 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 3 
printed in part H of House Report 116–

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment.

lows:

SEC. 33105. COMPREHENSIVE LEAD SERVICE 
LINE REPLACEMENT. 
Section 1459B of the Safe Drinking Water 
Act (42 U.S.C. 300j–19b) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (d)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘$60,000,000’’ and inserting 
‘‘$4,500,000,000’’; and 
(B) by striking ‘‘2021’’ and inserting ‘‘2025’’; 
and

‘‘(f) 
COMPREHENSIVE
LEAD

‘‘(1) 
GRANTS.—The

without requiring a contribution to the cost 
of replacement of any portion of the service 
line by any individual homeowner. 
‘‘(2) PRIORITY.—In making grants under

‘‘(3) NO COST-SHARING.—The Federal share

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1028, the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, first, I 
want to thank Speaker PELOSI
and 
Leader HOYER for their leadership in 
bringing this important bill to the 
floor. 
I would also like to thank Chairman 
PALLONE for working with me on this 
amendment and Chairpersons DeFazio, 
Waters, Scott, and others for their 
leadership; and my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives 
DAN
KILDEE, 
Slotkin, 
Cicilline, and Moore for their cospon-
sorship of this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my amendment because every-
one deserves clean water, because 
water is a human right. I rise today be-
cause, in the richest country in the 
world, no family or child should live 
with poisoned water. 
My amendment authorizes $4.5 bil-
lion annually, totaling $22.5 billion 
over the next 5 years, to replace dan-
gerous lead water pipes throughout our 
Nation. 
This 
amendment 
also 
prioritizes 
lead 
pipe 
replacement 
projects serving disadvantaged commu-
nities, communities of color, low-in-
come communities, and environmental 
justice 
communities 
like 
mine 
in 
Michigan’s 13th Congressional District. 
Our 
residents 
in 
Michigan, 
sur-
rounded by the largest bodies of fresh-
water in the world, should not be 
forced to live off bottled water sold by 
corporations like Nestle, who make bil-
lions while paying almost nothing to 
bottle our water and harm our eco-
system. 
Contaminated water has been a fact 
of life for too many communities, espe-
cially Black and Brown communities 
like Detroit, Flint, Baltimore, Chicago, 
and more. My amendment will require 
that lead service lines must be fully re-
placed and removed. No partial lead 
service line replacements would be 
funded. 
Our residents deserve so much more 
than half measures. We owe them their 
human right to drink clean water. This 
amendment, Madam Speaker, would 
change lives for over 9 million homes 
across the country currently at risk of 
facing the harms of lead exposure. 
The time for environmental justice is 
now, and this amendment is a crucial 
step toward finally achieving that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment. I urge them to tell every single 
individual, family, child, and commu-
nity in this country that they have a 
right to clean, safe water. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KIL-
DEE), my good colleague and fellow ac-
tivist on the human right to water. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague, Con-
gresswoman TLAIB, for her leadership 
and for bringing this amendment to the 
floor. I am proud to join her in it. 
As many of you know, I represent my 
hometown of Flint, Michigan. Flint is 
the community that really brought na-
tional attention to this issue of lead in 
drinking water. 
Fifteen thousand children were im-
pacted in Flint, Michigan, because of 
lead 
leaching 
into 
their 
drinking 
water. Those lead service lines were 
the source of that contamination. 
There is no safe level of lead in 
drinking water. Right now, we have a 
rule that allows for a certain level of 
lead. Many communities exceed it, but 
there is no safe level of lead in drink-
ing water, and we need to do every-
thing we can to eliminate it. This is a 
big step forward in dealing with it. 
And let me just remind my friends, 
yes, of course, this sort of initiative 
comes with a price tag. But if you real-
ly want to know the price of this issue, 
come to Flint and you will see the 
price of failure, the price of lead expo-
sure. 
It is not just measured in the half a 
billion dollars that it has cost to reme-
diate a problem that could have been 
solved if this program had been in 
place before, but the cost is measured 
in the effect that that lead exposure 
has had on developing small brains and 
the effect on the trajectory of the lives 
of those kids forever. 
You are not going to get a CBO score 
that measures the quality of life and 
the trajectory of the life of a child 
whose brain has been affected by expo-
sure to lead. We have a chance to do 
something about this. We have a 
chance to prevent the next Flint, 
Michigan. 
My people at home are tough, and 
they have been through a lot. They 
don’t want Flint to be an anomaly. It 
should be an example to the rest of the 
country. 
This is an important amendment 
that will make even better this bill 
that I support that invests in the fu-
ture of our country. 
I thank my colleague, Congress-
woman TLAIB, for her outstanding lead-
ership on this. 
b 1315 
Mr. SHIMKUS. I reserve the balance 
of my time, Madam Speaker. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to really understand the 
human impact of not having clean 
water around our country. This would 
help 11,000 communities across our Na-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
and vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I was here on the 
floor yesterday evening to debate the 
amendments under the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee’s 
jurisdiction 
that were airdropped into this Trans-
portation and Infrastructure bill. This 
is another one. Although the intent is 
good, it is a terrible amendment be-
cause it didn’t go through regular 
order. The committee of jurisdiction 
didn’t get a chance to understand it 
and debate it, and I will explain why. 
My constituents get tired of process 
arguments, and also a lot of Members 
get tired of that. We used to have some 
very powerful committees in this insti-
tution, and Members would develop 
subject-matter expertise through the 
years of hearings and detail-focused 
markups. When we moved bills through 
regular order it would help avoid unin-
tended consequences above bad public 
policy, and this amendment is another 
example of bad public policy. 
So while I appreciate the well-mean-
ing sentiments behind the sponsors, in-
cluding the emphasis the amendment 
places on prioritizing communities who 
cannot afford lead pipe replacements, 
the way this amendment is drafted 
leaves me with many questions about 
how it operates and that it won’t actu-
ally result in the claims of its spon-
sors. 
First, the amendment authorizes a 
brand-new comprehensive lead pro-
gram, which is not well-defined, on top 
of the existing lead reduction program 
which is defined. I am sure my col-
leagues don’t even know we have a lead 
reduction program right now under 
current law. 
We know the existing lead reduction 
program contains education and lead 
service line replacements. All we know

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3033 
July 1, 2020 
about the comprehensive lead program 
is that it pays to remove lead service 
lines. This seems like less but calling 
it comprehensive certainly suggests 
more. 
In addition, this amendment author-
izes $4.5 billion per year for both pro-
grams. Does this mean $4.44 billion is 
supposed to go to the new, undefined 
comprehensive program and $60 million 
to the existing defined lead reduction 
program? 
Are they supposed to be treated 
equally? 
On the question of funding, the 
amount authorized to be spent in 1 
year is 300 percent more than the en-
tire amount of Federal funding for 
major drinking water aid programs. It 
is actually about one-half of the EPA’s 
entire annual budget. 
The regular lead reduction program 
which was authorized at $60 million per 
year and took 4 years to establish is 
now just starting to award funds. Since 
the comprehensive program is a sepa-
rate program, we can expect this pro-
gram to take longer to get going, but 
in reality, pushing this unprecedented 
level of funding out the door might be 
aspirational rather than realistic. That 
would be a shame for those commu-
nities who need it most. 
Second, the amendment waives any 
requirements for matching funds from 
the water systems or communities that 
obtain them. On top of that, this 
amendment waives any requirement 
for any person to pay for replacement 
of their personally-owned portion of 
lead service lines, whereas the existing 
program waives this expense for low-in-
come people. This means people who 
have the financial resources to afford 
their own replacements don’t have to 
use them at all because the new com-
prehensive program will pick up the 
check for them. That is not very pro-
gressive. Compensating the wealthy for 
these replacements both now and in 
the future is an especially harsh con-
sequence for U.S. taxpayers, but that is 
what this amendment does. 
Flint was a failure at all levels, and 
it happened because of money in poli-
tics. The city of Flint wanted off De-
troit water because they felt they were 
being gouged on their rates. 
The city council set an artificial po-
litical deadline for transition that 
wasn’t based on the engineering needs 
of the system’s water chemistry. 
The State cut the city slack because 
the city was in receivership and didn’t 
pursue enforcement. 
EPA was aware of the high-level 
readings but minimized their impact to 
avoid causing a panic and slowed- 
walked the legal response. 
The biggest problem was that no one 
told the public. 
Flint suffered because of that, and 
the people living in the most neglected 
areas of Flint suffered the most. 
So while this amendment guarantees 
priority funding for cities and water 
utilities for low-income folks, this 
amendment does not mandate that 
these households get their lead service 
lines replaced first or that they target 
the worst contamination. Let me re-
peat that. Under this amendment, you 
can be the reason your city or utility 
gets moved to the front of the line, but 
that city does not have to replace the 
poorest and most dangerous lead serv-
ice lines. 
This is another example of why we 
shouldn’t stick safe drinking water 
amendments on a transportation bill. 
It bastardizes the process and creates 
poor public policy like this amend-
ment. 
I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
In fact, Chairman DEFAZIO
in the 
Rules Committee once said: I have no 
idea what these amendments mean be-
cause I had no jurisdiction on this 
process. 
So with that, Madam Speaker, vote 
‘‘no’’ on this very poorly drafted 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in strong support of the Tlaib/ 
Kildee/Slotkin/Cicilline/Moore amendment to 
help remove dangerous lead pipes in our com-
munities. 
Lead paint in housing and water infrastruc-
ture containing lead are the two primary, but 
not the sole, pathways for lead poisoning in 
our children. 
HUD estimates that over 22 million homes 
(34 percent of the homes built before 1978) 
have significant lead-based paint hazards. Na-
tionwide, estimates are that there are as many 
as 10 million lead service lines. 
The pernicious impacts of lead poisoning 
are well known. These impacts are often life-
long and irreversible. Lead poisoning is a seri-
ous threat in the State of Wisconsin and par-
ticularly in the City of Milwaukee, which has 
the largest concentration of lead service lines 
in the state. And its not just my state. Accord-
ing to the Great Lakes Governor’s and Pre-
miers, the Great Lakes region contains the 
highest concentrations of lead service lines in 
the United States. 
The good news is that lead poisoning is pre-
ventable, not inevitable, if we act. It is critical 
that we start taking steps to boost assistance, 
especially to localities with extremely high 
numbers of households served by lead lateral 
lines, who are least able to pay for the re-
placement of those lines. 
That’s what this amendment does. 
This amendment would authorize $4.5 bil-
lion dollars per year for 5 years to help pay to 
fully replace lead service lines across the 
country with a priority given to low-income and 
other communities that suffer disproportion-
ately from the harms posed by this threat. 
A sustained substantial commitment to fed-
eral lead prevention and mitigation efforts is 
critical if our country is to make serious 
progress in protecting our nation’s children. 
That’s what this amendment does. It raises 
the federal investment and makes changes to 
ensure that more households can participate 
in comprehensive lead reduction projects that 
fully replace lead lines. 
Unfortunately, the households most affected 
by this problem often have the fewest re-
sources available to pay to replace lead pipes. 
It reaffirms a federal commitment to helping 
get lead pipes out of the ground. Primary pre-
vention—the removal of lead hazards from the 
environment before a child is exposed—is the 
most effective way to ensure that children do 
not experience the harmful effects of lead ex-
posure. These funds will help to ensure that 
children can grow up healthy and safe while 
living in homes where they are protected from 
lead poisoning. 
For this small investment, our communities 
reap great gains. The annual costs of lead 
poisoning have been estimated at over $50 
billion. As noted in a report by the Pew Chari-
table Trusts, ‘‘In the absence of lead, hun-
dreds of thousands of children would be more 
likely to realize their full potential thanks to 
higher GPAs, a better chance of earning high 
school diplomas and graduating. 
This amendment gets us closer to riding our 
communities of lead service lines and to pro-
viding a healthier tomorrow for millions of chil-
dren and their families. I urge my colleagues 
to support it.

ant to the rule, the previous question

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). Pursuant to the rule, the 
previous question is ordered on the bill, 
as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
am opposed to the bill in its current 
form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Crawford moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 2 to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure with instructions to re-
port the same back to the House forthwith, 
with the following amendment: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
DIVISION N—STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES 
SEC. 91001. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES PROHI-
BITION. 
(a) BUY AMERICA.—None of the funds au-
thorized or made available by this Act, or 
the amendments made by this Act, may be 
used in awarding a contract, subcontract, 
grant, or loan to an entity that— 
(1) is owned or controlled by, is a sub-
sidiary of, or is otherwise related legally or 
financially to a corporation based in a coun-
try that— 
(A) is identified as a nonmarket economy 
country (as defined in section 771(18) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18))) as of 
the date of enactment of this Act; 
(B) was identified by the United States 
Trade Representative in the most recent re-
port required by section 182 of the Trade Act 
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242) as a priority foreign 
country under subsection (a)(2) of that sec-
tion; and 
(C) is subject to monitoring by the Trade 
Representative under section 306 of the 
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416); or 
(2) is listed pursuant to section 9(b)(3) of 
the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 
(Public Law 116–145). 
(b) EXCEPTION.—For purposes of subsection 
(a), the term ‘‘otherwise related legally or fi-
nancially’’ does not include a minority rela-
tionship or investment. 
(c) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.—This sec-
tion shall be applied in a manner consistent 
with the obligations of the United States 
under international agreements. 
Mr. CRAWFORD (during the read-
ing). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas is recognized for 5 minutes in 
support of his motion. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, 
this amendment will not kill the bill, 
but will instead ensure that the Demo-
crats’ partisan wish list does not result 
in a windfall for the Chinese state- 
owned enterprises. 
This amendment would prevent com-
panies owned or controlled by the Chi-
nese regime or the Chinese Communist 
Party from participating in any project 
or receiving any fund authorized by 
this bill. 
This is particularly important given 
the hundreds of billions of dollars for 
programs like power grid transmission 
and 
distribution 
projects 
and 
broadband infrastructure investment. 
We can’t afford to allow the Chinese 
Government to take control of our 
power grid or broadband system, and 
we all know that allowing Chinese 
companies 
to 
compete 
for 
these 
projects often opens the door to Chi-
nese Government control. 
Time and time again, China has dem-
onstrated its hostility to America’s in-
terests and international standards of 
transparency and accountability, while 
violating basic human morality. 
China’s industrial plan makes their 
goal clear: Dominate global innovation 
and manufacturing by any means nec-
essary. China is buying and stealing 
American 
technology 
explicitly 
to 
overtake our semiconductor, robotic, 
and electric vehicle industries. 
Already, China owns a majority of 
the world’s lithium-ion battery produc-
tion, more than 60 percent. And the 
Chinese Government is continually in-
vesting to increase that capacity. Al-
ready, China exports the most lithium- 
ion batteries and components of any 
other country, more than 6 times what 
the United States exports. 
And Chinese Government subsidies 
are slated to expand their battery pro-
duction more than 21⁄2 times by 2026. 
We have seen what happens when 
Chinese-Government sponsored compa-
nies like Huawei gain a foothold with 
telecom products, we succumb to state- 
directed domination of a U.S. industry, 
and we leave ourselves vulnerable to 
national security threats, espionage, 
and IP theft. 
Without ensuring that this bill’s $1.5 
trillion spending spree on electric vehi-
cles and other technologies are manu-
factured by American companies or 
countries that play by the rules, we 
will simply be aiding China in achiev-
ing its goals. 
The issue of protecting our critical 
infrastructure is a goal many of us 
share. 
In fact, the White House has already 
taken action to prevent foreign infil-
tration of our power grid through an 
executive order on bulk power systems 
earlier this year, and is working with 
industry to phase out the use of tech-
nology produced in China. 
However, I make this motion not just 
because of China’s economic policies. 
The Chinese Government is responsible 
for: government censorship of publica-
tions, media, and social media; 
The blatant theft of American intel-
lectual property; 
Refusal to abide by World Trade Or-
ganization rules; 
Choosing 
not 
to 
report 
the 
coronavirus outbreak for months; and 
Frequent mistreatment of minority 
ethic groups within its borders. 
Just this week, Madam Speaker, we 
learned that in addition to the many 
atrocities China has committed against 
the Uighur people, it is now commit-
ting genocide. 
Hundreds of thousands of women are 
being subjected to nonconsensual im-
plantation of birth control, forced ster-
ilization, and even forced abortion of 
their unborn children. 
We have a moral obligation to ensure 
that no government treats its citizens 
this way, and none of its state-spon-
sored companies that help them do it 
benefit from the majority’s spending 
spree. 
But that is what we are doing if we 
pass this massive spending bill that en-
courages purchasing products mined 
and manufactured in China. We invest 
in their companies and sponsor their 
tyranny rather than supporting Amer-
ican workers and families. 
Madam Speaker, a Democrat amend-
ment applying these restrictions to a 
portion of the bill already passed 62 to 
1 during the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee markup.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3037 
July 1, 2020 
In an otherwise hyper-partisan mark-
up, where Democrats refused to accept 
many Republican-led amendments, it 
was perhaps the most bipartisan mo-
ment—the 
‘‘where’s 
the 
meatloaf,’’ 
mute violation notwithstanding—sup-
ported by Chairman DEFAZIO. We can 
do that again here, Madam Speaker. 
Adopting this amendment will not 
kill the bill and not stop the majority 
from sending its wish list on to the 
Senate with no plan to pay for it. 
But the bare minimum we can do is 
come together to say that as we build 
American infrastructure we also build 
up America, not China. 
During the markup of H.R. 2, the 
chairman said he didn’t care if China 
was listening in on our discussions, so 
let’s send a clear message to China 
now. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, if 
only we had a President who would 
take meaningful action against China. 
It has recently been revealed that the 
President—regular 
order, 
Madam 
Chair, I hear some kind of wiggling on 
that side—whining, whining. Okay. 
Yeah, we just recently found out that 
he begged Premier Xi Jinping to buy 
more farm products to help his reelec-
tion. 
And, by the way, he said he liked the 
prison camps, he thought they were a 
good idea. He actually said that. 
So, you know, if we had a President 
who would act against dictators. Putin 
murdering U.S. troops, while he is still 
cozying up to Putin. 
So, you know, anything with China is 
a result of the MFN for China, which 
granted, came under President Bill 
Clinton. I voted against it. A large ma-
jority of Republicans voted for it. Per-
haps we have a different group of Re-
publicans here now who wouldn’t have 
voted for MFN for China, or would sup-
port my resolution to withdraw from 
the WTO because of the WTO and the 
dominance of China and its lack of ef-
fectiveness. And I hope to have that 
vote later this year, although it was 
precluded during this time period by 
the Rules Committee. 
So we have the most stringent Buy 
America requirements of any part of 
the government in the Transportation 
and Infrastructure sections of this bill. 
Most stringent. We closed the last 
loopholes for transit and rail being 
used by Communist government-owned 
or controlled corporations in China. We 
have done that. 
And, you know, it is time to bring 
things back to the United States of 
America. Bring back pharmaceutical 
production. Let’s stop being driven by 
the pharmaceutical industry here. 
I still remember the Medicaid part D 
vote, the Republican bill, it prohibited 
the government from negotiating lower 
drug prices because Big Pharma runs 
this place on that side of the aisle. 
And now here we have—all of a sud-
den we developed a concern about 
human rights and China. Well, you 
have been pretty absent for the last, 
oh, let’s see, when you were in the ma-
jority until very recently—60 percent 
of my career has been in the minority. 
So the last time you held the majority 
for 10 years or so, you didn’t do any-
thing on any of these things. You had 
President Bush, he didn’t do anything 
on these things. You have President 
Trump who is cozying up to the dic-
tator of China. And now you come 
here, and say, Oh, we are going to fix 
all this with this vote. 
We have taken the strongest, strong-
est stand in the infrastructure sections 
of this bill, and it is fully within the 
rights of the President to take further 
action to punish China for these sorts 
of things. 
Madam Speaker, I recommend a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, is 
it appropriate for the gentleman to 
make comments about the President of 
the United States on the floor as he 
did? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair is not going to offer an advisory 
opinion. 
Without objection, the previous ques-
tion is ordered on the motion to recom-
mit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law clarify certain obligations and promises 
that the Government of China has made with 
respect to the future of Hong Kong. 
(2) The obligations of the Government of 
China under the Joint Declaration were codi-
fied in a legally-binding treaty, signed by the 
Government of the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and registered 
with the United Nations. 
(3) The obligations of the Government of 
China under the Basic Law originate from 
the Joint Declaration, were passed into the 
domestic law of China by the National Peo-
ple’s Congress, and are widely considered by 
citizens of Hong Kong as part of the de facto 
legal constitution of Hong Kong. 
(4) Foremost among the obligations of the 
Government of China to Hong Kong is the 
promise that, pursuant to Paragraph 3b of 
the Joint Declaration, ‘‘the Hong Kong Spe-
cial Administrative Region will enjoy a high 
degree of autonomy, except in foreign and 
defence affairs which are the responsibilities 
of the Central People’s Government’’. 
(5) The obligation specified in Paragraph 
3b of the Joint Declaration is referenced, re-
inforced, and extrapolated on in several por-
tions of the Basic Law, including Articles 2, 
12, 13, 14, and 22. 
(6) Article 22 of the Basic Law establishes 
that ‘‘No department of the Central People’s 
Government and no province, autonomous 
region, or municipality directly under the 
Central Government may interfere in the af-
fairs which the Hong Kong Special Adminis-
trative Region administers on its own in ac-
cordance with this Law.’’. 
(7) The Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law make clear that additional obligations 
shall be undertaken by China to ensure the 
‘‘high degree of autonomy’’ of Hong Kong. 
(8) Paragraph 3c of the Joint Declaration 
states, as reinforced by Articles 2, 16, 17, 18, 
19, and 22 of the Basic Law, that Hong Kong 
‘‘will be vested with executive, legislative 
and independent judicial power, including 
that of final adjudication’’. 
(9) On multiple occasions, the Government 
of China has undertaken actions that have 
contravened the letter or intent of the obli-
gation described in paragraph (8) of this sec-
tion, including the following: 
(A) In 1999, the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress overruled a deci-
sion by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal 
on the right of abode. 
(B) On multiple occasions, the Government 
of Hong Kong, at the advice of the Govern-
ment of China, is suspected to have not al-
lowed persons entry into Hong Kong alleg-
edly because of their support for democracy 
and human rights in Hong Kong and China. 
(C) The Liaison Office of China in Hong 
Kong has, despite restrictions on inter-
ference in the affairs of Hong Kong as de-
tailed in Article 22 of the Basic Law— 
(i) openly expressed support for candidates 
in Hong Kong for Chief Executive and Legis-
lative Council; 
(ii) expressed views on various policies for 
the Government of Hong Kong and other in-
ternal matters relating to Hong Kong; and 
(iii) on April 17, 2020, asserted that both 
the Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong and 
the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of 
the State Council ‘‘have the right to exercise 
supervision . . . on affairs regarding Hong 
Kong and the mainland, in order to ensure 
correct implementation of the Basic Law’’. 
(D) The National People’s Congress has 
passed laws requiring Hong Kong to pass 
laws banning disrespectful treatment of the 
national flag and national anthem of China. 
(E) The State Council of China released a 
white paper on June 10, 2014, that stressed 
the ‘‘comprehensive jurisdiction’’ of the Gov-
ernment of China over Hong Kong and indi-
cated that Hong Kong must be governed by 
‘‘patriots’’. 
(F) The Government of China has directed 
operatives to kidnap and bring to the main-
land, or is otherwise responsible for the kid-
napping of, residents of Hong Kong, includ-
ing businessman Xiao Jianhua and book-
seller Gui Minhai. 
(G) The Government of Hong Kong, acting 
with the support of the Government of 
China, introduced an extradition bill that 
would have permitted the Government of 
China to request and enforce extradition re-
quests for any individual present in Hong 
Kong, regardless of the legality of the re-
quest or the degree to which it compromised 
the judicial independence of Hong Kong. 
(H) The spokesman for the Standing Com-
mittee of the National People’s Congress 
said, ‘‘Whether Hong Kong’s laws are con-
sistent with the Basic Law can only be 
judged and decided by the National People’s 
Congress Standing Committee. No other au-
thority has the right to make judgments and 
decisions.’’. 
(10) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
states, as reinforced by Article 5 of the Basic 
Law, that the ‘‘current social and economic 
systems in Hong Kong will remain un-
changed, as so will the life-style.’’. 
(11) On multiple occasions, the Govern-
ment of China has undertaken actions that 
have contravened the letter or intent of the 
obligation described in paragraph (10) of this 
section, including the following: 
(A) In 2002, the Government of China pres-
sured the Government of Hong Kong to in-
troduce ‘‘patriotic’’ curriculum in primary 
and secondary schools. 
(B) The governments of China and Hong 
Kong proposed the prohibition of discussion 
of Hong Kong independence and self-deter-
mination in primary and secondary schools, 
which infringes on freedom of speech. 
(C) The Government of Hong Kong man-
dated that Mandarin, and not the native lan-
guage of Cantonese, be the language of in-
struction in Hong Kong schools. 
(D) The governments of China and Hong 
Kong agreed to a daily quota of mainland 
immigrants to Hong Kong, which is widely 
believed by citizens of Hong Kong to be part 
of an effort to ‘‘mainlandize’’ Hong Kong. 
(12) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
states, as reinforced by Articles 4, 26, 27, 28, 
29, 30, 31, 32 33, 34, and 39 of the Basic Law, 
that the ‘‘rights and freedoms, including 
those of person, of speech, of the press, of as-
sembly, of association, of travel, of move-
ment, of correspondence, of strike, of choice 
of occupation, of academic research and of 
religious belief will be ensured by law’’ in 
Hong Kong. 
(13) On multiple occasions, the Govern-
ment of China has undertaken actions that 
have contravened the letter or intent of the 
obligation described in paragraph (12) of this 
section, including the following: 
(A) On February 26, 2003, the Government 
of Hong Kong introduced a national security 
bill that would have placed restrictions on 
freedom of speech and other protected rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3041 
July 1, 2020 
(B) The Liaison Office of China in Hong 
Kong has pressured businesses in Hong Kong 
not to advertise in newspapers and maga-
zines critical of the governments of China 
and Hong Kong. 
(C) The Hong Kong Police Force selec-
tively blocked demonstrations and protests 
expressing opposition to the governments of 
China and Hong Kong or the policies of those 
governments. 
(D) The Government of Hong Kong refused 
to renew work visa for a foreign journalist, 
allegedly for hosting a speaker from the 
banned Hong Kong National Party. 
(E) The Justice Department of Hong Kong 
selectively prosecuted cases against leaders 
of the Umbrella Movement, while failing to 
prosecute police officers accused of using ex-
cessive force during the protests in 2014. 
(F) On April 18, 2020, the Hong Kong Police 
Force arrested 14 high-profile democracy ac-
tivists and campaigners for their role in or-
ganizing a protest march that took place on 
August 18, 2019, in which almost 2,000,000 peo-
ple rallied against a proposed extradition 
bill. 
(14) Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law as-
sert that the selection of Chief Executive 
and all members of the Legislative Council 
of Hong Kong should be by ‘‘universal suf-
frage.’’. 
(15) On multiple occasions, the Govern-
ment of China has undertaken actions that 
have contravened the letter or intent of the 
obligation described in paragraph (14) of this 
section, including the following: 
(A) In 2004, the National People’s Congress 
created new, antidemocratic procedures re-
stricting the adoption of universal suffrage 
for the election of the Chief Executive of 
Hong Kong. 
(B) The decision by the National People’s 
Congress on December 29, 2007, which ruled 
out universal suffrage in 2012 elections and 
set restrictions on when and if universal suf-
frage will be implemented. 
(C) The decision by the National People’s 
Congress on August 31, 2014, which placed 
limits on the nomination process for the 
Chief Executive of Hong Kong as a condition 
for adoption of universal suffrage. 
(D) On November 7, 2016, the National Peo-
ple’s Congress interpreted Article 104 of the 
Basic Law in such a way to disqualify 6 
elected members of the Legislative Council. 
(E) In 2018, the Government of Hong Kong 
banned the Hong Kong National Party and 
blocked the candidacy of pro-democracy can-
didates. 
(16) The ways in which the Government of 
China, at times with the support of a subser-
vient Government of Hong Kong, has acted 
in contravention of its obligations under the 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as set 
forth in this section, are deeply concerning 
to the people of Hong Kong, the United 
States, and members of the international 
community who support the autonomy of 
Hong Kong. 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING HONG 
KONG. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States continues to uphold 
the principles and policy established in the 
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
(22 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) and the Hong Kong 
Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 
(Public Law 116–76; 22 U.S.C. 5701 note), 
which remain consistent with China’s obliga-
tions under the Joint Declaration and cer-
tain promulgated objectives under the Basic 
Law, including that— 
(A) as set forth in section 101(1) of the 
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
(22 U.S.C. 5711(1)), ‘‘The United States should 
play an active role, before, on, and after July 
1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong’s con-
fidence and prosperity, Hong Kong’s role as 
an international financial center, and the 
mutually beneficial ties between the people 
of the United States and the people of Hong 
Kong.’’; and 
(B) as set forth in section 2(5) of the United 
States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 
U.S.C. 5701(5)), ‘‘Support for democratization 
is a fundamental principle of United States 
foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies 
to United States policy toward Hong Kong. 
This will remain equally true after June 30, 
1997.’’; 
(2) although the United States recognizes 
that, under the Joint Declaration, the Gov-
ernment of China ‘‘resumed the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect on 1 
July 1997’’, the United States supports the 
autonomy of Hong Kong in furtherance of 
the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 
1992 and the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act of 2019 and advances the de-
sire of the people of Hong Kong to continue 
the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ regime, in 
addition to other obligations promulgated by 
China under the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law; 
(3) in order to support the benefits and pro-
tections that Hong Kong has been afforded 
by the Government of China under the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law, the United 
States should establish a clear and unambig-
uous set of penalties with respect to foreign 
persons determined by the Secretary of 
State, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Treasury, to be involved in the con-
travention of the obligations of China under 
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and 
the financial institutions transacting with 
those foreign persons; 
(4) the Secretary of State should provide 
an unclassified assessment of the reason for 
imposition of certain economic penalties on 
entities, so as to permit a clear path for the 
removal of economic penalties if the sanc-
tioned behavior is reversed and verified by 
the Secretary of State; 
(5) relevant Federal agencies should estab-
lish a multilateral sanctions regime with re-
spect to foreign persons involved in the con-
travention of the obligations of China under 
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law; 
and 
(6) in addition to the penalties on foreign 
persons, 
and 
financial 
institutions 
transacting with those foreign persons, for 
the contravention of the obligations of China 
under the Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law, the United States should take steps, in 
a time of crisis, to assist permanent resi-
dents of Hong Kong who are persecuted or 
fear persecution as a result of the contraven-
tion by China of its obligations under the 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law to be-
come eligible to obtain lawful entry into the 
United States. 
SEC. 5. IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN PERSONS 
INVOLVED IN THE EROSION OF THE

confidential basis; 
(B) to jeopardize the integrity or success of 
an ongoing criminal investigation or pros-
ecution; 
(C) to endanger the life or physical safety 
of any person; or 
(D) to cause substantial harm to physical 
property. 
(3) NOTIFICATION REQUIRED.—If the Director 
of National Intelligence makes a determina-
tion under paragraph (1) or the Attorney

propriate

pointment, pursuant to section 703(c) 
of the Public Interest Declassification 
Act of 2000 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note), and the

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AMERICA 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
as America approaches her birthday, I 
want to wish the American people, in 
this most challenging time, a happy 
birthday. 
I want to be reminded of those whose 
status in this country is not a status of 
equality, but I do want to acknowledge 
the importance of the birthday and the 
freedom and democracy in this Nation. 
I want to thank the men and women 
of the United States military, and I 
want to acknowledge that any threat 
against those in the United States 
military is a serious threat. Any Com-
mander in Chief that initially assesses 
a threat as a hoax should not be in that 
position. 
The Russian threat of bounty on our 
soldiers in Afghanistan must be fully 
investigated by every jurisdictional 
committee in the United States Con-
gress, but there must be a response to 
Russia, because those soldiers are pre-
cious and they are precious in the fight 
for freedom and to their families and to 
this Nation. 
Again, as we wish a happy birthday, 
let us be reminded that those who have 
fallen in battle have fallen to continue 
to build on the democracy and the jus-
tice that we fought for and to make 
those who are yet equal, equal in the 
eyes of the law. We continue to fight. 
We must continue to defend our sol-
diers as they defend us. 
Happy birthday, America.

DEFENDING POLICE 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, just 
a year ago, south Mississippi mourned 
the senseless murder of Officer Robert 
McKeithen, and this month, Mississippi 
lost one of our sheriff’s deputies, James 
Blair, in the line of duty. 
Despite the dangers from criminals 
and lawlessness in our communities, 
some in America continue to call for 
defunding and dismantling police de-
partments across the country. While 
we watched stores looted and cities 
burned by street thugs and anarchists, 
the men and women of law enforcement 
were labeled as the enemy. 
Madam Speaker, police officers are 
not the enemy. They are the thin blue 
line standing between good and evil, 
civilization and chaos. I stand here 
today in 100 percent support of defend-
ing 
our 
police 
officers 
and 
not 
defunding them. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all the good 
citizens of America to stand up and do 
the same. Defunding law enforcement 
is not the answer to the problems of 
this country. Removing criminals from 
our streets is. 
May God bless the men and women in 
blue and their families. 
f 
ONE $1,200 CHECK IS NOT ENOUGH 
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to reemphasize 
the urgent need for the U.S. Senate to 
pass the HEROES Act. 
Communities 
across 
the 
country 
have been and continue to be ravaged 
by the health and economic impacts of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. One $1,200 
check is not enough to cover 3 months 
of expenses for millions of out-of-work 
Americans, and many families are still 
missing a check. 
Millions of Americans are behind on 
rent and unable to pay their bills, wor-
ried they may be evicted from their 
homes. Frontline workers are risking 
their lives and the lives of their loved 
ones to ensure that our communities 
and our people can continue to thrive. 
The coronavirus is resurging across 
the country, and this administration is 
shutting down Federal testing sites in 
impacted communities. 
The HEROES Act will provide pay-
ments to families, create a national 
moratorium on evictions and fore-
closures, provide hazard pay for front-
line workers, and provide billions for 
testing and contact tracing. 
While Americans suffer from this cri-
sis, the leadership on the Senate side 
sits behind his desk, refusing to hold 
votes on a bill that will provide sup-
port and relief for millions of Ameri-
cans in need. 
Madam Speaker, it is time for Sen-
ator MCCONNELL to lead with empathy 
and pass this legislation.

hardest 
hit

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3045 
July 1, 2020 
coronavirus, I know, now more than 
ever, we must pass this landmark bill 
into law, and do it now. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF COACH 
CHARLES RIPLEY 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of one of Arkansas’ great coaching leg-
ends, Mr. Charles Ripley, who passed 
away this week at the age of 74. 
In his 27-year tenure at the Little 
Rock School District, Coach Ripley led 
the Parkview Patriots to five boys 
State basketball titles and an overall 
record of 487–152. 
In 1995, Coach Ripley was hired as the 
head basketball coach of Westark Com-
munity College in Fort Smith and then 
returned to Little Rock to serve as the 
athletic director and men’s basketball 
coach at Arkansas Baptist College. 
Coach Rip is a real hero to so many 
in our community and is in the Arkan-
sas Sports Hall of Fame. 
The Arkansas Baptist College Foun-
dation has established the Rip It Schol-
arship Fund to fund and honor his long- 
time efforts to fund and assist student- 
athletes at Arkansas Baptist College. 
I join all Arkansans in honoring this 
remarkable life. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to say 
that I congratulate the House on con-
curring with the Senate on extending 
the PPP program date until August 8. 
This will help small businesses all over 
our country. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS MAKES NEED FOR 
AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE VITAL 
(Mrs. FLETCHER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care En-
hancement Act. 
At this unprecedented moment in our 
country’s history, when the novel 
coronavirus has made plain the vital 
need 
for 
affordable 
and 
accessible 
healthcare for people across our coun-
try, I was proud to cast my vote in 
favor of this bill, which builds on the 
Affordable Care Act. 
Ten years ago, the Affordable Care 
Act expanded access to healthcare for 
millions across Texas and across the 
country. Since that time, we have also 
learned of critical improvements need-
ed to the ACA to ensure that care is 
both affordable and accessible. 
This bill lowers the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs, caps premiums, and pro-
tects people with preexisting condi-
tions. 
Vitally important for Texas, with the 
highest rate of uninsured people in the 
country, this bill encourages States 
that haven’t expanded Medicaid to do 
so. And I will work with leaders in 
Texas to make sure that we do. 
These are priorities for people across 
my district, across my State, and 
across our country. As we battle this 
public health crisis, I am glad the leg-
islation that is necessary and timely 
has passed the House, and I urge the 
Senate to do the same. 
f 
MOVING FORWARD ON PATH TO 
SUSTAINABILITY 
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, today, the House of Rep-
resentatives took a significant step for-
ward for the American people by pass-
ing the Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 tril-
lion legislative package to invest in 
America’s infrastructure and create 
jobs. I am proud to support this legisla-
tion. 
Among other things, this package 
will help combat the climate crisis and 
grow clean energy jobs. It includes my 
Public Land Renewable Energy Devel-
opment Act, which facilitates renew-
able energy development on public 
lands and sets a goal to develop 25 
gigawatts of renewable energy genera-
tion on our public lands by 2025. 
I also worked to ensure that the 
package includes local priorities like 
my Desalination Development Act, 
which will provide Federal funding for 
desalination projects like those in my 
district. 
Finally, the Moving Forward Act in-
cludes my amendment to authorize 
nearly $3.4 billion to construct, main-
tain, and renovate Department of Vet-
erans Affairs capital infrastructure. 
The amendment also prioritizes serv-
ice-disabled, veteran-owned small busi-
nesses to complete many of these 
projects. 
Ultimately, the Moving Forward Act 
puts our country on the path to a more 
sustainable future, and I urge the Sen-
ate to take it up immediately. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CHRIST CORDON 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember an outstanding 
member of the Panama City commu-
nity, Christ Cordon. 
Christ passed away last week. He was 
a devoted husband, father, and friend 
to me as well as many others. 
He owned a small business and quiet-
ly gave to organizations, individuals, 
and causes he believed in. He gener-
ously contributed to the Children’s Ad-
vocacy Center, checking on and sup-
porting them after Hurricane Michael. 
The fact that Christ gave so much 
without 
seeking 
any 
recognition 
speaks volumes about his character. 
His death is a truly huge loss for our 
community. He was exceptional. He 
leaves behind a loving wife and a young 
son. 
I am grateful for the time that I had 
with Christ Cordon and for the privi-
lege of calling him my friend. I encour-
age all of us to think about the impact 
we have made on our communities, and 
how we can continue to serve our com-
munities in the future, just as Christ 
did. 
f 
ADDRESSING INFRASTRUCTURE 
NEEDS IN OUR COUNTRY 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to have supported H.R. 2, the 
Moving Forward Act. 
This 
comprehensive 
infrastructure 
package will make clean energy invest-
ments, create more affordable housing, 
and improve broadband across the 
United States. 
I am proud that H.R. 2 included many 
of my bills, including the green bus tax 
credit, so that Monterey-Salinas Tran-
sit and Santa Cruz METRO, in my dis-
trict, can get their fleets of zero-emis-
sion buses on the roads and also my 
Clean Energy Production Parity Act to 
support linear generators manufac-
tured in California. 
H.R. 2 also includes my amendments 
to increase the Reforestation Trust 
Fund for more job-creating environ-
mental infrastructure and to give 
greater 
flexibility 
to 
communities 
using EDA funding so that we can bet-
ter target Federal funding for eco-
nomic recovery projects. 
It is past time to address the infra-
structure needs of our country. That is 
why I urge my colleagues in the Senate 
to, hopefully, take up and pass H.R. 2, 
so that we can continue to move our 
country forward to meet the challenges 
of tomorrow. 
f 
HONORING BRANDON CASERTA 
(Mr. MOULTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Brandon Caserta. 
Brandon was a 21-year-old United 
States Navy petty officer. He couldn’t 
get mental health help when he needed 
it, and as a result, he died from suicide 
on the flightline of his squadron in 
Norfolk, Virginia. 
Last week, on the second anniversary 
of the day that Brandon’s parents, Pat-
rick and Teri, lost their son, I was 
proud to introduce the Brandon Act. I 
am also proud to have successfully 
added this bill to the NDAA today in 
the House Armed Services Committee 
in honor of Brandon. 
With the Brandon Act, servicemem-
bers can seek mental health help when-
ever they need it, even outside the 
chain of command, which is important

in cases of hazing, bullying, or any-
thing else our heroes want to handle 
privately by self-referral. 
We won’t get Brandon back, but his 
legacy will be the servicemembers’ 
lives he saves when this bill becomes 
law. Let’s pass the Brandon Act for 
Brandon, Teri, and Patrick Caserta, 
and 
for 
every 
servicemember 
who 
wants mental health help but can’t get 
it. We owe it to them. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BUD COOK 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bud Cook, the 
northeast Pennsylvania program direc-
tor for the Nature Conservancy. 
For more than 40 years, Bud has been 
one of the foremost advocates for con-
servation and environmental protec-
tion in my community and in Pennsyl-
vania. 
For decades, Bud has led efforts to 
conserve and protect nature in the 
Greater Lehigh Valley and beyond. He 
established Monroe County Citizens for 
Open Space and led a pioneering fund-
raising campaign in support of land 
protection, and he has mentored gen-
erations of conservation advocates who 
have gone on to spearhead successful 
campaigns of their own. 
Bud’s quick wit and passion for his 
work have endeared him to many and 
helped create opportunities for collabo-
ration in communities that might oth-
erwise be divided, bringing together 
citizens united by their mutual desire 
to protect their beloved natural envi-
ronment. 
Bud’s legacy can be experienced in 
the Hauser Nature Center in Long 
Pond, in the Cherry Valley National 
Wildlife 
Refuge, 
and 
innumerable 
places across my community where 
natural beauty is protected and pre-
served in our time and for generations 
to come. 
As Bud prepares to retire and start a 
new chapter, I want to recognize his 
exceptional contributions. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grate-
ful community, we thank and con-
gratulate him for all he has done. 
f 
b 1745 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor to join you in the Chamber 
this evening. I thank all of our profes-
sional staff, as well; our parliamen-
tarian, our readers, our clerks, our typ-
ists for their continued commitment to 
this institution in this climate. 
It certainly feels different. We recog-
nize that the well is no longer open for 
this time period, that we speak from 
the desk and from the chairs, and yet, 
we still speak. We still deliberate. We 
still conduct the dialogue and the dis-
course of democracy, for that is what 
we do in this institution, we erect and 
pass the Nation’s laws. 
And oftentimes we hear from the 
public that it feels so polarized, that it 
feels too heated, that it feels stagnant 
because of the polarization. Why can’t 
you just work together? You hear that 
all the time. I hear that from my dis-
trict that is comprised of so many 
Independents, people who are not reg-
istered as Democrat or Republican. 
They are registered to vote, and they 
are good Americans in Michigan’s 11th 
district, but they are looking for us to 
work together. 
And in part, Madam Speaker, it is be-
cause I represent so many manufactur-
ers, so many individuals who are engi-
neers, who are dedicated makers and 
creators, so many educators, people 
passing those technical skills down to 
the next generation, Madam Speaker. I 
know you have many of those in your 
district in eastern Iowa. That is some-
thing us midwestern ladies have in 
common, the districts we represent are 
full of the people who make things. 
And they go to work every day not 
under a partisan circumstance, right, 
they go to work to produce, to give a 
good day’s effort for that on-time de-
livery. That is the privilege I have rep-
resenting the largest concentration of 
suppliers in America. 
The world changed very quickly in 
2020, this new decade in this still fledg-
ling century. It changed so quickly 
with the coronavirus pandemic. Almost 
overnight 
schools 
stopped, 
work 
stopped. Health and safety paramount. 
The listening and the engagement with 
the science, the patience that we had 
to provide for the science with a new 
virus that swept the globe in a fiscal 
quarter, less than a fiscal quarter. 
Many infected, many perished trag-
ically and unfortunately, and yet, our 
economy changed as a result. 
And I think it is worth noting where 
our economy is today and what I am 
seeing out of my incredible district, a 
manufacturing district. We have some 
sayings in Michigan, the metro Detroit 
area. We call ourselves ‘‘metro De-
troit.’’ It is southeastern Michigan. It 
is just an absolutely remarkable place. 
And we say, you know, Detroit hustles 
harder, that Detroit hustles harder. 
And I like to say that Detroit always 
rises, that we rise when times are 
steady, and we certainly rise when 
times are tough. And we have done it 
before, Madam Speaker. 
There is a fly in here, but I don’t 
mind having a little fly buzzing around 
the floor. Who’d a thunk? But the 
words continue. 
Detroit always rises. And we say that 
because 10 years ago we were staring at 
the edge of another cliff. Our auto in-
dustry was looking at bankruptcy, true 
liquidation, in the face. And it wasn’t 
just a nameplate company, it wasn’t 
just General Motors and Chrysler and 
Ford, but it was the thousands of sup-
pliers with the hundreds of thousands 
of jobs, 900,000 jobs on the line. 
And Democrats and Republicans to-
gether said, We are not going to let 
Main Street fail. We are going to con-
tinue to be a first world Nation with 
industrial assets. And that is what we 
did 
with 
the 
CARES 
Act. 
Over-
whelming support passed by a Repub-
lican Senate, a Democratic House, 
signed 
by 
a 
Republican 
President 
standing up for the hardworking Amer-
ican and for our industrial assets that 
we will continue to make cars in Amer-
ica. 
Little known fact about southeastern 
Michigan, we have an incredible aero-
space sector, a diversified supply chain. 
We just launched a rocket, SpaceX, 
into outer space. So many of the sup-
pliers in my region, so many of the in-
credible workers helped produce the 
parts and components that go into 
those rockets. It is absolutely remark-
able what we continue to do and the 
workforce that bests all the expecta-
tions. 
So what did we do when this pan-
demic hit and we had to say, Guess 
what? For the health and safety of ev-
eryone, auto manufacturing is ceased 
for the time being. It had to shelter, it 
had to hibernate. But then they stood 
up and said, We are going to make pro-
tective personal equipment. Ford with 
their respirators. General Motors with 
the ventilators. Chrysler with a mil-
lion-masks source and on and on down 
the supply chain. 
The hand sanitizer coming from 
Michigan Enterprises. It has been un-
believable having those conversations. 
AlphaUSA located right in Livonia, 
Michigan, right where our incredible 
district office is located. I saw them 
shortly before we went into the shut-
down, a UAW-run supplier company 
and they were making the PPE. Now, 
we keep our fingers on the pulse of this 
manufacturing sector. 
And we, by the way, recognize that 
today it is an incredibly special day, 
not only because it is America’s birth-
day coming up and we salute all of our 
good men and women, our veterans, 
our current members of our Armed 
Forces, and those who, throughout our 
communities, are going to safely en-
gage in recognizing America’s birth-
day. 
But we are also going to recognize 
what July 1st is, which is, it is the new 
day of our competitive framework as a 
North 
American 
continent. 
The 
USMCA. What the freshman class, with 
so many of us, came here to see done 
right, not for some, you know, bad ac-
tion for the prescription drugs or any-
thing along those lines, but to say, We 
are going to make things in America. 
We are going to increase Buy American 
content. We are going to make and 
produce and sell to the world, and by 
golly, we got this trade deal done. 
And so now we can go and win, and 
we 
can 
compete 
more 
effectively

against China. We know they are a 
problem. We know they are not good 
actors. We know they manipulate their 
currency. We know that they dump. 
But yet, it is a new dynamic here with 
this trade deal, and it begins today. 
And I am on the phone with the trade 
ambassador and the deputy trade am-
bassador and all our manufacturers 
working on an effective and fair imple-
mentation, recognizing that given this 
pandemic, given the low demand, that 
sales are down. It is on the front page 
of our Detroit newspapers today, the 
free press and the news, the projected 
almost-40-percent decline in auto sales. 
Remember 
my 
friends, 
Detroit 
hustles harder. Detroit always rises. 
We rise to the industrial call in this 
Nation. That is what we did in World 
War II. And we don’t say those things 
because they are cliches. We don’t 
hearken to the Greatest Generation be-
cause it is trite. It is because we can do 
big things in this Nation collectively 
and together. We can fight common en-
emies. We can protect the health and 
safety of everyone together. 
Look at what is manifesting in the 
neighborhoods around this country. 
Certainly, in the incredible neighbor-
hoods that I represent. Right across 
the street from me is an industrial 
park right off of Auburn Road. And 
then you go on down and there is a 
nursing home. Heroes work here. 
We value work in America. And there 
is no better time than this era that we 
have found ourselves in with the re-
spect and dignity for the value of work 
and organized labor and a 21st century 
labor movement that is going to pro-
tect enforceable standards and make 
sure that no one has to go to work 
afraid, but that they can successfully 
go to work and produce that outcome. 
Everyone matters. No one should be 
left behind. 
Our schools, the envy, frankly, in my 
opinion, in my district, the envy of the 
world because of our training pro-
grams. We have more first robotics 
teams in Michigan than in any other 
State in the country. 
Now, I was looking forward to going 
to Worlds, okay, it is located in Michi-
gan. It has teams from all over the 
world competing, not just because they 
are making amazing robotic machines 
and pieces of equipment, but they are 
doing strategy, they are doing commu-
nications, they are doing sales, they 
are doing diplomacy. These students 
give me hope, and we owe them all a 
debt, not just of gratitude but of re-
sponsibility. 
We talked a lot about the class of 
2020. We talked a lot about the class. 
They didn’t get to go through their tra-
ditional 
sayonaras, 
the 
traditional 
graduations, the proms, the engage-
ments. Some of them have senioritis to 
begin with. They are ready for that 
next step. They are ready for that 
training program, that engineering de-
gree. 
Oakland University, located in my 
district, an amazing engineering school 
leading in cybersecurity. We are a hub 
for cybersecurity in Michigan’s 11th 
District in partnership with Automa-
tion Alley. And yet we think about our 
students who are still coming through 
the pipeline who missed out on a sports 
season, who missed out on a computer 
science class, and yet they are not even 
seniors. And we have got to think very 
carefully and effectively and collec-
tively as a government, not just exclu-
sively as the House of Representatives 
as one Chamber, but in partnership 
with our government actors. 
This is why I talk to the dozens of 
mayors from Michigan’s 11th District 
every week. My friends, from Com-
merce, to Canton, to Plymouth, to 
Troy. We are on the phone with one an-
other working, deliberating, identi-
fying, and engaging. How do we get the 
best results possible for the most 
amount of people who we represent and 
work for in the given time? And that is 
what we are doing for our students. 
So I want to remind every student 
from the Chamber of which I am deliv-
ering this address, the House of Rep-
resentatives, we work for you and we 
will continue to be accountable to you 
and for you. We will listen to you, and 
we are so proud of you. 
For the recently graduated seniors 
who are going to go off to that fresh-
man year or to that new job or to join 
our military, we salute you. We are 
grateful for you. 
And for those of you still making 
your way through, we are not going to 
leave you behind, and we are going to 
continue to listen to you and see all 
the ways in which you use the tools be-
fore you to succeed. It is absolutely re-
markable. 
And we are going to continue with 
your intellect, your talent, your bril-
liance to be leaders in Michigan of the 
manufacturing economy. 
Where the world looks to us leading 
on electric vehicle technology, compa-
nies like soulbrain that make the 
chemicals, the electrolytes that go into 
the lithium-ion batteries. They are the 
only one in the region, and they are 
one of two in the United States. 
So we talk a lot about Buy Amer-
ican. Buy American. American jobs. Of 
course, we do. We are the country that 
makes things that the entire world 
wants to buy. And when we look at the 
complexity 
of 
supply 
chains 
and 
sourcing Buy American and who choos-
es to expand their business, we love 
when they come to Michigan. We do 
that because we have the right policies 
in place, and we have the right tap-
estry here. 
b 1800 
We are looking at our countless 
downtowns, small communities. I rep-
resent the suburbs, the downtown 
areas, the sole proprietors, the indi-
vidual companies that are not reliant 
on a brand name, but they are reliant 
on themselves. They are entrepreneurs. 
It is really quite remarkable the lead-
ership that they have shown. 
We are going to continue to listen to 
them and compete on fair and level 
playing fields. That is certainly a big 
part of it. 
We are going to recognize what a di-
verse workforce gets us, what the com-
petition for talent gives us, and we are 
certainly going to talk with our com-
munity stakeholders. 
We did so much in the CARES Act, 
Madam Speaker, to make sure that we 
stood up for the small businesses of 
America, the small businesses in our 
district. It is absolutely imperative to 
make sure that our small businesses 
can compete. 
Now that some of our companies are 
back online and we are seeing our auto 
manufacturing go back—I was just at a 
great company, Clips & Clamps, a tool 
and die company. They bought a brand- 
new stamping machine, just gleaming, 
absolutely beautiful. They turned on 
the stamper; I cheered. Just amazing, 
the humming of making things in this 
country. 
You have to understand the supply 
chain. You have to understand the 
complexity that goes into the payment 
cycles and the receivables and the need 
for fair and proper assurance. 
We only have to bat our eyes a couple 
of times and then we remember what 
we were looking at when we had the 
largest drop in automotive sales in re-
cent history. In 2008, credit dried up, 
and our suppliers were left wondering, 
‘‘Am I going to get paid? Am I going to 
continue to be able to do the on-time 
delivery?’’ We have to do that today, 
right? 
Liquidity in the supply chain is a 
real thing, and boy, is it complex to 
talk about. It certainly doesn’t fit into 
a nice hashtag or a 140-character sound 
bite. 
We wrote the Secretary of the Treas-
ury about this, Senator GARY PETERS 
and I, along with the Michigan delega-
tion. 
This is a great coming together of 
our government if we can get this done 
and make sure that our suppliers can 
continue to supply the original equip-
ment manufacturers. That is all they 
are asking for. That is all we are look-
ing for in that. 
I believe, with the right wherewithal 
in the Treasury, you can bring the 
banks together, you can listen to the 
workforce, you can make sure people 
still have jobs and that we continue to 
make things and compete as effectively 
as possible.

invite 
everyone 
to 
come 
over 
to 
Wixom, Michigan, home of the shut-
tered Ford Lincoln plant from 2007, a

There were people who were singing 
the swan song of my region not too 
long ago. We know what they were say-
ing. We stood up and said something 
different.

disability. It is something for all work-
ers. 
We talk about education and the 
need for equal funding in education. We 
talk about educating students of all 
abilities and jobs for people with all 
abilities. OPS Solutions was formed in 
the downturn in Ryznar’s basement, a 
furloughed auto engineer creating this 
incredible new enterprise. 
OPS Solutions just today joined the 
World Economic Forum, one of 50 com-
panies in the advanced manufacturing 
and technology space. 
The quiet humming that comes out 
of Michigan’s 11th District is the deter-
mination for where the world is going 
to go with how we make things, how we 
sell things, and how we operate in a 
digital economy. 
When we think about the plight of 
these last 20 years—I was talking to 
another small business owner in my 
district in the retail sector. ‘‘Oh, boy,’’ 
he was saying, ‘‘these last 20 years 
have really been a whopper. We had 
9/11. We had a recession. Now, we have 
a global pandemic. And every day, I am 
going into work, and I am working to 
sell, and I am working to connect with 
customers. And now, it is really dif-
ferent, connecting with customers.’’ 
You look at us as a Nation, and so 
many of these students today, these 
young adults, were just being born 
when our Twin Towers fell down and 
when our Pentagon was attacked. 
I was a young freshman myself at 
American University, dropped off for 
school, a kid from the Midwest who got 
a chance to study political science at 
an incredible school just a few miles 
from the Pentagon. My mom and my 
brother dropped me off, and they left. 
I had been talking to my mom about 
my 
new 
Government 
101 
political 
science course. I said, ‘‘Mom, I am so 
excited. This is such an amazing class. 
It is four credits, and that extra credit 
is experiential learning, and we get to 
go to the Pentagon.’’ That was the last 
conversation I had with my mom be-
fore 9/11/2001. 
She was calling my dorm room. She 
was calling my dorm room, and she was 
trying to get in touch with me. Every-
one was trying to get in touch with 
their 
loved 
ones, 
before 
the 
smartphone. She couldn’t get through. 
I signed on to AOL Instant Mes-
senger: ‘‘Hey, mom.’’ 
What happened next, as a Nation? It 
is a long story, but economically, we 
were the ones who proliferated the 
internet in Industry 4.0, as some people 
like to describe it, the industrial Inter-
net of Things, making faster, better, 
closer together, re-localizing manufac-
turing, re-shoring the production of 
things. 
I believe that device, those flat- 
screen devices, came from the great in-
novation of America. 
That is what we celebrate. That is 
what we work toward. That is the tap-
estry that we are working to put to-
gether in this Chamber. 
Come visit us at the House Science, 
Space, 
and 
Technology 
Committee 
under EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON’s fabu-
lous leadership, Chair EDDIE BERNICE 
JOHNSON, an incredible leader. 
Shortly before this pandemic was de-
clared, we passed a bipartisan energy 
and R&D package through the com-
mittee. JIM BAIRD and I, my ranking 
member, as I have the privilege of serv-
ing as the chair for the Research and 
Technology Subcommittee, passed the 
Building Blocks of STEM Act, invest-
ing in our next generation through the 
National Science Foundation. 
We can do these things with a return 
on the taxpayer dollar, by the way. We 
can have the conversation about effec-
tive and efficient spending. Just as this 
institution made money from the auto 
rescue, the taxpayer made money. 
I am optimistic about what is ahead. 
I am committed to what is ahead be-
cause of the stories and the people 
whom I have the privilege of working 
alongside in Michigan’s 11th District. 
I thank you, Madam Speaker, for 
your time and your diligence this 
evening, and all the people who con-
tinue to make our House of Represent-
atives hum. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
CENTENNIAL OF AMERICAN 
LEGION EARL GRAHAM POST 159 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FLORES) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 100-year anni-
versary of American Legion Earl Gra-
ham Post 159. 
American Legion Post 159 was char-
tered 13 February 1920 and named after 
First Lieutenant Cyrus Earl Graham, 
Texas A&M University class of 1916. 
Lieutenant Graham was a member of 
the United States Army Air Corps and 
was killed in action in France on 9 No-
vember 1918. 
From the beginning, The American 
Legion created an egalitarian organiza-
tion open to membership regardless of 
race, gender, or religion. Post 159 has 
embodied these goals and has been a 
community-minded organization since 
its inception 100 years ago. 
During this period, Post 159 has been 
dedicated to serving the local Brazos 
Valley community through events such 
as the Brazos County Fair and the his-
torical Juneteenth Celebration, both of 
which were hosted on The American 
Legion grounds. These events saw over 
1,000 people come together to embrace 
our community. 
Post 159 of The American Legion con-
tinues its commitment to the commu-
nity to this day, with programs that 
provide activities for local youth and 
veterans, as well as support for Active 
Duty military members serving over-
seas. 
The annual Resource Fair and Vet-
erans Assistance program provides over 
$20,000 in financial assistance to vet-
erans in need. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear that The 
American Legion Earl Graham Post 159 
has had a significant and positive im-
pact on the Brazos Valley during its 
100-year history. 
I have requested the United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to recognize this significant milestone 
and their contributions to our veterans 
and to our community. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our veterans, and for our military 
men and women who protect us and for 
our first responders who keep us safe at 
home. 
HONORING CLIFFORD SPIEGELMAN, PH.D. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Dr. Clifford Spiegelman of College Sta-
tion, Texas, who passed away on 14 
May 2020. 
Dr. Spiegelman, known as Cliff to his 
family and friends, was born on 15 May 
1948 in Long Island, New York, to Char-
lie and Doris Spiegelman. 
In school, he was recognized as an ac-
complished athlete and won numerous 
awards for track and other sports. He 
also excelled in the classroom and pur-
sued a career in academics, receiving 
his bachelor of science from the State 
University of New York at Buffalo in 
1970, his master’s degree in managerial 
economics from Northwestern Univer-
sity in 1973, and his Ph.D. in statistics 
and applied mathematics from North-
western University in 1976. 
Cliff started his career with the agen-
cy now known as the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology, 
commonly called NIST. He later be-
came a tenured professor at the De-
partment of Statistics at Texas A&M 
University. 
Serving on the faculty at Texas A&M 
for over 30 years, Cliff became re-
nowned in his field and a highly 
sought-after expert in the application 
of statistical expertise to forensic 
science, chemistry, and medicine. In 
2019, he was named a distinguished pro-
fessor of statistics, the university’s 
highest rank for faculty. His contribu-
tions to the field of statistics were fur-
ther recognized in his appointment as a 
regents professor in 2019. 
Cliff was particularly known for his 
helpful nature and deep commitment 
to justice and fairness in the criminal 
justice system. He was nationally rec-
ognized for his research on statistical 
interpretation of criminal evidence, 
such as bullet fragment analysis and 
firearm tool marks. 
He was a fierce advocate of accuracy 
by investigators to prevent false con-
victions. He further expanded his advo-
cacy through his work with the Inno-
cence Project, testifying pro bono in 
evidentiary admissibility hearings and 
providing research that played critical 
roles in overturning false convictions 
of innocent individuals. 
His commitment to justice extended 
outside of the courtroom as well. He

served on the Texas Forensic Science 
Commission as well as the Texas Holo-
caust and Genocide Commission, where 
he worked to ensure that the death sta-
tistics of the Holocaust and other geno-
cides are reliably reported. 
Dr. Spiegelman leaves a professional 
legacy that is unmatched in his field. 
However, 
his 
proudest 
accomplish-
ments were outside of the workplace. 
Cliff married Dr. Katherine Bretzlaff 
in 1990, a fellow professor at Texas 
A&M. Together, they raised two daugh-
ters, Lindsey and Abigail, who each 
carry their parents’ commitments to 
academic 
excellence, 
strong 
work 
ethic, and kindness to those around 
them. 
In the tributes written by the many 
individuals 
and 
organizations 
posi-
tively impacted by Cliff’s work, nearly 
all spoke of Cliff’s pride in his family 
and his frequent excitement to share 
the achievements of his daughters. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Dr. 
Clifford 
Spiegelman’s life was defined by his 
outstanding accomplishments as a pro-
fessor, mentor, and expert in statistics, 
as well as his commitment to his fam-
ily and friends. He will be forever re-
membered for his strong principles and 
commitment to excellence and as a de-
voted husband, father, and friend. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and 
heartfelt 
condolences 
to 
the 
Spiegelman family. I have requested 
the United States flag be flown over 
our Nation’s Capitol to honor the life, 
legacy, and service of Dr. Clifford 
Spiegelman.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LEWIS MERRIMAN 
BUTTERY 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. 
Lewis 
Merriman 
Buttery 
of 
Lampasas, Texas, who passed away on 
20 December 2008. Lewis Buttery was 
born on 20 March 1924 in San Angelo, 
Texas, to Albert James and Dorothy 
Hoss Buttery. 
On his 18th birthday, just 3 months 
after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he 
attempted to enlist in the United 
States Navy. He had hoped to join his 
older 
brothers 
in 
service—one, 
an 
Army artillery officer, and the other, a 
naval aviator. Unfortunately, Lewis 
was denied enlistment at that time due 
to health issues. 
This denial only strengthened his re-
solve to serve his country. Each month 
he attempted to enlist until he was fi-
nally accepted and sworn in on 20 Octo-
ber 1942. 
Lewis was called to Active Duty in 
June of 1943 and was sent to the Uni-
versity of Texas to continue pursuit of 
his engineering degree. He was later 
sent to Midshipmen School at Colum-
bia University in New York. In March 
1944, Lewis was commissioned as an en-
sign and ordered to San Francisco to 
complete gunnery school. 
He was ultimately assigned to USS 
Patrol Craft Escort 880 in Adak, Alas-
ka, as a gunnery officer. 
In preparation for the invasion of 
Japan, his ship was converted into a 
weather ship, and he became the aero-
logical, or weather, officer. The ship 
was transferred to the Marshall-Gilbert 
Islands area to transmit weather obser-
vations and to guide Army Air Corps 
bombers which were preparing the way 
for the invasion of Japan. The invasion 
did not occur due to the atomic bomb-
ing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, after 
which Japan quickly surrendered. 
Prior to being released to Inactive 
Duty in the Ready Reserve in July 1946, 
he became the executive officer of the 
ship and was promoted to lieutenant 
junior grade. 
Lewis was called back to Active Duty 
in June 1950 at the start of the Korean 
war, but his orders were ultimately 
canceled before he could reach his ship 
in San Diego. Ultimately, Lieutenant 
Buttery received an honorable dis-
charge in 1954. 
Following World War II, Mr. Buttery 
came home and finished his degree in 
chemical engineering at the University 
of Texas at Austin. He also married 
Virginia Kerzee in Limestone County, 
Texas, raised a family, and had a suc-
cessful career. 
Lewis was also a student of maps and 
cartography. Prior to the war in 1941, 
he completed courses in surveying and 
mapping at Texas A&M University and 
continued that avocation through the 
rest of his life. During his extensive 
work-related travels, Mr. Buttery col-
lected numerous atlases and maps, 
which he and his wife later donated to 
the University of Texas at Arlington’s 
Cartographic History Library. 
He was a founding member of the 
Texas Map Society and author of nu-
merous monograph and facsimile port-
folios devoted to early Texas. One of 
his works, entitled, ‘‘Regional Maps of 
Texas: 
1720–2001; 
Region 
1 
North 
Texas,’’ contains many valuable in-
sights about the mapping history of 
large portions of Texas. The maps that 
he and Virginia donated and the works 
that he published will continue to edu-
cate future generations interested in 
cartographic history. 
He was very proud of his time in the 
Navy and believed that it molded and 
shaped him throughout the remainder 
of his life. In recognition of this, the 
‘‘Navy Hymn’’ was solemnly played at 
his funeral. 
I have requested that a United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor the life, legacy, and service of 
Lewis Merriman Buttery. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country in 
these difficult times, for our military 
men and women who protect us, and 
the first responders who protect us at 
home. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL TY SPRADLIN 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Senior Airman Michael 
Ty Spradlin of Bryan, Texas, who 
passed way on 5 February 2020. Known 
as Ty to his family and friends, he was 
killed in a motorcycle accident at 
Yokota Air Force Base in Japan. 
Ty 
was 
born 
5 
March 
1991 
in 
Wheelock, Texas, to Theresa Lynn 
Spradlin and Michael Todd Spradlin. 
He graduated from Bryan High School 
in 2009 and enlisted in the United 
States Air Force in 2012. 
Over his 8 years of service in the 
United States Air Force, Ty worked as 
a crew chief on a variety of C–130 
planes. He traveled to many countries 
and enjoyed the opportunity to see the 
world. 
During his service, Ty traveled to the 
Philippines, Australia, Thailand, Ku-
wait, and Korea. He served at three dif-
ferent squadrons over those 8 years, in-
cluding: the 353rd Special Operations 
Group, Kadena Air Force Base in Oki-
nawa, Japan; the 755th Aircraft Main-
tenance Squadron at Davis-Monthan 
Air Force Base in Arizona; and the 
374th Maintenance Squadron, Yokota 
Air Force Base in Japan. 
Senior 
Airman 
Spradlin 
bravely 
served his country, and his legacy will 
be forever woven into our American 
military history. Ty was not only a 
proud public servant; he was a friend to 
all, a loving son, a brother, and an 
uncle. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and 
heartfelt 
condolences 
to 
the 
Spradlin family. 
I have requested the United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor the life, legacy, and service of 
Senior Airman Michael Ty Spradlin. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our veterans, for our military men 
and women, and for our first respond-
ers who protect us at home. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WAYNE PURSELLEY 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Wayne Purselley of Waco, Texas, who 
passed away on 29 February 2020. 
Wayne was born on 27 June 1932 in 
Loving, Texas, to Herman and Ida 
Purselley. He attended Texas A&M 
University and, upon graduation, was 
commissioned as a second lieutenant in 
the United States Air Force, ulti-
mately serving for 22 years. He flew 
6,000 hours as navigator and served as a 
missile launch officer before retiring as 
a lieutenant colonel. 
Following his retirement from the 
Air Force, Wayne became a teacher and 
planetarium director for Richfield High 
School in Waco, where he wrote and 
taught the ‘‘Christ Revealed in the 
Stars’’ lecture series for many years. 
Wayne was a dedicated member of 
Highland Baptist Church for 45 years, 
where he served in both leadership and 
teaching roles. In addition to his many 
roles within the church community, 
Wayne served as the president of the 
local Military Officers Association of 
America chapter, as well as the chair-
man of the McLennan County Repub-
lican Club. 
Wayne served our community and 
country for many years, and his legacy 
will be forever woven into our Amer-
ican history. 
Wayne was a committed and faithful 
husband to his wife, Barbara; a loving

HONORING THE LIFE OF COLONEL GLENN 
STARNES 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Colonel Glenn Starnes, who passed 
away on 30 March 2020. 
Glenn was born 27 January 1959 as 
the second son of Charles and LaVerne 
Starnes. He graduated from Texas 
A&M University in 1981 and was com-
missioned as an officer in the United 
States Marine Corps. 
Colonel Starnes led a life of service 
to both his country as a dedicated ma-
rine and to the Texas A&M community 
as a member of the Office of the Com-
mandant’s staff. 
Glenn served in the Marines for 30 
years and commanded at every level, 
from field artillery battery to field ar-
tillery regiment. While serving his 
country, he was stationed in seven 
States and two countries. He fought in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation 
Enduring Freedom through two tours 
of duty in 2003 and 2005. Glenn also 
served on joint duty with the U.S. Cen-
tral Command and later served as an 
exchange officer with the United King-
dom’s Joint Headquarters. 
Colonel Starnes was awarded the Le-
gion of Merit with two Gold Stars, the 
Bronze Star with Combat ‘‘V’’ Device, 
the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 
the Meritorious Service Medal with 
Gold Star, and the title of Officer of 
the Order of the British Empire from 
the Queen of England. 
After 30 years of service Glenn re-
tired from the Marine Corps in 2011. 
In 2012, Colonel Starnes joined the 
Texas A&M University community as 
assistant commandant for operations 
and training for A&M’s internationally 
recognized Corps of Cadets. 
In his 8 years on this job, Glenn was 
a tireless worker who loved the Corps 
and the opportunity to serve as mentor 
for many of its members. 
He was highly respected by his col-
leagues, and many Aggies feel fortu-
nate enough to call him friend. Colonel 
Starnes’ 30 years of dedicated service 
embody the core values of Texas 
Aggies: respect, excellence, leadership, 
loyalty, integrity, and selfless service. 
His loss will be deeply felt by the Texas 
A&M community and the Corps of Ca-
dets. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Colonel 
Starnes 
served his country proudly for many 
years, and his legacy will be forever 
woven into our American history. He 
was not only a dedicated public serv-
ant, he was a loving son, a husband, a 
father, an effective mentor, and a loyal 
friend to hundreds. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and 
heartfelt 
condolences 
to 
the 
Starnes family. 
I have requested the United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor the life, legacy, and service of 
Colonel Glenn Starnes. 
As I close today I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our veterans, for our military men 
and women who keep us safe, and for 
our first responders who keep us safe at 
home.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWIN H. COOPER 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Edwin H. Cooper of San 
Marcos, Texas. Edwin passed away on 
29 March 2020. 
Edwin was born 3 September 1930 to 
Margaret and Leslie Cooper. He grad-
uated from San Marcos High School in 
1949 and enrolled in Texas A&M Univer-
sity, where he was a proud member of 
the fighting Texas Aggie band. While

detailed his career at Texas A&M. 
Upon his retirement, Edwin and his 
wife, Peggy, moved to Camp Creek 
Lake in Robertson County, where he

As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue to pray for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
veterans, for our military men and 
women who protect us, and for our first 
responders who keep us safe at home. 
HONORING COLONEL DAVID MCINTYRE, PH.D. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Dr. David McIntyre of College Station, 
Texas, who passed away on 8 June 2020. 
Dr. McIntyre was born on 13 May 
1949, in Houston, Texas, to David and 
Mary McIntyre. From a young age, 
Dave felt a sense of duty and a call to 
selfless 
service 
which 
guided 
him 
throughout his life. He followed this 
call to the United States Military 
Academy at West Point where he was 
commissioned as armor officer in 1971. 
Following graduation from Airborne 
School and U.S. Army Ranger School, 
Dave was assigned as a scout platoon 
leader and jumpmaster in the 82nd Air-
borne Division at Fort Bragg in North 
Carolina. 
Over 30 years of dedicated service, 
Dave traveled all over the United 
States and to more than 45 foreign 
countries. He served with an armored 
cavalry reconnaissance unit at the 
Czechoslovakian border, flew to the 
base of Mt. Everest in a Russian Mi-17 
Hip helicopter, participated in the 
changing of the guard with the Gurkha 
Rifles at the Khyber Pass, and led a 
delegation to Angkor Wat. 
In addition to his many years of serv-
ice in the field, Dave placed great focus 
on academics and serving our country 
through education. He graduated with 
honors from the Command and General 
Staff College and earned his first mas-
ter’s degree from Auburn University. 
He then went on to serve as a professor 
of English literature at West Point 
while earning a Ph.D. from the Univer-
sity of Maryland. After 30 years of 
service, Dave retired as a colonel from 
his post as Dean of Faculty and Aca-
demics at the National War College in 
Washington, D.C. 
In June 2008 Dave was appointed to 
the National Security Education Board 
by President George W. Bush and con-
firmed by the Senate. He served on this 
board for 4 years until 2012. From 2010 
to 2014 he was a Distinguished Visiting 
Fellow at the Homeland Security Stud-
ies and Analysis Institute in Wash-
ington, D.C. His time in D.C. also in-
cluded providing congressional testi-
mony and national strategic docu-
ments for the Army Chief of Staff and 
serving on the National Board of Direc-
tors of the InfraGard National Mem-
bers Alliance. In addition to serving on 
many other boards and committees, he 
also served as a board member of the 
Homeland Security and Defense Edu-
cation Consortium. 
Following his retirement, David ac-
cepted a position as a professor at 
Texas A&M University through his role 
as founding director of the Texas A&M 
Bush School of Government and Public 
Service graduate Certificate in Home-
land Security program, his legacy of 
expertise in homeland security will 
live long through the knowledge and 
expertise in homeland security that he 
shared with his students. 
Also, while serving as a professor at 
Texas A&M, Dave continued to advise 
the U.S. Government on many projects 
and published a series of textbooks on 
homeland security. Dave also spoke at 
conferences and events as a premier 
subject matter expert of homeland se-
curity. 
Dave’s life was dedicated to his call 
to service, and through this journey he 
met his wife, Cathy. Together they 
raised two sons who share their fa-
ther’s spirit of service. He relished 
spending time with his family and 
seven grandchildren at home in College 
Station, Texas. 
I first met Colonel McIntyre when he 
and I ran for this congressional seat in 
2010. As I got to know him, I found him 
to be a fierce competitor, a policy ex-
pert, a committed public servant, a 
man of integrity, and an ultimate gen-
tleman. I can tell you firsthand that 
we will miss his contributions to Braz-
os Valley and to our Nation. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Dr. 
David 
McIntyre’s life was defined by his out-
standing accomplishments as Army of-
ficer, professor, an expert in homeland 
security, as well as his commitment to 
his family and friends. He will be for-
ever remembered as a true leader in his 
field, a devoted husband, father, and 
friend. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and heartfelt condolences to the McIn-
tyre family. I have requested that the 
United States flag be flown over our 
Nation’s Capitol to honor the life, leg-
acy, and service of Dr. David McIntyre. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
veterans, for our military men and 
women who protect us, and for our re-
sponders who keep us safe at home. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
POLICE REFORM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) is recog-
nized for the remainder of the hour as 
the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to talk about the very im-
portant topic of police reform and 
qualified immunity. 
Last week, I joined my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle in voting in 
favor of the Justice in Policing Act, a 
bill that the National Fraternal Order 
of Police said, ‘‘we believe, after good- 
faith discussions, will create a law that 
will have a positive impact on law en-
forcement and policing in our coun-
try.’’ 
My Republican colleagues who voted 
in favor of this bill did so because we 
must move the legislative process and 
negotiations forward so we can begin 
to repair the social contract again be-
tween our police officers around the 
nation and the communities that they 
serve. 
That being said, we believe that the 
qualified immunity provision in the 
bill, as it is currently drafted, must be 
fixed so that we can ensure that we 
protect our hero police officers both 
from physical harm and potentially 
frivolous lawsuits. 
Qualified immunity is a judicially 
created doctrine that grants govern-
ment officials who are performing dis-
cretionary functions immunity from 
civil suits unless the plaintiff shows 
that the official violated clearly estab-
lished 
statutory 
or 
constitutional 
rights that a reasonable person would 
have been aware of. 
Madam Speaker, to put it simply, 
qualified immunity states that if an of-
ficer acts in good faith and is doing 
what he or she believes is in line with 
their responsibilities of being a police 
officer, then they are protected from 
personal liability. 
While I believe that qualified immu-
nity is a very important doctrine, it 
should be reformed but not abolished. 
There must be reforms that address 
personal responsibility, accountability, 
and transparency in law enforcement, 
no doubt. However, the Justice in Po-
licing Act includes a provision on 
qualified 
immunity 
that 
must 
be 
amended 
in 
conference 
committee 
prior to final passage. I, for one, will be 
insisting on that prior to any bill being 
sent to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, as it currently 
stands, this provision would specify 
that a defendant is not immune from 
lawsuits just because they were acting 
in a way that they thought was reason-
able or lawful at the time or because 
they were not violating a clearly estab-
lished law. 
The overwhelming majority of our 
Nation’s police officers conduct them-
selves responsibly, appropriately, and 
within the confines of the law. Madam 
Speaker, I know this because I was one 
myself. We must reform qualified im-
munity to allow our police officers to 
act in a way they need to to perform 
their jobs while also removing protec-
tions that would shield those who ille-
gally deny citizens of the rights given 
to them by the United States Constitu-
tion. 
Having served as a lifelong Federal 
law enforcement agent and a Federal 
prosecutor, I will be playing an active 
role in bridging this gap and bringing

our law enforcement officials in our 
communities together, as will my Re-
publican colleagues who voted in favor, 
as we move to conference committee to 
merge the Senate and House proposals 
into one bill that works for everybody 
and protects our police officers. 
I will insist that the final package be 
written in a way that both protects 
citizens’ constitutional and civil rights 
and preserves the noble profession of 
law enforcement—the profession that I 
have dedicated the majority of my 
adult life to, the profession that my 
great-uncle Phil sacrificed his life and 
paid the ultimate price for having been 
killed in the line of duty as an NYPD 
police officer. 
Madam Speaker, this moment calls 
on all of us to come together and repair 
this social contract so that we as 
Americans can start to heal. I firmly 
believe that we are all capable of rising 
to this challenge because my own com-
munity in Bucks and Montgomery 
Counties in Pennsylvania has been a 
model when it comes to police-commu-
nity relations. 
We need to apply the community 
model of my amazing colleagues back 
home in law enforcement, always mak-
ing improvements based on self-reflec-
tion, 
listening, 
understanding, 
and 
learning, and show the rest of our Na-
tion and the world that we are a coun-
try of law and order, a country that re-
spects the rights, dignity, and equality 
of every single individual, and a coun-
try where police officers are one with 
the communities in which they serve, 
which is certainly the case back home. 
I am so proud of our law enforcement 
officers. We have a chance at real posi-
tive change, Madam Speaker. Let us 
not miss this moment. We can support 
our law enforcement officers and enact 
meaningful reform. I, for one, will be 
insisting on both before any final bill 
goes to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
AND STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise tonight to 
express my support for H.R. 2, the Mov-
ing Forward Act. 
I have supported this legislation be-
cause it is not only good for my con-
gressional district, it is also good for 
the country. 
This legislation will allow us to do 
something that I think is quite impor-
tant. I sit on the Financial Services 
Committee, and it allows us to address 
housing as a part of our Nation’s infra-
structure. 
The 
Honorable 
MAXINE 
WATERS has worked tirelessly to get 
housing included in this legislation. I 
believe it will benefit many people, es-
pecially those people who may find 
themselves with rent due and an inabil-
ity to pay their bills. 
I also am proud to say that it will 
help our ports. We have the Port of 
Houston, and that is a port that is very 
significant as it relates not only to 
Houston but to the country. 
It will help with our schools, and it 
will help with broadband. It is a very 
good piece of legislation. 
But there is one additional thing in 
this legislation that I think would be 
of benefit, not only to the young people 
in this country but also to our police 
officers. This is H. Res. 169 which is a 
piece of legislation that emanated in 
my office. This would have a driver and 
an officer safety education component. 
We talk about the conversations that 
African American parents have with 
their children. This is a conversation 
that takes place because of a history 
that we too well understand. This leg-
islation addresses that conversation, 
but it addresses it not only as it relates 
to the young person, the person who is 
going to be driving the car, it also ad-
dresses it as it relates to the officer. 
It would grant States moneys for 
grants such that they would be able to 
train officers about the interactions 
with civilians and train civilians, give 
them the education that they need so 
that they will understand how to prop-
erly interact with officers. 
Understanding can change the course 
of history. It can make a difference in 
the lives of people. My hope is that 
with this legislation in H.R. 2 it will 
cause somebody to benefit from just 
knowing how to interact with a person 
who happens to be a police officer or a 
police officer getting a better under-
standing of how to interact with some-
one from a given community. 
As important as this piece of legisla-
tion is, I do understand that if we are 
to have the kind of change that we 
seek, we will probably have to have an-
other piece of legislation that I am 
proud to offer. This is a piece of legis-
lation calling for a department of rec-
onciliation. A lot of what is happening 
in our country is systemic. It is insti-
tutionalized. If we want to deal with 
systemic and institutionalized prob-
lems, especially as they relate to race, 
then we need to have a department so 
that we can approach these systemic 
issues not only in the short term but 
over the years and over the decades. 
This department of reconciliation 
will, of course, have a secretary of rec-
onciliation. This secretary will have 
the responsibility of devising the strat-
egy and implementing a strategy to 
eliminate racism and invidious dis-
crimination in our country. 
b 1845 
This department will be properly 
funded. We would like to see it funded 
with a minimum of 10 percent of what 
the Department of Justice receives. 
This would be the equivalent—the 
money would not come from the De-
partment of Justice—but the equiva-
lent of 10 percent of what the Depart-
ment of Justice receives as a minimum 
in funding. 
This department would be one that 
would give us the opportunity to look 
into the future and devise a means by 
which we can avoid some of the sys-
temic problems that we currently have. 
Madam Speaker, my hope is that this 
resolution will get the support of my 
colleagues. It has gained support every 
day, and I look forward to getting the 
continued support of my colleagues for 
the 
resolution. 
The 
resolution, 
of 
course, is the forerunner to a bill, a bill 
that will actually develop this depart-
ment of reconciliation. 
We found that there is a Labor De-
partment, and this Labor Department, 
of course, deals with issues associated 
with labor. We have other departments 
that are specialties. They specialize in 
dealing with certain issues. Well, why 
not a department of reconciliation so 
that we can do something that has long 
been needed since the Emancipation 
Proclamation? 
While we had the invidious discrimi-
nation known as segregation, through 
the years, we have not done what we 
need to do, and that is reconcile, settle 
our differences, come to a conclusion 
as to what is appropriate when it 
comes to some of the icons that we 
have in this country with reference to 
Civil War memorabilia and where it 
can be placed. These kinds of things 
can be resolved through the depart-
ment of reconciliation. 
Madam Speaker, my hope is that we 
will have the department available to 
us in the near future. My hope is that 
this is something that Presidential 
candidates will embrace and want to 
talk about. I will surely put it before 
candidates when given the opportunity 
because the secretary will report di-
rectly to the President of the United 
States. This will give us the insight 
that we need into the Office of the 
Presidency. And the President can, of 
course, provide legislation by and 
through the secretary. 
It is a good piece of legislation, and 
my hope is that we will get it passed. 
Finally, this: I am honored to say 
that I, too, support law enforcement. 
My uncle was a deputy sheriff. He had 
a great amount of influence on my life. 
I believe that I am in Congress today 
because of some things that he said and 
urged me to do. 
Madam Speaker, I support law en-
forcement. I don’t paint all law en-
forcement 
officers 
with 
the 
same 
brush, just as I don’t want all pro-
testers to be painted with the same 
brush. 
I support the right to peacefully pro-
test. I believe that if we who support 
the protest movements and support 
peace officers, if we would actually let 
people know that there are some per-
sons who are in the police forces that 
are not acceptable because of their be-
havior, and there are some people who 
are associating themselves with the 
protest movement who are not accept-
able because of their behavior—persons 
who do things that are inappropriate, 
persons who would burn buildings, this

is inappropriate. I don’t support that. 
Officers who would put their knees on 
the necks of persons, that is inappro-
priate. No one would support that, I 
would hope. 
Madam Speaker, I just think that, as 
we move forward, let’s not conclude 
that there is something wrong with the 
protest movement because of some of 
the people who associate themselves 
with the movement, just as I don’t con-
clude that there is something wrong 
with all police officers because of the 
actions and behavior of some police of-
ficers. There are people within both of 
these entities that I speak of who are 
good, and the bad ones, we, of course, 
should eliminate. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, Judge AL 
GREEN. He is a brother, and I appre-
ciate him very much. We have dif-
ferences of opinion, but I know we are 
going to end up the same place to-
gether. 
Madam Speaker, there is so much 
that has been going on that has been 
disrupting the country, and I am not 
sure what all my good friend, a former 
judge in Houston, was saying. I didn’t 
get to hear that. But I believe he was 
addressing some of the unrest. 
He and I both want to see freedom. 
We want to see equality. We want to 
see people treated fairly and equally. 
Those are things we share, and I know 
that is what is on his heart. 
But I am highly concerned about the 
legitimate peaceful protests that were 
taking place as a result of the cruel 
death, the killing of George Floyd. And 
his family, and the way they ap-
proached it, was inspirational. There 
deserve to be protests over that horren-
dous death. 
The Floyd family pointed out they 
did not want the legacy of George 
Floyd to be violence and suffering and 
death and looting. That was not, and is 
not, what they want for the memory 
and legacy of George Floyd. 
But the movement has been hijacked. 
The violence they don’t want, just the 
justice they want. It has been hijacked. 
And it is very important that Ameri-
cans understand what is going on here, 
so that it is not just those who have 
spent our lifetimes studying history 
that see so clearly what is going on by 
instigators who want to see the coun-
try that has been in an ongoing state of 
getting better and better—for years, 
even with unfairness and inequality, it 
has still been the hope of the world 
when it comes to freedom and a shot at 
equality. 
Antifa, 
short 
for 
antifascist—and 
there has been no greater irony in the 
world that Hitler and Stalin—two mad 
men, evil men with a globalist desire— 
ended up against each other. Of course, 
it is quite ironic that when they got to-
gether and signed a treaty, both of 
them, behind the scenes, were talking 
about the day when that individual 
would breach the treaty with the 
other. 
One of the things Stalin was so furi-
ous about when Hitler moved east was 
that Hitler broke the treaty before 
Stalin had the chance to. They were 
two evil people, and they were pushing 
an evil idea: with Hitler, the evil of fas-
cism; with Stalin, the evil of Marxism, 
communism, socialism, whatever you 
want to call it. It is all about the same 
thing. 
So, you have communism and fas-
cism. Both of them want globalism. 
They want to control the world, and 
they don’t want anybody else to con-
trol it. They want to control it. 
The treachery and the evil that went 
under both of those leaders is leg-
endary. Hitler killed over 6 million 
Jews in some of the most horrific and 
evil ways conceivable. Stalin did the 
same thing, except he killed many mil-
lions more. 
Then in China, decades after that 
came Mao, who brought communism to 
China. It is hard to get your arms 
around a proper number. We know Sta-
lin killed around 20 million Ukrain-
ians, starving them to death, but he 
killed no telling how many millions 
more. You just look at the evil treat-
ment of the poor Polish people that 
when he liberated them, he took so 
many who were what he saw as good 
slave labor and brought them back in 
slavery to the Soviet Union, where 
they either worked as slaves under Sta-
lin or they were killed. 
When the Iron Curtain fell, just as 
many historians, including a brilliant 
historian I eagerly learned under at 
Texas A&M—she was not allowed back 
in the Soviet Union after she wrote 
about the evil that was done to so 
many of the Polish officers and people. 
One of my favorite history teachers, 
she was terrific, brilliant. But when 
the Iron Curtain fell, we found out the 
things that she said and discovered, 
and others did, were exactly right. 
Reagan was right. It was an evil em-
pire. And the one Hitler was trying to 
build was just about as evil—in some 
ways, much more evil. 
But it is important that young peo-
ple and millennials understand what 
we are talking about here. This coun-
try, warts and all, has been, as movie-
maker Ron Maxwell said, ‘‘a history of 
liberation.’’ It wasn’t founded on slav-
ery. It was on the march toward libera-
tion, each step. 
So many Christians, like the Pil-
grims and so many others, came to 
avoid persecution for being Christians. 
Sometimes, people came who were con-
sidered unwanted in other countries. 
If you look at the original draft of 
the 
Declaration 
of 
Independence, 
Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves, 
had entered what probably was the big-
gest paragraph setting out a grievance 
against King George. It is spelled out 
in this grievance against King George, 
that he ever allowed slavery to get 
going in the Colonies, because it was so 
terrible. It was evil, and it took too 
long and cost too many lives to get rid 
of it. 
By the way, that grievance didn’t end 
up in the final draft because there were 
States that objected, that supported 
slavery. So that grievance Jefferson 
had originally put in was taken out. It 
was not in the final draft. 
b 1900 
But it took a war that took half a 
million lives in a country that didn’t 
have half a million lives to spare, dev-
astated the United States. 
Lincoln believed the Union should be 
held together, and it would be held to-
gether, and this would be the capital of 
the whole country. 
And he wanted no malice to anyone 
at the end of the war. He wanted to 
bring the country together. But it took 
an ordained Christian minister named 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and so 
many 
others, 
including 
some 
who 
served in Congress, it took them stand-
ing for equality and what is right to 
ensure that the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and the Constitution would 
mean what it said. 
In some ways, in recent years, we 
have been distracted by people who 
have been at war, on offense against 
Christianity, so that now we are to the 
point where, if you believe what Jesus 
said, as set out in the New Testament, 
then you, among so many millions now 
in our country, are to be an object of 
scorn and hate. 
So, as you see these groups that are 
really Marxist groups—antifascist does 
not mean it is a good group; it means 
it is Marxist. And that is where they 
want to take us, and it means Christi-
anity will be persecuted to the extent 
we have seen, with the horrors we have 
seen over the centuries since Jesus was 
here. 
So there is an article by Igor 
Norinsky, June 28, in American Great-
ness, talking about Black Lives Mat-
ter. 
I really don’t believe at all that there 
is a single member of Congress who 
doesn’t agree Black lives matter. I 
don’t know anybody who is in Congress 
who does not believe that Black lives 
matter. 
This article starts out saying: ‘‘To 
the 60 percent of Americans not polling 
for Trump, many firmly left-of-center, 
a thought experiment as November 
draws nearer: What must be true so 
that Trump gets your vote? It is a mis-
erable question because many Ameri-
cans are, to put it mildly, negative on 
the President.’’ 
The article goes on—don’t have time 
to go through the whole thing. But the 
point is made here: ‘‘The emotional 
call-and-response appeal of ‘black lives 
matter’ ’’—and that is with little B, lit-
tle L, little M—‘‘entices all who repeat

it into believing they are antiracists 
and that everyone else must be the op-
posite. But ‘black lives matter’—with 
small letters—which no one disagrees 
with, is not the same as’’—capital-
ized—‘‘Black Lives Matter.’’ 
They had what they believed at one 
time—that has since been taken down, 
as I understand it—and substituted for 
one that is a little more palatable, but 
make no mistake: You look at the his-
tory of this group, it is a Marxist 
group. 
The 
article 
points 
out: 
‘‘Com-
munism,’’ which is simply ‘‘Marxism 
applied, was responsible for over 100 
million deaths during the last century 
alone, which says nothing of the psy-
chological terror, the Auschwitz of the 
mind, that imprisoned the untold mil-
lions who did not perish. The system-
atic oppression and terror Marxist 
ideas engendered is nowhere better de-
scribed than Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s 
‘Gulag Archipelago,’ a painstaking and 
harrowing account of the forced labor 
camp 
system 
under 
Soviet 
Com-
munism. In a telling passage, he pro-
vides an insight into the engine that 
made the tyranny possible.’’ 
And he quotes from Solzhenitsyn: 
‘‘Macbeth’s self-justifications were 
feeble—and his conscience devoured 
him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb, 
too. The imagination and spiritual 
strength of Shakespeare’s evildoers 
stopped short at a dozen corpses. Be-
cause they had no ideology. Ideology— 
that is what gives evildoing its long- 
sought justification and gives the evil-
doer the necessary steadfastness and 
determination. That is the social the-
ory which helps to make his acts seem 
good instead of bad in his own or oth-
er’s eyes. . . . That was how the agents 
of the Inquisition fortified their wills 
. . . the colonizers, by civilization; the 
Nazis, by race. . . . Without evildoers, 
there would have been no Archi-
pelago.’’ 
The writer says: ‘‘I was spared those 
horrors thanks, in part, to being born 
near the dismal end of the Soviet 
Union and thanks, in part, to the cour-
age of parents who dared seek permis-
sion to leave from a central authority 
notoriously brutal to the unbelievers. 
As Jews ostensibly bound for Israel, we 
had the great fortune of being un-
wanted anyway. Almost all of your 
life’s possessions stay behind—they be-
long to ‘the people,’ after all—but the 
scars most certainly do not. Scars 
travel with you. The many hundreds of 
thousands of refugees and exiles from 
Communist countries living in Amer-
ica today can fill entire libraries with 
the stories behind those scars. Go seek 
them out and listen. 
‘‘Whether in Stalin’s Russia, Mao’s 
China, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, the pre-
cepts of Marxism led humanity as close 
to the abyss as it has ever come.’’ 
‘‘Neither do Marxism’s purveyors and 
apologists all sit in Beijing. For years, 
many intellectuals in the West openly 
espoused Marxism. Its great utopian 
appeal should come as no surprise par-
ticularly in our present age of social 
justice. Solzhenitsyn would later la-
ment at the West’s failure to accept 
the grim warnings of his testimonial.’’ 
And, 
again, 
from 
Solzhenitsyn: 
‘‘Modern society is hypnotized by so-
cialism. It is prevented by socialism 
from seeing the mortal danger it is in. 
And one of the greatest of all is that 
you have lost all sense of danger; you 
cannot even see where it’s coming from 
as it moves swiftly toward you. 
‘‘You imagine you see danger in 
other parts of the globe and hurl ar-
rows from your depleted quiver there. 
But the greatest danger of all is that 
you have lost the will to defend your-
selves.’’ 
Hate Donald Trump if you want. So 
far, for now, we have that freedom. But 
the fact is, he saw the dangers from 
China before anybody in public office 
did and talked about them. 
But anyway, Solzhenitsyn wrote that 
‘‘in 1976 as the United States was deep 
into the Cold War. Nearly 45 years 
later, long after the Cold War has 
ended, the generation that is driving 
today’s revolutionary agenda has little 
to no conception of what socialism is 
and what brand of misery it left in its 
wake. It is nearly impossible to cul-
tivate any sense of dread or urgency in 
a society where connection to that 
chapter of the human experience has 
all but been severed. But we have to 
try.’’ 
And he is so right. 
‘‘BLM,’’ he says, ‘‘is pure ideology. It 
appears bent on redefining America 
and its institutions pursuant to pro-
gressively tribalistic commandments. 
Draped in the powerful, albeit decep-
tive, cover of racial indignation’’— 
which we should all stand for equality 
there—‘‘the movement has convinced 
many Americans that being White is 
an original sin, that America is evil, 
and that the sinner’s day in court has 
arrived. It prescribes class struggle, ex-
ponentially amplified by the battle cry 
of racial reckoning.’’ 
‘‘Revolutions vilify the past.’’ 
And he goes on. 
But it is important that people un-
derstand that, as we try and move clos-
er and closer to end any injustice in 
America—it will never be perfect, but 
it is the closest humanity has ever got-
ten, and still there are things we can 
do to make it better—it is critical to 
understand the evil that is so close to 
taking over and embracing this coun-
try, because we have generations now 
that have not learned true history. 
They have learned some misbegotten 
professor’s idea, as he or she dealt with 
their own hate and own prejudice, as 
they rewrote our history. 
But if you look fairly at the history, 
you see injustice, none more so than 
slavery’s existence. 
But if you go back to the late 1940s, 
early 1950s, when Whittaker Chambers, 
who had had a very unpleasant child-
hood, unpleasant family life growing 
up, thought maybe communism, Marx-
ism was the way to go, and he began 
working with people like Alger Hiss, 
who was one of the most respected peo-
ple in the State Department, right at 
the top. And because he had an Ivy 
League education, Ivy Leaguers loved 
the man, just thought he was fantastic. 
But 
both 
Alger 
Hiss, 
Whittaker 
Chambers, and others with whom they 
worked and believed in communism, 
were working to bring down the United 
States, just as antifa and so many oth-
ers are today. 
When Whittaker Chambers began to 
see that this Marxism that he thought 
so much of actually caused more suf-
fering than the very type of govern-
ment he was trying to bring down, that 
was revolutionary in his mind, and he 
realized he was fighting the wrong peo-
ple. 
His book ‘‘Witness’’—I should have 
read it years and years ago, but it is 
only in the last couple of years I read 
it. Some great statements he has in his 
book. 
‘‘Few men are so dull that they do 
not know that the crisis exists and 
that it threatens their lives at every 
point. It is popular,’’ he said, ‘‘to call it 
a social crisis. It is, in fact, a total cri-
sis—religious, moral, intellectual, so-
cial, political, economic. It is popular 
to call it a crisis of the Western world. 
It is in fact a crisis of the whole world. 
Communism . . . is itself a symptom 
and an irritant of that crisis.’’ 
He quoted Stalin’s statement: ‘‘Is it 
not true that social democracy and so-
cial fascism are twins? ’’ 
Our current chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee has gotten very upset 
when some of us have pointed out that 
Hitler and Hitler’s party were the Na-
tional Socialist Workers Party in Ger-
many. And he tried to draw that dis-
tinction, but Stalin himself says: Isn’t 
it true that social democracy and so-
cial fascism are really twins? 
But Dostoevsky, he quoted, saying: 
‘‘The problem of communism is not 
economic problem; the problem of com-
munism is the problem of atheism.’’ 
I have seen it, lived it for a summer 
in the Soviet Union. They didn’t want 
Christianity. They only allowed one 
authorized seminary. I was told, when I 
visited there, that they allowed only 40 
people to go to the only authorized 
seminary back during those oppressive 
years under communism. 
Whittaker Chambers says: ‘‘One day 
the Communist really hears those 
screams. The screams . . . do not mere-
ly reach his mind. They pierce beyond. 
They pierce to his soul.’’ 
‘‘A communist breaks because he 
must choose at last between irreconcil-
able opposites—God or man, soul or 
mind, freedom or communism.’’ 
b 1915 
This Marxist ideology that is being 
pushed on us by groups that hate 
America is very dangerous. Chambers 
points out ‘‘ . . . the crisis of the West-
ern world exists to the degree it is in-
different to God. It exists to the degree 
in which the Western world actually

shares communism’s materialist vi-
sion, is so dazzled by the logic of the 
materialist interpretation of history, 
of politics, and economics, that it fails 
to grasp that, for it, the only possible 
answer to the communist or Marxist 
challenge is to choose either faith in 
God or faith in man. . . . ‘’ 
He said: ‘‘Freedom is a need of the 
soul and nothing else. It is in striving 
toward God that the soul strives con-
tinually after a condition of freedom.’’ 
I think every American has felt that. 
He says: ‘‘God alone is the insider 
and guarantor of freedom. He is the 
only guarantor. External freedom is 
only an aspect of interior freedom. Po-
litical freedom, as the Western world 
has known it, is only a political read-
ing of the Bible. Religion and freedom 
are indivisible. Without freedom, the 
soul dies. Without the soul, there is no 
justification for freedom.’’ 
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin made this 
comment on religion in a November 
1913 letter: ‘‘Every religious idea of 
God, even flirting with the idea of God, 
is unutterable vileness . . . of the most 
dangerous kind.’’ 
I think that is why, on visiting that 
sole recognized seminary at Zagorsk 
decades ago, I was struck because there 
was a building there, and on the side of 
the building—this is where you turn 
into the gates of the seminary—was a 
big painting of Lenin’s face and the 
words: ‘‘Lenin s nami.’’ ‘‘Lenin is with 
us.’’ 
So anyone going into this Christian 
seminary had to see, as they went in, 
that message from the government. 
You may be going into this Christian 
seminary, but don’t ever forget it is 
Lenin who is with us. 
Now, I had a chance to see Lenin in 
his tomb. There were rumors that his 
ear was deteriorated and had been re-
placed by a rubber ear. I don’t know if 
that was true, but Lenin was not with 
us, I can verify. He is long gone to his 
just reward, such as it was. 
Whittaker Chambers said: ‘‘If I had 
rejected only communism, I would 
have rejected only one political expres-
sion of the modern mind, the most log-
ical because the most brutal in enforc-
ing the myth of man’s material per-
fectibility. What I sensed, without 
being able to phrase it was what has 
since been phrased with the simplicity 
of an axiom.’’ 
This axiom is: ‘‘’Man cannot organize 
for himself without God; without God, 
man can only organize the world 
against man.’ The gas ovens of Buchen-
wald and the communist execution cel-
lars exist first within the minds.’’ 
He said: ‘‘What I grasped was that re-
ligion begins at the point where reason 
and knowledge are powerless and for-
ever fail—the point at which man 
senses the mystery of his good and evil, 
his suffering, and his destiny as a soul 
in search of God.’’ 
‘‘Against liberalism’s social opti-
mism,’’ which is progress by reform, 
‘‘and 
the 
social 
optimism 
revolu-
tionary left,’’ which is progress by 
force, ‘‘Dostoevsky asserted the eternal 
necessity of the soul to be itself. But 
he discerned that the moment man in-
dulged his freedom to the point where 
he was also free from God, it led him 
into tragedy, evil, and often the exact 
opposite of what had been intended. In 
human terms, there was no solution for 
the problem of evil.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

S4083 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 2020 
No. 121 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Mighty God, You are the strength of 
our lives, our safe fortress, and our 
shelter from life’s storms. During this 
season of a raging tempest, speak Your 
peace to our Senators. Remind them 
that You continue to rule Your uni-
verse through the unfolding of Your 
prevailing providence, and that Your 
truth continues to march on in our Na-
tion and world. 
Lord, prosper the works of the hands 
of our legislators as they strive to glo-
rify You with their thoughts, words, 
and actions. 
May faith replace fear, truth defeat 
falsehood, justice triumph over greed, 
and love prevail over hate. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RUSSIA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, if 
reports are true that Russia has been 
paying a bounty to the Taliban to kill 
American soldiers, this is a very seri-
ous escalation of what Russia expert 
Edward Lucas dubbed ‘‘The New Cold 
War.’’ Mr. Lucas said that back in 2008. 
This sort of movement by Russia, if 
it is proven—and there are a lot who 
believe with Russia it is possible—it 
demands a strong response. And I don’t 
mean a diplomatic response. 
We have had previous things like this 
happen with Russia. President Bush 
tried playing nice with Russia, then 
talking tough when Putin showed his 
true nature. 
President 
Obama 
repeated 
this 
cycle—you know the word—‘‘resetting’’ 
relations, despite Russia having just 
occupied parts of our ally Georgia, and 
then switching gears when Russia in-
vaded Ukraine. 
Putin is a KGB guy who understands 
only 
strength. 
His 
popularity 
has 
taken a hit lately. It makes him very 
unpredictable. That may be why he is 
doing these things, even though Russia 
has a reputation for doing them all the 
time. 
So we need to increase deterrence on 
NATO’s eastern flank. We should also 
hit back where it hurts. 
Dictators like Putin fear their own 
people—and, of course, for good reason. 
Putin and his cronies have enriched 
themselves at the expense of ordinary 
Russians. 
This week Russia is having a ref-
erendum on waiving term limits, al-
lowing Putin to stay in power when his 
term is up. Of course, Russia will prob-
ably be conducting a rigged election. 
We should point out to the Russian 
people that they don’t have to accept 
that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I had planned to speak first today 
about the NDAA. I had planned to dis-
cuss our work to ensure American serv-
icemembers can protect our Nation and 
secure peace for the United States. 
Unfortunately, the inexplicable pas-
sivity and weakness of local leaders in 
our own country has denied some citi-
zens peace and security right here at 
home. 
Here we are in Congress, equipping 
our Armed Forces to protect the home-
land. Yet some local leaders have ap-
parently felt it would be too politically 
incorrect to do their jobs and keep the 
peace. 
It has now been 22 days since radical 
demonstrators seized control of several 
blocks of downtown Seattle, drove the 
police out of a precinct, and declared 
an autonomous zone, which the mob 
itself would rule. 
It is worth pausing to consider how 
the mainstream media and leading 
Democrats might have reacted if tea 
party protesters in 2009 had forcibly 
created a breakaway zone within a 
major city and barred the actual au-
thorities from entering. Somehow I am 
skeptical the press would have bent 
over backward to find a sympathetic 
light. Somehow I doubt these same 
politicians would have felt compelled 
to curry favor with the occupiers or 
flirt with their demands. 
But we are talking about the Amer-
ican left in 2020. So, instead, what we 
get is a major newspaper lavishing 
praise—praise—on 
the 
‘‘liberated 
streets’’ and a mayor and local govern-
ment that have expressly declined to 
restore order and the equal protection 
of the law. 
The mob has gotten its way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4084 
July 1, 2020 
There have been numerous shootings 
in this lawless place. About a week 
ago, a 19-year-old was shot and killed. 
Last weekend, after yet another shoot-
ing, a 16-year-old is dead and a 14-year- 
old was injured. Some reports suggest 
these two boys were shot by a self-ap-
pointed security squad. These are mis-
cellaneous citizens who roam the area 
with guns drawn after the occupiers 
drove the real police out. 
We are talking about Seattle, WA, in 
the United States of America? 
The rule of law cannot fade in and 
out with the fashions of the radical 
left. No leaders should have sacrificed 
small businesses to riots and mobs a 
few weeks back, and no leader should 
let threats or leftwing jargon persuade 
them to tolerate occupations for weeks 
on end. 
I understand that, just this morning, 
Seattle’s 
mayor 
finally—finally—re-
leased a new order that at last empow-
ered police to bring an end to this. So 
let’s hope the rule of law finally—fi-
nally—prevails. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on an entirely different matter, the 
Senate has indeed turned to what will 
be the 60th annual National Defense 
Authorization Act. If you look at the 
world news, it would appear we have 
done so not a moment too soon. 
After months of threats, President Xi 
and the Chinese Communist Party fi-
nally delivered the punch in the mouth 
to the city of Hong Kong that they are 
calling a ‘‘national security law.’’ As I 
and others have warned for months, it 
tramples all over the freedoms and au-
tonomy that have set Hong Kong apart. 
Today marks the 23rd anniversary of 
Hong Kong’s handover from the United 
Kingdom. Normally this anniversary 
would have occasioned peaceful dem-
onstration. Instead, the new law has 
brought scores of arrests and boasts 
from local authorities about how many 
peaceful 
demonstrators 
they 
have 
jailed, 
new 
harsh 
penalties 
for 
Hongkongers for new and vague of-
fenses, and new authority from Beijing 
to intervene at will. 
It appears to directly—directly—vio-
late China’s international promises and 
effectively end the ‘‘one country, two 
systems’’ policy. 
I have discussed at some length the 
specific consequences China will face 
for this. I will continue to discuss them 
in the future. 
This same week, we received new 
confirmation 
that 
China’s 
ethnic 
cleansing campaign against the Uighur 
people in Xinjiang includes forced 
abortions, forced birth control, and 
State-enforced sterilizations on a sys-
tematic scale. 
All of this is in addition to the inter-
national provocation that China has 
only stepped up during this pandemic— 
which 
they 
helped 
worsen—against 
Taiwan, against India, against the 
Philippines, and so on. 
China is not our only adversary occu-
pying the spotlight. Recent days have 
intensified questions about Russia’s 
negative role in the Middle East. 
I have long warned that Russia and 
other adversaries will exploit any 
American passivity or retreat from 
this important region. Whether in 
Syria or Afghanistan, the question is 
whether we will stand our ground and 
exert our influence or allow Iran, Rus-
sia, and terrorists to literally push us 
out of the region. 
Sadly, as the Senate turns to the 
NDAA, the need to continue making 
swift progress on our national defense 
strategy is staring us plain in the face. 
Fortunately, Chairman INHOFE, Rank-
ing Member REED, and our colleagues 
on the Armed Services Committee have 
put forward a bill that rises to the 
challenge. 
The bill establishes the Pacific De-
terrence Initiative. It lays out a clear 
vision for making our Pacific joint 
force more adaptable and our commit-
ments to regional partners more fea-
sible, smarter basing for forward-de-
ployed Americans, more supplies and 
equipment prepositioned. 
It will encourage more streamlined 
technology so that, from weapons plat-
forms to information security, America 
and its allies in China’s backyard stand 
ready to counter aggression together. 
This NDAA authorizes full funding 
for the European Deterrence Initiative, 
doubling down on our NATO alliances 
as we check the worst impulses of 
Putin’s Russia. The bill will further 
limit the information Putin gets per-
taining to missile defense, bring more 
focus on tracking Russian support for 
terrorist proxies and despotic regimes, 
and renew our commitment to have 
U.S. forces support, train, and keep 
watch alongside our partners. 
But it isn’t enough to check our ad-
versaries today. We also need to outrun 
them toward the future. So this legis-
lation will also support critical re-
serves to help us secure a decisive edge 
in everything from hypersonic weapons 
to 5G communications. 
Threats to our Nation are pulling 
American servicemembers in all direc-
tions. Fortunately, this NDAA has all 
of their backs. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on one final matter, while the Senate 
maintains the serious approach that 
builds bipartisan successes like the 
CARES Act and the Great American 
Outdoors Act, the House Democrats ap-
pear addicted to pointless political the-
ater. 
Well, our absentee neighbors have fi-
nally arrived back in the Capitol, and 
they have wasted no time resuming old 
tricks. The Speaker has chosen to 
spend the House’s time this week on a 
multithousand-page 
cousin 
of 
the 
Green New Deal masquerading as a 
highway bill. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it; the chair of the House Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
said so. He said: ‘‘This is the applica-
tion of the principles of the Green New 
Deal.’’ And he is right, because here 
are the four pillars of the Green New 
Deal: No. 1, spend an insane amount of 
money; No. 2, check every far-left ideo-
logical box; No. 3, propose bad policies; 
and No. 4, forget about making law 
from the very beginning so you can leg-
islate in a world of pure fantasy—pure 
fantasy. Check, check, check, and 
check. 
This 
so-called 
infrastructure 
bill 
would siphon billions in funding from 
actual infrastructure to funnel into cli-
mate change policy. By putting a huge 
thumb on the scale for mass transit 
and electric vehicles, it revises the old 
Obama-Biden focus on disproportion-
ately helping major metro areas, leav-
ing less for the rest of our country. No 
wonder it came out of committee in 
the House on a purely bipartisan vote. 
No wonder the White House declared it 
not a serious proposal and made it 
clear this will never become law. 
Naturally, this nonsense is not going 
anywhere in the Senate. It will just 
join the list of absurd House proposals 
that were only drawn up to show fealty 
to the radical left. Here in the Senate, 
we will keep at the serious work of our 
Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4085 
July 1, 2020 
AMERICAN WORKFORCE RESCUE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this morning, I have come to the floor 
with Senators WYDEN and BENNET to 
talk about a really bold new idea to ex-
tend enhanced unemployment assist-
ance for as long as economic conditions 
in the country warrant it. I will speak 
about that legislation more in a mo-
ment, but first, two other issues. 
S. 4049 
Madam President, first, last night 
President Trump threatened to veto 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act—the bill on the floor this week— 
because it contains a provision to re-
name military bases named after Con-
federate generals. 
Let me make a prediction. First, that 
provision will not change in this bill as 
it moves through the House and Sen-
ate. Second, let me predict that Presi-
dent Trump will not veto a bill that 
contains pay raises for our troops and 
crucial support for our military. This 
is nothing but typical bluster from 
President Trump. The NDAA will pass, 
and we will scrub from our military 
bases the names of men who fought for 
the Confederacy and took up arms 
against our country. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on a second mat-
ter, before I get to the main topic of 
this morning, all week, Democrats 
have been trying to force action on the 
Senate floor to make progress on cru-
cial issues related to the COVID–19 
pandemic. As Senate Republicans con-
tinue to mindlessly delay the next 
round of COVID–19 relief, we have tried 
day after day to jolt the Senate into 
action. Last night, we made notable 
progress. 
In the late hours of last evening, we 
were able to pass a monthlong exten-
sion of the Payment Protection Pro-
gram, whose loan authority expired at 
midnight with over $130 billion left in 
the program. We had to force our Re-
publican colleagues to act on this very 
simple and noncontroversial exten-
sion—a date change—to help small 
businesses across America, particularly 
underserved 
businesses, 
minority- 
owned businesses that had trouble ac-
cessing the PPP program in its early 
days. 
Throughout the day, we heard, to our 
surprise, that our Republican friends 
might block the legislation, but when 
the time came, Senator CARDIN’s con-
sent request was agreed to. It certainly 
is something to celebrate, but I would 
have hoped that our two parties could 
have worked this out before last night 
as a small part of much broader legisla-
tion to address the many challenges 
posed by COVID–19 rather than a con-
sent request forcing the Republicans to 
act. 
But Senate Republicans, unfortu-
nately, seem dead-set on delaying al-
most any action on COVID–19 until 
after July, after they have had time, in 
the words of Leader MCCONNELL, ‘‘to 
assess the conditions in the country.’’ 
The obstruction is deeply regrettable 
and 
impossible—impossible—to 
ex-
plain. 
We have other deadlines before us, 
not just the PPP. Today is July 1. With 
the first of the month comes a new 
rent payment for millions of American 
families who have lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own. Senate 
Democrats, led by Ranking Member 
SHERROD BROWN, are going to ask the 
Senate to pass rental assistance and an 
extension on the moratorium on evic-
tions. Will Senate Republicans agree to 
our request or leave millions of renters 
out in the cold? 
I 
would 
say 
to 
my 
Republican 
friends, let the extension of the PPP 
program be a metaphor. Democrats are 
going to keep pressing for Senate ac-
tion on COVID–19-related issues. Let 
the Republican response be quick and 
generous, not stingy and halting. Sen-
ate Republicans are going to have to 
respond one way or the other and ei-
ther support urgent and necessary 
pieces of legislation or explain to their 
constituents why they are blocking 
them. It would be far better to pass 
these measures earlier rather than 
later and be more generous rather than 
stingy.

WYDEN and Mr. BENNET pertaining to 
the introduction of S. 4143 are printed

on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolu-
tions.’’)

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 6 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this morning on an 
issue that is topical. It is an issue that, 
over the last several days, has become 
a national centerpiece of conversation. 
It reflects a decision of just a few 
days ago by the Supreme Court that re-
jected President Trump’s efforts to re-
peal 
deportation 
protections 
for 
Dreamers—young 
immigrants 
who 
came to the United States as children. 
In an opinion by Chief Justice John 
Roberts, the Court held that the Presi-
dent’s decision to rescind DACA, the 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 
Program, was ‘‘arbitrary and capri-
cious.’’ 
It was 10 years ago that I joined with 
Republican Senator Dick Lugar, of In-
diana, on a bipartisan basis, to call on 
President Obama and beg him to use 
his legal authority to protect Dreamers 
from deportation. President Obama re-
sponded by creating the Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals Program, 
known 
as 
DACA. 
It 
provided 
for 
Dreamers temporary protection from 
deportation—2 years at a time—if they 
registered with the government, paid 
substantial fees, and passed criminal 
and 
national 
security 
background 
checks. More than 800,000 Dreamers 
came forward and received DACA pro-
tection. 
DACA unleashed the full potential of 
these Dreamers, who are contributing 
to our Nation in a variety of ways—as 
soldiers, as teachers, as nurses, as 
small business owners. More 
than 
200,000 DACA recipients are currently 
‘‘essential critical infrastructure work-
ers.’’ That is not my term. It is the 
way President Trump’s Department of 
Homeland Security describes the work 
of these DACA recipients now—200,000 
of them ‘‘essential critical infrastruc-
ture workers.’’ Among those DACA re-
cipients, 41,700 of them are in the 
healthcare industry. This includes doc-
tors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, 
and respiratory therapists. They are 
the healthcare heroes we salute, and at 
the same time, they are the DACA re-
cipients this President loathes. 
On 
September 
5, 
2017, 
President 
Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds of 
thousands of Dreamers faced losing 
their work permits and faced being de-
ported to countries many of them bare-
ly remembered, if they remembered at 
all. Thankfully, the Supreme Court 
stepped in and rejected that strategy 
by President Trump. 
What was the President’s reaction? 
To no surprise, the President re-
sponded by attacking the Court and 
threatening to try to repeal DACA, 
even again, in the closing months of 
his first term. 
Congress must step in immediately. 
After that Supreme Court decision, 
President Trump tweeted, ‘‘I have 
wanted to take care of DACA recipi-
ents better than the Do Nothing Demo-
crats, but for two years they refused to 
negotiate.’’ 
Here is the reality. The President has 
rejected numerous bipartisan proposals 
to deal with DACA and the Dreamers. 
May I be specific? 
On February 15, 2018, the Senate con-
sidered bipartisan legislation that was 
offered by Republican Senator MIKE 
ROUNDS
and 
Independent 
Senator 
ANGUS
KING—a bipartisan measure. 
The bill, which included a path to citi-
zenship for Dreamers, was supported by 
a bipartisan majority of the Senate. 
Why did it fail to reach 60 votes? Be-
cause President Trump openly opposed 
it. That is why. He said: I have a better 
idea. 
On the same day that the Senate 
voted on the President’s immigration 
proposal, we found his so-called ‘‘better 
idea’’ failed by a bipartisan super-
majority of 39 to 60. 
On June 4, 2019, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed H.R. 6—on June 4, 
2019, which was more than a year ago. 
H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act, is 
legislation that would give Dreamers a 
path to citizenship, and it passed the 
House with a strong bipartisan vote. 
The Dream and Promise Act has been 
pending in the Senate for more than a 
year. I have come to the floor, day 
after day, and heard the Republican 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, bemoan-
ing the fact that we are so busy here in 
the Senate and that the House just 
isn’t doing its work. Yet the House has 
sent some 400 pieces of legislation to 
Senator MCCONNELL’s desk—90 percent 
of it bipartisan. He refuses to consider 
it. He refuses to bring it to this empty

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4086 
July 1, 2020 
Senate floor so that we can do our 
work. One of those measures, sadly, is 
the Dream and Promise Act—the bill 
that would solve at least part of the 
immigration challenge we now face in 
America. Last week, I sent a letter, 
signed by all 47 Democratic Senators, 
calling on Senator MCCONNELL to im-
mediately schedule a vote after the Su-
preme Court decision. As of today, the 
Senator has not replied. 
Over the years, I have decided that 
the only way to tell the story of the 
Dreamers and the story of DACA is to 
introduce them here in the Senate. I 
have asked them to come forward, if 
they wish, provide me with photo-
graphs, and let me tell their stories. 
This is the 124th story I am going to 
tell. It is the story of a remarkable 
young woman named Cinthya Ramirez. 
Cinthya Ramirez came to the United 
States from Mexico at the age of 4. She 
grew up in Nashville, TN. She wrote me 
a letter. Here is what she wrote about 
growing up: 
Moving to the United States gave me the 
gift of education. I learned English by the 
first grade, and that is when I learned that I 
loved school and I loved learning. 
While in high school, Cinthya was on 
the track team and was a student 
council representative and a great stu-
dent. She graduated at the top of her 
high school class with the highest hon-
ors. Cinthya went to Lipscomb Univer-
sity, which is a private Christian col-
lege in Nashville, and she graduated 
with a nursing degree. Today, thanks 
to DACA, Cinthya works as a cardiac 
registered nurse at Vanderbilt Univer-
sity Medical Center—the largest hos-
pital in Nashville, TN. Cinthya is on 
the frontline of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Here is what she writes about this ex-
perience: 
I am a very spiritual person, and I pray a 
lot. I remind myself that this is the job that 
I was meant to have. If the time comes for 
patients to die and they cannot have their 
families with them, we have to be there for 
them. 
Cinthya’s greatest fear is that of 
bringing the coronavirus home to her 
family when she comes home after her 
nursing shifts at the hospital. 
Here is what she writes: 
I take every precaution before entering the 
house. I take off my clothes, clean my phone, 
go straight to the shower. The rest is in the 
hands of God. 
I thank Cinthya Ramirez—a DACA 
recipient—for her service. She is an im-
migrant healthcare hero. She is a 
DACA healthcare hero. She is putting 
herself and her family at risk to save 
the lives of others. She should also not 
have to wake up every morning in fear 
that actions taken by the Trump ad-
ministration will lead to her being de-
ported back to a country she can bare-
ly, if at all, remember. 
This is a classic example of this de-
bate and what it is about—and to think 
that, in a year, we have not even taken 
up this issue that was sent to us by the 
House while it winds its way through 
our judicial process all the way to the 
highest Court in the land, where the 
ruling was in favor of Cinthya and the 
DACA recipients who have this protec-
tion. 
In that year, did we step forward in 
the U.S. Senate—the so-called greatest 
deliberative body on Earth—to even de-
bate the bill that passed the House of 
Representatives? No. No, there was no 
time for that. As you can see, we are so 
busy here on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
There is so much more that we could 
do here. Shouldn’t we start with the 
highest priority—protecting Americans 
in the midst of this pandemic? 
This woman, Cinthya Ramirez—un-
documented, protected by DACA—risks 
her life every single day because of this 
pandemic. Can we risk ourselves politi-
cally for a minute in the Senate and 
actually take up a measure that could 
have a direct impact on the lives of the 
800,000 DACA recipients and the thou-
sands of others who could have applied 
for that protection during the months 
that we have debated this in court? 
Sadly, we have been unable to do 
that, and it is all because of a decision 
being made by the President of the 
United States and by the Republican 
majority leader, and it is a decision 
which needs to be addressed directly. 
In a few moments, I am going to offer 
a unanimous consent request, when it 
comes to moving this bill, that was 
sent over by the House of Representa-
tives more than a year ago. I am really 
going to call the bluff of this President, 
who asks: Why doesn’t Congress act? 
Why don’t you come up with a bipar-
tisan proposal? 
Mr. President, here is our chance. 
Here is an opportunity. 
We have a bill that has been sitting 
here for a year that would address 
Cinthya Ramirez’s future and the fu-
ture of thousands of others. The ques-
tion is whether or not the Members on 
the other side of the aisle, on the Re-
publican side of the aisle, will at least 
let us address this issue now. 
Give us an opportunity to bring be-
fore the U.S. Senate a measure which 
is no surprise, nothing revolutionary or 
new. It is a measure we have consid-
ered in various forms over the last 20 
years, but it is a measure that would 
address this issue and do it in a 
thoughtful way. 
This is an opportunity which we 
should seize. Wouldn’t it be remark-
able, maybe a headliner, if the Senate 
actually did something—if we actually 
took an issue of the day that affected 
real people, real lives, in the middle of 
this coronavirus epidemic and actually 
decided that this young woman and 
thousands like her were worth the ef-
fort? 
I think America would be shocked 
that this U.S. Senate responded that 
way, and don’t tell me we have better 
things to do. I am all for doing the 
military authorization bill. We can get 
that done and be back in 2 weeks and 
take this up immediately. We know the 
bill is here. We know that the bill is 
prepared and covers the areas that 
would protect this young lady and so 
many others and give them a future in 
the United States of America. At this 
point, it is really up to us. 
Now, there may be an objection when 
I make this unanimous consent re-
quest. Listen carefully to the objec-
tion. It has nothing to do with resolv-
ing the issue before us—the issue of the 
future of this young woman and thou-
sands of others just like her. 
But we are in a position at this mo-
ment where we have to act. I am await-
ing the arrival of a Republican Mem-
ber, who I hope is on the way, and so at 
this point I am going to suspend and 
yield the floor with the hopes that we 
can return to another colleague coming 
to the floor momentarily. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
am here to urge my colleagues on the 
Republican side not to object—follow 
last night’s example and allow this 
simple, humane, and good-for-our-econ-
omy amendment to go forward. 
First, I want to salute Senator DUR-
BIN. There has been no voice—no voice 
of any elected official whom I know 
who has had a stronger, longer, and 
more passionate defense of the DACA 
kids, many of whom are now adults. 
And he has pricked the conscience of 
the Nation so that now the DACA kids 
and their families are, really, by most 
Americans respected and by many 
Americans just loved. I am one of those 
in the latter category. I love these kids 
and their families. 
I 
have 
watched 
them, 
on 
the 
frontlines during the coronavirus crisis 
in New York, risk their lives, even 
though they are not allowed to be full 
Americans, to help. 
Now we have an opportunity here to 
simply say: Stop harassing them. Let 
them do their jobs. Let them live their 
lives. Let them be with their families 
here in America so they can help us in 
our economy recover from COVID, as 
they have been doing, without looking 
over their shoulder and worrying about 
being deported or having one of their 
family members being deported every 5 
minutes. 
It is such an important amendment. 
It is so good for the country. The idea 
that immigrants are bad for America, 
that DACA kids are bad for America, is 
a regressive, nativist, and often bigoted 
idea that some use for political pur-
poses, but nothing, nothing, nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
So I urge my colleagues not to object 
to Senator DURBIN’s fine amendment to 
help America live up to its ideals and

its dreams. That lady in the harbor in 
the city in which I live—‘‘Give me your 
poor, your tired, your huddled masses 
yearning to breathe free’’—that has 
been part of the American fabric for 
centuries. 
This is a chance to bring us back to 
that fabric, that wonderful fabric that 
has been so good for our country for 
those centuries. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague and friend 
Senator SCHUMER. We have been fight-
ing this battle for a long time, Senator. 
Eight of us who came, four Demo-
crats and four Republicans, put to-
gether a comprehensive immigration 
reform bill which should have passed 7 
years ago—68 votes on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. It was a bipartisan meas-
ure, which we joined with Senator 
McCain to put together to bring to the 
floor. 
I thank you for your heartfelt com-
ments. 
I am going to speak a little longer 
and make a unanimous consent re-
quest. 
This measure I am asking for unani-
mous consent on, the American Dream 
and Promise Act, was introduced by 
Representative 
LUCILLE
ROYBAL- 
ALLARD, Democrat of California, on 
March 12, 2019, with 202 original co-
sponsors. 
It would provide Dreamers, tem-
porary protected status recipients, and 
individuals with deferred enforcement 
departure with protection from depor-
tation and an opportunity to obtain 
permanent legal status in the United 
States if they meet certain require-
ments. 
It passed the House of Representa-
tives 237 to 187—7 Republicans joined 
the 230 Democrats who were present to 
support the legislation. 
Protections in the American Dream 
and Promise Act would allow nearly 
700,000 DACA recipients, as well as an-
other 1.6 million eligible Dreamers 
brought to the United States as chil-
dren to stay in our country legally. 
The bill’s protections would also 
allow over 300,000 temporary protected 
status holders and 3,600 individuals 
that I described earlier with the same 
opportunity. 
It would create a conditional perma-
nent resident status valid for up to 10 
years that would protect Dreamers, in-
cluding DACA, from deportation and 
allow them to work legally in the 
United States. Cinthya Ramirez could 
continue working as a nurse long after 
this pandemic is gone. 
To qualify for this, the Dreamers 
would need to meet requirements. They 
must have come to the United States 
before the age of 18—she came at the 
age of 4—and continuously lived here 
for at least 4 years. 
They must demonstrate they have 
been admitted to an institution of 
higher education, earned a high school 
diploma or equivalent, or are currently 
in the process of doing that. She is a 
graduate of Lipscomb University with 
a degree in nursing. 
They must pass government and 
background security checks, submit bi-
ometric and biographic data, dem-
onstrate good character with no felo-
nies, misdemeanor offenses of domestic 
violence, or multiple misdemeanor con-
victions, and they must register for the 
Selective Service, if applicable—she 
has already met all these standards by 
the examination she has been put 
through for DACA—and, of course, pay 
their application fee. 
DACA recipients and other DACA-eli-
gible Dreamers who still meet the re-
quirements needed to obtain DACA 
would automatically qualify for condi-
tional permanent resident status. 
When the President ended DACA in 
September of 2017, we stopped accept-
ing applications from those who were 
eligible. Now these young people would 
have the chance, if they meet the re-
quirements and the test that is re-
quired of them. 
They must complete one of three 
tracks: graduate from college or uni-
versity or complete at least 2 years of 
a bachelor’s or higher degree program 
in the United States; complete at least 
2 years of honorable military service or 
have worked for a period totaling at 
least 3 years while having valid em-
ployment authorization; maintain con-
tinuous residence in the country; dem-
onstrate an ability to read, write, 
speak English; understand American 
history, principles, and form of govern-
ment. 
It is a high standard, but it is one 
they are prepared to meet and they 
should meet to become part of Amer-
ica’s future. 
How important are they? Well, they 
are extremely important in every sin-
gle State. We know that there are some 
780,000 DACA recipients across the 
United States. There are 109,000 of 
them in the State of Texas—109,000. 
The average age of arrival for them is 
7. They came here as kids. Their an-
nual tax contributions are in the mil-
lions. I could read the numbers. 
In the State of Texas, there are 30,000 
of these DACA recipients who have 
been characterized by the Trump ad-
ministration as essential workers— 
30,000—4,300 DACA healthcare workers 
in the State of Texas. 
The States of Texas, Arizona, Cali-
fornia, Florida, and others are going 
through a resurgence of infection and 
death from this pandemic. These DACA 
young people—many of them are on the 
frontline 
fighting 
this 
disease, 
as 
Cinthya Rameriz is in Tennessee. 
The notion that we want them to 
leave now—4,300 leave Texas now— 
healthcare workers? Unimaginable. It 
makes no sense. 
It is time for us to do something. At 
a minimum, for goodness’ sake, in this 
empty Chamber, can we come together 
and debate this issue? 
The President has challenged us to 
do it. Let’s do it—not be afraid of it. 
Put it through an amendment process 
on the floor. I have lived through that 
before. It actually would resemble the 
U.S. Senate, which many people re-
member from the history books, where 
people actually came to deliberate and 
vote on amendments. That is all we are 
asking for. Bring this under unanimous 
consent to the floor. Let’s do it. The 
President has challenged us. 
I am going to make a unanimous con-
sent request. I see the Senator from 
Texas is on the floor here, and I want 
to make sure I get the right copy. Here 
it is. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 112, H.R. 6, the American Dream 
and Promise Act; further, that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed; that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
You know, someone watching this at 
home might think that Senate Demo-
crats want to actually enact amnesty 
for the so-called DACA recipients. Of 
course, they could have done so earlier. 
President 
Trump 
offered 
Senate 
Democrats a deal that would have 
granted permanent amnesty for all the 
DACA recipients, and the Democrats 
turned it down. They didn’t want the 
deal. They hoped, instead, to have an 
issue in November. 
You know, we are right now in a time 
of crisis in our country. We have a 
global pandemic, and we have 44 mil-
lion Americans out of work. This is, on 
the economic side, the greatest crisis 
our country has seen since the Great 
Depression. 
Yet what we are seeing in the Senate 
is a continuation of something we have 
seen for several years, which is that to-
day’s Democratic Party doesn’t value 
working men and women—American 
working men and women. 
Last week, we saw a decision from 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States on amnesty. It was a particu-
larly 
disgraceful 
opinion. 
Unfortu-
nately, it was authored by Chief Jus-
tice Roberts; it was joined by the four 
liberals; and it concerned President 
Obama’s illegal amnesty. 
DACA, when it was issued, was ille-
gal. Actually, for years, President 
Obama admitted that. When activists 
asked him: Will you decree amnesty 
unilaterally, as an executive, he told 
them over and over again: I can’t do 
that. I am bound by Federal immigra-
tion laws. I am not a King. I am not an 
Emperor. 
That 
is 
what 
President 
Obama said repeatedly. 
But then as the election approached, 
I guess they reassessed and decided 
that being a King or Emperor sounded 
pretty good, and so DACA, the day it 
was issued, was directly contrary to 
law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4088 
July 1, 2020 
Federal immigration law says in the 
statute books that if you are here ille-
gally, it is illegal for you to stay, to 
get work permits, and the Obama ad-
ministration ignored Federal immigra-
tion law and simply printed what were 
called work authorizations. 
My friend from Illinois has a picture 
of a lovely young lady whom he has 
spoken about. 
What he doesn’t have a picture of is 
what happened after Executive am-
nesty was granted for those who came 
illegally as kids, which is that the 
number 
of 
unaccompanied 
children 
skyrocketed. 
In the State of Texas I have been 
down to the border many, many times. 
I have visited with the Border Patrol 
many, many times. You know, when 
you go online, you see cages with chil-
dren in them. What many of the people 
online don’t tell you is that it was the 
Barack Obama administration that 
built those cages, and it was Executive 
amnesty that resulted in tens of thou-
sands of little boys and little girls 
being sent alone with violent drug traf-
fickers, with coyotes. Far too many of 
those kids were physically assaulted 
and sexually assaulted. You are not 
helping children by incentivizing little 
boys and little girls being in the hands 
of violent traffickers. That is not hu-
mane. I have seen child after child 
after child abused by this system, and 
every time the Democrats offer more 
amnesty, the predictable result is that 
more children are going to be phys-
ically and sexually assaulted. Amnesty 
is wrong. 
It is also the wrong priority of to-
day’s Democratic Party. Their priority 
is on people here illegally and not on 
American workers, not on keeping 
American workers safe. 
What we should be doing—and in just 
a moment, I am going to ask unani-
mous consent for this body to take up 
and pass Kate’s Law. I am the author 
of Kate’s Law in the Senate. Kate’s 
Law is named for Kate Steinle, a beau-
tiful young woman in California who 
was murdered on a California pier by 
an illegal immigrant who had come 
into this country illegally over and 
over and over again. He had multiple 
violent criminal convictions over and 
over and over again, but our revolving- 
door system kept letting him out. 
As Kate Steinle died on that Cali-
fornia pier, her father held his daugh-
ter in his arms, and her last words were 
‘‘Daddy, please help me.’’ 
I have had the opportunity to visit 
with Kate Steinle’s family. What hap-
pened to her was wrong. It shouldn’t 
happen, and the reason it happens is 
that our broken system keeps letting 
go violent criminal illegal aliens. What 
does Kate’s Law provide? Common-
sense legislation that says aggravated 
felons—people with serious felony con-
victions—who 
repeatedly 
enter 
the 
country illegally face a mandatory 
minimum prison sentence; in other 
words, we are not going to let them out 
and allow them out to commit mur-
ders, rapes, and assaults. We are not 
going to let them out to abuse and 
threaten children. 
Kate’s Law is overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan common sense. If you go into the 
great State of Illinois and ask the vot-
ers of Illinois ‘‘Does Kate’s Law make 
sense?’’ overwhelmingly, they say yes. 
That is true in every State in the coun-
try. 
By the way, it is true of voters who 
aren’t just Republicans. It is true of 
Democrats, and it is true of Independ-
ents. It is true of everyone except the 
47 elected Democrats in this Chamber 
and their colleagues in the House of 
Representatives because the reason 
Kate’s Law is not the law is that every 
time I have tried to bring it up, the 
Democrats have objected to it. 
If Kate’s Law had been on the books, 
Kate Steinle would still be alive be-
cause the violent criminal who kept 
coming in over and over and over again 
illegally would have been in jail in-
stead of murdering that young woman. 
Amnesty is wrong. Illegal Executive 
amnesty is wrong, and we need to have 
as our first priority protecting the 
American workers and keeping the 
American people safe. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
my understanding that the Senator 
from Texas was going to offer a con-
sent request. 
Mr. CRUZ. Yes. 
Mr. DURBIN. I think this is the mo-
ment to do it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—KATE’S LAW 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Kate’s Law, which is at the 
desk. 
I ask unanimous consent that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, lis-
ten carefully to what we just heard 
from the Senator from Texas. First he 
talked about amnesty. Amnesty as I 
understand it is a blanket forgiveness 
for the commission of a crime. 
Cinthya 
Ramirez 
has 
DACA—the 
DACA protection that I described—2 
years at a time. She was brought here 
to the United States from Mexico at 
the age of 4. She has paid her fee, has 
gone through her background check, 
and receives 2-year protections to con-
tinue in this country. According to the 
Senator from Texas, that is amnesty 
for a crime—amnesty for a criminal. It 
is certainly not that. 
This young woman has been as open 
with our government as she could pos-
sibly be, and for it she has received 2 
years at a time to build a life, and 
what a life she has built. Undocu-
mented and uncertain of her future, a 
person who is doomed by the Trump 
administration’s policy finishes her 
medical education in nursing school at 
Lipscomb University, a Christian col-
lege in Nashville, and works at one of 
the best hospitals in the whole region, 
saving the lives of people who are fac-
ing COVID–19, and in the eyes of the 
Senator from Texas, she is just another 
criminal looking for amnesty. Really? 
I am sorry, that doesn’t add up. It 
doesn’t add up at all. 
To say today that because we are 
seeking help on DACA, Democrats do 
not value American workers—another 
statement made by the Senator from 
Texas—may I remind the Senator that 
all of the people we are talking about 
in the DACA Program are currently in 
the United States legally working be-
cause of DACA? It is not as if they are 
taking jobs away by coming into this 
country and displacing others. Many of 
them are unemployed because of the 
economy too. She is doing work people 
are afraid to do, exposing herself to the 
coronavirus every single day. 
You heard the routine she goes 
through when she comes home from 
work: taking off her clothing, rushing 
into a shower, washing off her cell 
phone, cleaning it before she sees her 
family. This is a person who is a crimi-
nal? She is a criminal for what she 
does, Cinthya Ramirez—really? I don’t 
understand the thinking. 
To call the decision last week—the 
week before—before the Supreme Court 
disgraceful is to say that she should 
have no chance. She should be gone. 
What has she got to offer to the United 
States of America, to the State of Ten-
nessee, to our future? She has a lot to 
offer, and most Americans, even an 
overwhelming majority of Republicans, 
get that part of it. 
Now the Senator comes before us 
today with a consistent record on 
Dreamers. Every moment that he has 
been in the U.S. Senate, whenever he 
has been given a chance—whenever—to 
help the Dreamers or to help DACA, 
the junior Senator from Texas has 
voted no, time and time and time 
again. He is consistent. Bless him for 
his consistency. 
Today he is not even offering an al-
ternative that would give this woman a 
chance—no alternative to the Dream 
and Promise Act. Instead he offers his 
own bill, which has nothing whatsoever 
to do with DACA and the Dreamers. 
The Cruz bill would increase penalties 
for immigration offenses, but anyone 
who commits any of the offenses that 
have been described by the Senator 
from Texas is already ineligible under 
DACA—ineligible. DACA requires ap-
plicants to clear criminal and national 
security background checks. Cinthya 
Ramirez has done that. To say that she 
is even close to committing a crime is 
an outrage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4089 
July 1, 2020 
Let’s be clear. The junior Senator 
from Texas is in the majority in the 
U.S. Senate. If he were serious about 
advancing his bill, he could ask the 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee to hold a committee vote on the 
bill. The Senator from Texas serves on 
that committee. Then he could ask the 
majority leader to schedule a floor 
vote. But he hasn’t done that. This bill 
that he brings to the floor today he has 
not even introduced as a bill in this 
session of Congress. 
In this session of Congress, with the 
Republicans in the majority, the immi-
gration subcommittee chaired by the 
other Senator of Texas has held one 
hearing. The Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee has voted on one immigration 
bill. There has not been a single vote 
on an immigration bill on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. 
Clearly, the Senator from Texas has 
no intention of trying to advance this 
bill that he passionately defended on 
the floor. He is offering it today to try 
to muddy the waters and somehow tie 
up this wonderful young nurse in Ten-
nessee with a horrible crime that was 
committed in California. She had noth-
ing to do with it. There is nothing in 
her life that is even close to that 
crime, and to put that as the alter-
native to DACA and the Dream Act is 
fundamentally and totally unfair. 
As long as I am in the Senate, I will 
come to the floor of the Senate to ad-
vocate for Cinthya Ramirez and all of 
the Dreamers. What an American trag-
edy it would be to deport this brave 
and talented young nurse who is saving 
lives in the midst of this pandemic. 
America is better than that. We must 
ensure that Cinthya and hundreds of 
thousands of others in our essential 
workforce are not forced to stop work-
ing. We need them now more than ever, 
and we must give them the chance they 
desire to let them become citizens of 
the United States. 
Madam President, I object to the 
unanimous consent request by the Sen-
ator from Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, COVID–19 
has taken a wrecking ball to our Na-
tion’s health and economy. No corner 
of the United States has been spared. 
Communities of color are being hit 
the hardest. We here in Congress must 
focus our work on helping these com-
munities. We must take on the long-
standing systemic reasons that these 
communities entering this crisis are 
entering at a greater risk. We must 
enact real reform so that the next time 
the next pandemic or economic down-
turn hits, it is not these same commu-
nities that once again bear the brunt of 
the disaster. 
Today, I want to focus our attention 
on American Indian and Alaska Native 
communities—communities where in-
fection and mortality rates are much 
higher than the overall U.S. population 
and communities that can’t escape the 
economic hardships this pandemic has 
caused. 
We already knew that pandemics like 
this take an awful toll on Native com-
munities. This was true 100 years ago 
during the 1918 flu pandemic when Na-
tive Americans died at four times the 
rate of the rest of the country. This 
was true a decade ago during the 2019 
H1N1 outbreak when Native Americans 
died at the same high rates. 
It is unforgivable that the adminis-
tration was not better prepared. 
The underlying reasons that Native 
peoples—whether 
living 
on 
Tribal 
lands, in urban settings, or elsewhere— 
are at risk are multifaceted. They are 
all rooted in historic systemic injus-
tice. 
First and foremost, many Native 
Americans do not have ready access to 
quality healthcare, despite the Federal 
Government’s trust and treaty obliga-
tions to provide it—trust and treaty 
obligations taken on by this govern-
ment in exchange for millions of acres 
of land and countless lives lost. 
On the large, rural reservations and 
in remote Alaskan Native villages, the 
nearest healthcare facility might be 
hours away, and when you get there, if 
you can get there, there often aren’t 
enough doctors or nurses or hospital 
beds. 
These logistical barriers are com-
pounded by the chronic, historic under-
funding of the Indian Health Service, 
which many of us have fought for years 
to 
correct. 
While 
we 
have 
made 
progress, the IHS budget still only cov-
ers an estimated 16 percent of the need. 
As a result of centuries of discrimi-
natory land, agricultural, and environ-
mental policies, Native communities 
also face the highest rates of under-
lying conditions, like diabetes, heart 
and lung disease, asthma, and obesity, 
that result in worse COVID–19 out-
comes. 
Battles over water rights and under-
investment in Tribal infrastructure 
have compounded the problems. We all 
know that washing our hands is a crit-
ical measure to prevent the spread of 
COVID–19. Yet Tribal communities are 
3.7 times more likely to lack complete 
indoor plumbing than other U.S. house-
holds. On the Navajo Nation, which is 
confronting 
one 
of 
the 
worse 
coronavirus outbreaks in the Nation, 18 
percent of households don’t have com-
plete indoor plumbing. So, again, it is 
no surprise that researchers have al-
ready found that COVID–19 cases are 
more likely to occur in Tribal commu-
nities, with a higher proportion of 
homes lacking indoor plumbing. 
We also know that social distancing 
is key to preventing the spread of the 
virus. Yet almost one in six Native 
households is overcrowded, making so-
cial distancing not just difficult but 
physically impossible for many fami-
lies. 
All these institutional barriers com-
bine to create a perfect storm. These 
barriers aren’t the result of chance; 
they are the result of policy. It is these 
institutional barriers that we must ac-
knowledge and finally address so that 
this pandemic is not one more example 
of the failure of the United States to 
meet our obligations. This time must 
be different. We must meet our respon-
sibilities and help build a more just 
and equitable society. 
Throughout this crisis, Native com-
munities have fought back. They are 
resilient. They have fought back hard. 
For example, in my home State of New 
Mexico and in Arizona and Utah, the 
Navajo Nation has imposed strict cur-
fews to prevent the spread. They have 
ramped up testing despite the complete 
lack of testing supplies in the begin-
ning, and they have now, as of today, 
tested about 25 percent of their popu-
lation, compared to 10 percent nation-
ally. 
Tribal responses to the pandemic 
have been repeatedly hamstrung by 
this administration and congressional 
inaction. As vice chair of the Senate 
Indian Affairs Committee, I fought 
hard for funding targeted for Tribes. 
When the administration offered noth-
ing for Tribes, we secured over $10 bil-
lion in the CARES Act. When the ad-
ministration fumbled distribution of 
Tribal funding, missing the statutory 
deadline for distribution by almost 2 
months, 
Congress 
and 
the 
Tribes 
pushed back. Because Tribes are in cri-
sis, days matter. It took a lawsuit and 
a Federal court order for Tribes to get 
their share of the $8 billion set aside 
for them under the CARES Act. 
Today, the Senate Indian Affairs 
Committee will hold an oversight hear-
ing on implementation of Federal pro-
grams to support Tribal COVID–19 pre-
vention, containment, and response ef-
forts. Tribal witnesses will testify that 
policies and practices at FEMA, the 
CDC, HRSA, and a number of other 
Federal Agencies have made Tribal ac-
cess to Federal COVID–19 resources 
much harder. 
Whether it is denying Tribes access 
to coronavirus surveillance data, cre-
ating a confusing, Byzantine bureauc-
racy for requesting emergency medical 
supplies, or delaying access to grant 
funds, this administration continually 
makes decisions that disadvantage Na-
tive 
communities, 
decisions 
that 
threaten Native lives and prolong this 
country’s legacy of systemic injustice. 
The administration must do better, 
and Congress must do much more. 
Each day we fail to act to advance poli-
cies to address the disparities faced by 
Indian Country is a day we fail to up-
hold our oath of office. The Republican 
Senate majority has delayed far too

long. Infections are on the rise. The 
United States has surpassed every 
other nation in the world in the spread 
and death and destruction of this virus. 
Now, 20 million Americans are out of 
work, which is the highest unemploy-
ment level since the Great Depression. 
State and local and Tribal govern-
ments and healthcare systems across 
the Nation are shuttering essential 
services 
and 
furloughing 
essential 
workers. None of this should come as 
news to the Republican majority. 
Inaction in the face of this disaster is 
unconscionable. This body must get 
down to the business that we are here 
for and we are elected to do. It is long 
past time we pass another COVID–19 
relief package. Our next package must 
include targeted funding and programs 
for Native communities and Tribes. We 
must infuse IHS with additional fund-
ing for Tribal healthcare and ensure it 
has parity in accessing Federal pro-
grams. We must provide Tribal govern-
ments with the resources they need to 
keep their communities up and running 
safely by providing $20 billion in addi-
tional targeted funding within the 
Treasury’s Coronavirus Relief Fund. 
The Senate should pass bills I have 
introduced that have already been 
adopted by the House of Representa-
tives in its Heroes package, which was 
passed over 6 weeks ago. We must 
make our strategic stockpile available 
to Tribes. Tribes should be able to ac-
cess PPE, ventilators, and other nec-
essary 
medical 
equipment 
just 
as 
States can. We must make sure that 
Tribes have equal access to the Centers 
for Disease Control and their resources 
to prepare for public health emer-
gencies like this pandemic. 
Seventy percent of Native Americans 
live in urban settings. Yet the Med-
icaid reimbursement rate for Urban In-
dian Health facilities is lower than the 
Federal reimbursement rate at other 
IHS facilities. We need to balance the 
scales and help the 43 Urban Indian 
Health facilities across the Nation ex-
pand their services. 
As so much of our lives move to the 
internet, we must make sure that Na-
tive schools, healthcare facilities, and 
government services are not left on the 
wrong side of the digital divide. All 
Tribes must have access to high-speed 
broadband. 
This public health and economic cri-
sis has hit us all hard, but we shouldn’t 
deny that some communities have been 
hit hard. We need to send immediate 
relief to those communities that have 
been so severely hurt, including Native 
communities, and we need to set our 
sights on genuinely taking on the sys-
temic and institutional barriers these 
communities have faced for far too 
long. We can, we should, and we must 
do better. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today, with my colleague, the Senator 
from New Mexico, TOM UDALL, to call 
for urgent action by Congress to re-
spond to the needs of Tribal nations 
and 
urban 
indigenous 
communities 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
We have not done enough. We have 
not lived up to our shared trust and 
treaty obligations. And in this mo-
ment, we are called upon to respond to 
the historic injustice and systems of 
oppression and institutional violence 
that are harming communities of color 
and indigenous people. 
Over the last month, people in Min-
nesota and across our country have fo-
cused our attention on the deep sys-
temic inequities that Black, Brown, 
and indigenous people face. This injus-
tice is not new. It is as old as the col-
onization of our country, but, col-
leagues, this is a unique moment. 
This public health crisis presents us 
with an opportunity to show that we 
are serious about repairing the damage 
done by our broken promises to sov-
ereign Tribal nations and urban indige-
nous communities. 
Some have said that COVID–19 is the 
great equalizer, but we know that 
COVID hits hardest those without a 
safe place to call home, those strug-
gling with low wages and poverty and 
lack of healthcare, and Black, Brown, 
and indigenous people living with the 
trauma of having their identity and 
their very humanity called into ques-
tion, even before this virus spread. 
The impact of COVID on Native com-
munities has been devastating. Native 
people 
have 
been 
hospitalized 
for 
COVID at five times the rate of White 
people. In mid-May, the Navajo Nation 
reached a higher per-capita infection 
rate than any other hotspot in the 
country. 
Why is it that COVID is hitting Trib-
al nations so hard? Despite repeated 
calls from Tribal leaders and urban in-
digenous leaders, over the past few dec-
ades, the Federal Government has 
stood by and allowed the budget of the 
Indian Health Service to dwindle. They 
have neglected Indian housing pro-
grams, and they have ignored growing 
health inequities. 
The Federal institutions dedicated to 
serving Indian Country are not broken. 
Unfortunately, these institutions have 
never been adequate to live up to our 
trust and treaty responsibilities, and 
they represent a broken promise. 
The Federal Government’s failure 
has life-and-death consequences for Na-
tive people—for their health, for their 
well-being, and for their opportunity to 
provide for their families. 
Think of this striking statistic: Un-
employment in the indigenous commu-
nity in the Twin Cities is at a terrible 
47 percent—higher than any other 
group in our State. 
Within Tribal nations, the economic 
impact of the coronavirus is equally 
devastating. Early this spring, Tribal 
governments in Minnesota and all 
around the country made the difficult 
decision to voluntarily close Tribal en-
terprises in order to protect public 
health. As a result, they lost signifi-
cant government revenue and also ex-
perienced massive unemployment, not 
only for their members but for mem-
bers from the surrounding commu-
nities. This lost revenue meant that 
Tribal governments were forced to 
scale back essential services, like nu-
trition assistance for elders, public 
safety, and education programming. 
In the CARES Act, Congress agreed 
to $8 billion in emergency relief to help 
Tribes respond to COVID. Even after 
congressional action, though, Tribal 
governments have had to continue 
fighting to get their fair share of those 
dollars. The Trump administration ar-
gued that some of this relief should go 
to for-profit Alaska Native corpora-
tions. Then it took the Treasury De-
partment 40 days to distribute just the 
first 60 percent of the funds to Tribes, 
and not until 2 weeks ago, almost 3 
months after passage of the CARES 
Act, did Tribal governments receive 
the rest. To be clear, these funds can-
not be used to replace lost revenue. 
We have so much work to do to fulfill 
our commitment to indigenous people 
and the simple proposition that Native 
families should have equal access to 
healthcare and housing opportunity as 
White Americans. 
When I speak to Tribal leaders in my 
State about this cycle of historic 
underinvestment, inequity, and broken 
promises, I share their frustration. I 
don’t know how anybody couldn’t. 
Indigenous 
leaders 
in 
Minnesota 
know that a lack of housing on Tribal 
lands leads to overcrowding, which in-
creases the risk of contracting COVID. 
Tribes have asked over and over for 
sufficient funding for housing pro-
grams. They shouldn’t have to ask any-
more. 
Indigenous leaders know a lack of ac-
cess to healthcare and substance abuse 
disorder treatment lead to chronic 
health conditions, like diabetes, heart 
disease, and asthma, which worsen 
COVID symptoms. Tribes have asked 
over and over for sufficient funding to 
address these health inequities, and 
they shouldn’t have to ask anymore. 
Indigenous leaders know that a lack 
of access to credit and capital prevents 
urban indigenous households and folks 
living on Tribal lands from building 
wealth like their White neighbors, who 
can more easily, therefore, weather the 
storm of unemployment. 
Native communities have asked over 
and over to enforce fair lending laws 
and to ensure access to credit for mi-
nority borrowers, and they shouldn’t 
have to ask anymore. Long before 
COVID, these inequities have harmed 
indigenous people. Our inaction has 
placed Tribal nations in the untenable 
position of having to ask for what they 
are already owed.

July 1, 2020 
So let’s take this extraordinary mo-
ment—a terrible moment but a mo-
ment of real opportunity, a moment 
when our country is called to respond 
to this terrible pandemic and to reckon 
with systemic inequities that have 
hurt Native people and even sought to 
erase them—and let’s turn this mo-
ment to good. 
We have an opportunity not only to 
address the public health and economic 
crisis of COVID but also to live up to 
our obligation to Tribes, like providing 
them with the tools to build resiliency 
in their communities. 
First, we need to provide rapid, flexi-
ble support to Tribal governments so 
that they can respond to COVID–19 and 
provide essential services to Tribal 
members at the same time. 
Second, let’s live up to our promises 
and fully fund the Indian Health Serv-
ice and the NAHASDA housing pro-
grams. When we do this, we will be ad-
dressing the shortage of physical and 
behavioral healthcare for young adults 
and parents and elders, and we will 
make it easier for families to find af-
fordable safe places to live and to build 
wealth through homeownership. 
We can do this. It is within our 
power. We can end this cycle of under-
investment and institutional violence. 
This is the best moment in a genera-
tion to accomplish this. 
I am committed to lifting up the 
voices of indigenous leaders in Min-
nesota and around this country. I fol-
low their lead, and I will continue to 
advocate for these changes because 
they are so long overdue. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to 
join me in this work. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
FOURTH OF JULY 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, 160 
years ago, Abraham Lincoln reminded 
us that ‘‘at all times . . . all American 
citizens are brothers of a common 
country, and should dwell together in 
the bonds of fraternal feeling.’’ 
That bond—our commitment to com-
ing together to move our country for-
ward, our embrace of the challenges 
our country faces because we know we 
will 
come 
out 
of 
these 
moments 
strong—has made the United States ex-
ceptional. 
As we approach the Fourth of July 
holiday, I want to take a moment to 
recognize what makes America who she 
is today and the values that have al-
lowed us to carry on the Great Amer-
ican Experiment for 244 years. 
The United States—the shining city 
on a hill, the land of opportunity, the 
land of the free and the home of the 
brave, the red, white, and blue—our 
country is exceptional precisely be-
cause we have never settled for any-
thing less. 
It was that very reason it was Ameri-
cans who first discovered electricity, 
built the airplane, put a man on the 
Moon, developed chemotherapy, and 
that other countries look to us for 
leadership during troubled times. It is 
why we prevailed in two world wars, 
defeated the axis of evil, and have since 
maintained the greatest Armed Forces 
in the world. It is why the ideal of the 
American dream exists. 
Importantly, it is the American peo-
ple, past and present, who have shaped 
our American character—the 56 men 
who put their lives on the line to draft 
and sign the Declaration of Independ-
ence in 1776; the volunteer army of 
farmers and shopkeepers who defeated 
the British and today has grown into 
the best fighting force the world has 
ever seen. 
Fifty-five Americans came together 
to write the U.S. Constitution, guaran-
teeing the freedoms for Americans to 
worship, to speak out, to bear arms, 
and to peaceably assemble. In the years 
that followed, America fulfilled its 
promise to form a more perfect union 
while acknowledging it is not perfect 
but always striving to do better. 
We ended the injustice of slavery; 100 
years ago this year, gave women the 
right to vote; overcame the Great De-
pression; fought for the equal rights of 
all Americans during the civil rights 
movement; and persevered after Sep-
tember 11. 
Today we still have those heroes who 
make America what she is today. We 
see these works in our midst every day: 
our service men and women who brave-
ly protect us across the globe and keep 
the enemy away from our shores; the 
dedicated men and women of law en-
forcement who work tirelessly to keep 
our communities and our families safe; 
our teachers, who provide the gift of 
education to our youth; our doctors 
and nurses, who save lives every day 
and have bravely taken on the chal-
lenge of COVID–19. 
American 
exceptionalism 
started 
with our humble beginnings, and it has 
endured throughout the challenges our 
country faces. 
It is tempting to focus on the divi-
sions in America today, but we have 
much more in common that unites us. 
This Fourth of July is a reminder of 
the blessings of life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness that all Americans 
deserve. 
President Reagan once said: 
Freedom is a fragile thing and is never 
more than one generation away from extinc-
tion. It is not ours by inheritance; it must be 
fought for and defended constantly by each 
generation, for it comes only once to a peo-
ple. 
I agree, and I hope this Fourth of 
July we can stand together, proud that 
we will strive to make this country a 
more perfect union. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
S. 4049 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise to address a glaring inequality in 
the law—one that leaves our service-
members with fewer protections from 
discrimination than civilians. On June 
15, the Supreme Court issued a momen-
tous decision—welcomed by Members 
of both parties—extending civil rights 
employment protections to LGBTQ in-
dividuals in workplaces across Amer-
ica. That decision, however, does not 
apply to servicemembers. That means 
our servicemembers, who often come 
from communities that have for gen-
erations bravely sacrificed for the 
United States, currently enjoy fewer 
statutory protections than their civil-
ian counterparts. 
Think about what that says about 
our country: The law treats the people 
willing to risk their lives to defend our 
freedoms as second class citizens. It is 
unconscionable, and it is un-American. 
In this moment of reckoning on civil 
rights, we must ensure those rights ex-
tend to all of our military servicemem-
bers. 
The push for the desegregation of our 
troops, for gender integration into 
combat, and for the repeal of don’t ask, 
don’t tell were all met with similar ar-
guments about how increased oppor-
tunity for the group in question would 
hamper readiness, unit cohesion, or 
otherwise weaken the military. Those 
arguments have been proven wrong 
every single time. 
It is, in fact, the lack of protections 
for these groups that hamper readiness. 
Without protections, an able platoon 
sergeant can be stigmatized and driven 
from 
the 
military 
because 
he 
is 
transgender. His years of experience 
and the immense investments the mili-
tary has made in him can be erased 
with the stroke of a pen. 
Our military has grown only stronger 
as it better represents our country. 
But, right now, in the year 2020, people 
who are willing to make extraordinary 
sacrifices for our freedoms are being 
told no simply because of who they are. 
We must do better. And we can. We 
can make sure the National Defense 
Authorization Act includes discrimina-
tion protections for all servicemem-
bers. 
My amendment with Senator COLLINS 
would codify in the law that service-
members of all races, religions, and 
sexes are protected from discrimina-
tion. It would affirm that Americans of 
every race, religion, sex, sexual ori-
entation, gender identity, and national 
origin have the right to join and serve 
and sacrifice in our military. 
I was proud to have Senator John 
McCain join me in leading similar leg-
islation to protect transgender troops 3 
years ago. The late Senator said: ‘‘Any 
member of the military who meets the 
medical and readiness standards should 
be allowed to serve—including those 
who are transgender.’’ I hope this will 
be the year that we deliver the results 
he wanted for our troops. 
Placing language safeguarding this 
right into the NDAA can help us begin 
to overcome an unfortunate legacy of 
creating artificial, blatantly unfair 
barriers to service by underrepresented 
groups. It is a legacy that continues to

this day with the Trump administra-
tion’s ban on transgender servicemem-
bers. 
That discriminatory ban is not only 
an 
insult 
to 
members 
of 
the 
transgender 
community 
who 
have 
served our country; it is an insult to 
every LGBTQ person who has given 
their life to protect it. Arguments 
against open transgender service have 
no basis in experience or in science. 
Transgender individuals served open-
ly in the military for more than 21⁄2 
years without any readiness or cohe-
sion issues. I know because I asked all 
four service chiefs and the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and they all 
confirmed it. The Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, who 
was then Chief of Staff of the Army, 
told me that he had received ‘‘precisely 
zero reports of issues of cohesion, dis-
cipline, 
[or] 
morale’’ 
caused 
by 
transgender individuals in the service. 
The American Medical Association, 
the American Psychiatric Association, 
and other experts agree: There is no 
medically 
valid 
reason 
to 
exclude 
transgender individuals from military 
service. Anyone who can meet the mili-
tary standards should be allowed to 
serve—and serve in an environment 
free from discrimination. It is that 
simple. 
Our Armed Services should reflect 
the best of what this country has to 
offer—in their values and in their 
ranks. We cannot allow for laws that 
unnecessarily limit their ability to re-
cruit and retain the best person for the 
job. 
I ask my colleagues to support our 
troops with more than lip service. I ask 
my colleagues to extend to them pro-
tections from discrimination based on 
race, religion, or sex. These are people 
who are willing to fight for our coun-
try. These are people who are willing 
to die for our country. This body and 
our country must be willing to fight 
for them. My amendment will do ex-
actly that. I ask all of you to support 
its inclusion in this year’s NDAA. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COL-
LINS). The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise again to address another 
issue. I rise because, according to the 
Pentagon’s recent biannual survey, al-
most 21,000 servicemembers were sexu-
ally assaulted in the year 2018. That 
was a 38-percent increase from the year 
before. 
I rise because the current climate of 
retaliation in our armed services and 
the lack of justice provided by the 
chain of command meant nearly three- 
quarters of those assaults went unre-
ported, and less than 10 percent of 
cases considered for command action 
went to trial—less than 10 percent. 
I rise because I stood in this very 
Chamber in 2013 and shared essentially 
the same statistics. 
Year after year, the leaders of our 
armed services come to Congress and 
commit to making things better. They 
commit to us in hearing after hearing: 
We will get this right. Yet, year after 
year, thousands of servicemembers are 
raped and sexually assaulted, and their 
assailants are not held accountable. 
In many of those cases, the assailant 
is someone in the survivor’s chain of 
command—the same chain of command 
that will decide the case, picking 
judge, jury, prosecutor, defense coun-
sel—all decided by a commander in 
that chain of command. 
There is no other judicial system in 
America that would ever allow this to 
happen. This system is not delivering 
justice. The chain of command is not 
delivering justice. These decisions— 
these fundamental civil rights deci-
sions—need to be made somewhere else. 
They need to be made by trained, im-
partial military professionals, prosecu-
tors, lawyers—people who are trained 
to make this very hard decision. 
We are asking survivors to come for-
ward in an environment where they 
know that there is less than a 10-per-
cent chance that the chain of command 
will try their assailant for a crime 
and—worse—that there is only a two in 
three chance that they themselves— 
they themselves—will face retaliation. 
Despite repeated efforts to stamp out 
the scourge of retaliation against mili-
tary sexual assault survivors, the most 
recent Pentagon survey found that 64 
percent of these survivors have experi-
enced some form of retaliation for re-
porting the crime. This figure is statis-
tically unchanged from 2016. It is unac-
ceptable. 
I ask you: Who is this system de-
signed for? 
I think so often about a Marine vet-
eran who told me: 
When I reported the assault, my command 
responded with retaliation . . . ostracism, 
intimidation, and isolation. The humiliation 
of the retaliation was worse than the assault 
because it was sanctioned from those same 
leaders I once would have risked my life for. 
The climate of retaliation comes 
from the top. It comes from the chain 
of command. They should not be decid-
ing these cases. They do not have the 
background or the impartiality nec-
essary to deliver justice. This system is 
broken, and it is failing our service-
members. 
This Congress has passed and spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars on in-
cremental reforms since 2013. During 
this time, an estimated 137,000 service-
members have been assaulted. 
Let me say that again. During that 
time, 137,000 servicemembers have been 
sexually assaulted. 
What are we doing here? Can we not 
hold the U.S. military accountable? 
Can we not do our jobs? Can we not 
stand up for the men and women who 
risk their lives for us every day? 
Incremental change that leaves the 
power in the hands of the chain of com-
mand is not enough. We have the proof 
and the evidence. 
‘‘We’ve got this ma’am; we’ve got 
this.’’ They say it every year. They 
don’t have it, and they haven’t had it 
for the last 7 years we have been fo-
cused on this very issue. It does not do 
enough to protect our servicemembers 
from sexual assault in the ranks or to 
punish perpetrators who commit these 
violent crimes. 
Just for a minute, imagine this is 
your daughter or your son. Imagine 
just for a minute that your children de-
cide to go into the military. Do you 
think they will be protected? 
My bill, the Military Justice Im-
provement Act, is being offered as an 
amendment to the NDAA. This amend-
ment will professionalize how the mili-
tary prosecutes serious crimes like sex-
ual assault, and it will remove the sys-
temic fear that survivors have to re-
port these crimes. Survivors don’t re-
port these crimes because they fear the 
retaliation against them. 
This bipartisan and commonsense re-
form leaves the majority of uniquely 
military crimes, as well as all crimes 
punishable by less than 1 year of con-
finement, within the chain of com-
mand. It would only move one deci-
sion—literally, one decision—that only 
3 percent of commanders actually have 
the right to make, and that decision 
will be made by a trained military 
prosecutor. 
These prosecutors, or military JAGS, 
are required to be licensed attorneys in 
good standing with their State bar as-
sociations and are subject to profes-
sional rules of ethics. Those are com-
monsense standards, but they are not 
the standards that commanders have 
to meet. Commanders aren’t typically 
lawyers. They are not typically crimi-
nal lawyers. They are not trained in 
how to make this fundamental decision 
about whether a crime has been com-
mitted. So why wouldn’t you let mili-
tary police investigate the crime just 
as they do today? 
They take that investigation and, in-
stead of putting it on the commander’s 
general counsel’s desk, they will put it 
on a military prosecutor’s desk. The 
military prosecutor gets to make a de-
cision: yes or no; I can prosecute or I 
can’t. Then, that file goes right back to 
the commander. So when the com-
mander wants to do nonjudicial punish-
ment, he gets to do it. Every time a 
prosecutor says there is no case here, 
he gets to have the same authority he 
has today. 
Under today’s standards, only 10 per-
cent of these cases go to trial. That 
would mean the commanders don’t get 
to make that one decision that 3 per-
cent of them get to make 10 percent of 
the time because 90 percent of the time 
it comes right back to the commander 
to do whatever nonjudicial punishment 
he or she thinks is appropriate. 
This is a very small but important 
change because when you make this 
change, the survivor sees that the deci-
sion isn’t being made within her chain 
of command. She or he sees that the 
decision is being made by somebody 
trained to make the decision—someone 
who is actually a prosecutor. He or she 
will then believe it is worth reporting 
the crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4093 
July 1, 2020 
So many of these crimes don’t even 
get reported and, sadly, the percentage 
of those that are being reported is 
going up—the percentage of those re-
ported confidentially. It doesn’t show 
that there is any faith in the system if 
people will only report if they don’t 
name their perpetrator. 
This reform is nothing new. This re-
form has been done all across the world 
by our allies. Our allies in the United 
Kingdom, Canada, Israel, Germany, 
and Australia have all removed report-
ing and prosecution of violent sex 
crimes out of the chain of command. 
Leaders in those militaries have re-
ported that these changes have not di-
minished their ability in any way. It 
has not diminished their commanders’ 
ability to maintain good order and dis-
cipline, to train their troops, and to do 
what they are there for. 
Congress owes our servicemembers a 
debt of gratitude that can never be 
fully repaid. These brave men and 
women who have experienced the un-
imaginable are counting on us this 
year to finally take real action. Until 
we do, we continue to fail in our re-
sponsibility to protect them. 
Madam President, this is something 
we have worked on together for over 7 
years. This is something that, on a bi-
partisan 
basis, 
this 
Chamber 
has 
worked on for 7 years. We have been de-
nied a vote on this over the last 5 
years—denied a vote on this the last 5 
years. The military has fought tooth 
and nail to not put in these funda-
mental reforms. They ask us over and 
over: Trust us; we got this. Trust us; 
we got this. 
They don’t have it. They haven’t had 
it, and they don’t focus on it. 
If you just look at the report from 
this year alone, we are up to 20,000— 
over 20,000—sexual assaults in the last 
year. The percentage of cases that are 
being reported confidentially is going 
up. The percentage of cases that are 
being reported openly is going down. 
The percentage of cases that are going 
to trial is going down. The percentage 
of cases ending in conviction is going 
down. So under no measure today has 
the military succeeded in this mission, 
under absolutely none. They say they 
got this. They don’t have it. They 
never have. And if we don’t do our job 
this year, they never will. 
This is not something new. This is 
something that other countries that 
are our allies have done. It profes-
sionalizes the military. It gives hope to 
survivors. It creates permission for 
them to report these crimes. If more 
crimes are reported, more prosecutions 
will be completed, and more cases will 
end in conviction. 
Send a message: Convict perpetra-
tors. Protect survivors. Honor the sac-
rifice and legacy of every man and 
woman who serves in the military 
today who will give their life for this 
country. That is our responsibility. 
I urge everyone in this Chamber to 
stand with our troops. Stand with the 
men and women who sacrifice every-
thing, and do the right thing. It is our 
job. We are supposed to provide over-
sight and accountability over the U.S. 
military. It is the Senate’s job, and 
every year that we don’t address this 
fundamental scourge is another year 
we fail. 
I am tired of this Chamber failing our 
servicemembers. I am tired of our com-
manders and our military failing our 
servicemembers. We owe everything to 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, last 
night, the Senate approved legislation 
to extended the Paycheck Protection 
Program, 
better 
known 
as 
PPP, 
through August 8, while we continue 
bipartisan negotiations on a bill to pro-
vide additional assistance to our small 
businesses that have been especially 
hard hit by COVID–19 mitigation meas-
ures. 
I very much hope that the House of 
Representatives will act quickly to ex-
tend this important lifeline for our 
small employers, as new PPP loans 
cannot be issued until the bill that 
passed the Senate last night is enacted 
and signed into law, even though ap-
proximately $130 billion remains avail-
able for the program. 
Let me, again, commend my partners 
in 
this 
endeavor, 
Senators 
MARCO 
RUBIO, BEN CARDIN, and JEANNE SHA-
HEEN, for their continued work on this 
vital program. 
Back in March, the four of us formed 
a small business task force. We looked 
at ways that we could help our small 
employers and their employees survive 
this pandemic. We put forth a bold 
plan, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, to help small employers and 
their 
employees. 
Our 
concept 
was 
straightforward: 
provide 
forgivable 
loans to small employers to help them 
maintain that vital connection with 
their employees, so that both could re-
bound and thrive once the pandemic 
passes. 
In some cases, that meant that a 
small business could retain an em-
ployee who, otherwise, would have been 
laid off. In others, it has meant that 
the small business could recall workers 
who had already been laid off. And in 
yet other cases, it allowed employers 
to continue to send paychecks to em-
ployees who had been furloughed so 
that we could keep that link between 
employers and their employees, so that 
when the reopening occurred, they 
could be reunited quickly and the busi-
ness could get up and running much 
more rapidly. 
The response to this program has 
been phenomenal. Since its launch in 
early April, it has provided $518 billion 
in forgivable loans to 4.8 million small 
employers across the Nation. 
According to an ongoing U.S. Census 
Survey, nearly three out of every four 
small business respondents reported 
that 
they 
had 
received 
assistance 
under the PPP program. In Maine, 
nearly 27,000 small businesses have re-
ceived forgivable loans, totaling more 
than $2.2 billion. Just to give you an 
idea of how much of a stimulus that is, 
that is equal to almost half of the en-
tire State budget. That works out to an 
average loan size of $83,400, which 
translates into a small business with 
approximately seven employees. All 
told, this program is helping to sustain 
nearly 200,000 jobs in the State of 
Maine. 
As 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Steve 
Mnuchin testified last month: 
The [Paycheck Protection Program] is sup-
porting the employment of approximately 50 
million workers and more than 75 percent of 
small business payroll in all 50 states. This is 
an extraordinary achievement. 
It is, indeed. It has made such a dif-
ference to our small employers. It has 
kept our small businesses afloat, pre-
vented them from giving up and shut-
tering their doors forever, and provided 
paychecks to their employees. 
When we first drafted this program in 
early March, we did not know how long 
government-ordered 
closures 
would 
last. In fact, most of them had not even 
gone into effect at the time that we 
drafted the law. We also did not know 
how severe the impacts of these gov-
ernment-ordered closures would be. We 
did not know how long the pandemic 
would last. How I wish that we could 
announce today that COVID–19 had 
been conquered; that America’s small 
businesses were flourishing once again; 
and that the millions of jobs that they 
provide had been fully restored. Unfor-
tunately, that is not the case, and we 
have a long road ahead of us. 
According to a survey released last 
week by NFIB, an organization that is 
dedicated to providing a voice for 
America’s small businesses, half of its 
members anticipate needing additional 
financial 
support 
in 
the 
next 
12 
months. 
I fear that, if Congress fails to act, 
despite our good work to date, millions 
of our small businesses will be put at 
risk, and millions of jobs will be lost. 
A case study of how the pandemic 
has threatened the viability of small 
businesses can be found in Maine’s 
tourism sector. Tourism is one of our 
State’s largest economic sectors. It 
supports 110,000 jobs. That is one out of 
every six jobs in our State. In 2018, 
total tourism expenditures exceeded 
$6.2 billion. That is $7 million per day. 
In late March, there was the expecta-
tion that the 2020 tourism season would 
certainly be lower than the norm but 
active enough for the tourism busi-
nesses to survive. But, as the Fourth of 
July draws closer, near empty hotels, 
inns, B&Bs, and restaurants portend a 
long-lasting disaster, as many of our

State’s seasonal businesses rely on the 
busy summer season and fall season to 
pay their major bills for the year, in-
cluding their mortgage and property 
taxes, not to mention their all-impor-
tant employees. 
Two weeks ago, a Maine innkeeper in 
York County told me that her inn 
would normally have a 94-percent occu-
pancy rate at this point in the summer. 
She currently has an occupancy rate of 
6 percent. 
As one observer put it, the word ‘‘Va-
cationland,’’ which appears on our li-
cense plates in Maine, might well be 
replaced with ‘‘Vacancy Land.’’ 
I have heard from so many hotel 
owners throughout Maine, and their 
stories all have a familiar theme: Res-
ervations made months ago for July 
and August are being canceled, and 
cancelations for the fall are also start-
ing to come in. In addition to putting 
hotel staff at risk of losing their jobs, 
or having their hours cut drastically, 
or not being hired in the first place, 
the vendors that supply these estab-
lishments are losing sales. Local retail-
ers and restaurants are losing summer 
customers. Planned improvements and 
expansions are being postponed, caus-
ing harm for local tradespeople. 
I talked to a restaurant owner who 
operates a wonderful restaurant in 
Portland. Right now, she has to depend 
on outside seating and lives in fear of a 
bad storm, where people won’t be able 
to eat outside. Only slowly is Maine al-
lowing in-restaurant eating to resume 
in the most populous parts of our 
State. All of us understand that we 
have to put the health of people first, 
but these restaurant owners are get-
ting desperate, and they are trying 
very hard to comply with all the CDC 
regulations. 
There is no doubt that similar dis-
ruptions are occurring across the coun-
try. That is why it is so important that 
we reach bipartisan agreement to allow 
those small businesses that have been 
especially hard hit by the pandemic to 
receive an additional forgivable loan. 
As we continue our bipartisan negotia-
tions on such a plan, I have come to 
the floor to outline some of my own 
priorities for a second Paycheck Pro-
tection Program loan. 
First, I do believe that we will 
achieve bipartisan agreement to allow 
the hardest hit small business employ-
ers—those who have seen their reve-
nues decline by 50 percent or more in 
any quarter this year compared to the 
same quarter last year—to receive an 
additional PPP loan. This is absolutely 
essential to the ability of these busi-
nesses to survive as the fight against 
COVID–19 continues. 
Second, because we must stretch the 
$130 billion that remains in the PPP 
funds as far as we possibly can, I sup-
port generally limiting eligibility to 
entities that have 300, rather than 500 
or fewer, employees with a special pro-
vision for seasonal employers. 
Third, I believe that we need to ex-
pand forgivable PPP expenses in some 
commonsense ways. For example, we 
should allow forgiveness for supplier 
costs and investments in facility modi-
fications 
and 
personal 
protective 
equipment that employers are buying 
to protect their employees and their 
customers, such as plexiglass shields, 
patio installations for outdoor dining, 
masks, gloves—that kind of equipment. 
It is especially important to res-
taurants facing dining restrictions and 
those struggling to get the high-qual-
ity food supply that they need. We 
should also clarify that employer-pro-
vided group health benefits are in-
cluded in forgivable payroll costs. 
Fourth, we should extend the PPP to 
small 501(c)(6) organizations that are 
not lobby organizations. I am talking 
about local chambers of commerce, 
business leagues, economic develop-
ment associations, and boards of trade, 
which are doing a great job but are 
struggling to themselves survive. 
Fifth, we should clarify in statute 
that forgivable loan funds can be spent 
through December 31 and allow bor-
rowers to apply for loan forgiveness, at 
the time of their choosing, after 8 
weeks from loan origination. 
Finally, to ensure transparency in 
the PPP loan program, we should re-
quire the Small Business Administra-
tion to comply with data and informa-
tion requests from the Government Ac-
countability Office or Federal inspec-
tors general within 15 days. 
There are many other ideas that the 
four of us who are members of the 
Small Business Task Force are taking 
a look at, but today, I just wanted to 
outline for my colleagues some ideas 
that I am particularly interested in in-
cluding in this bill. 
As the shutdowns have grown longer, 
it has become clear that millions of 
small employers need additional help if 
they are to keep their heads above 
water and survive. It also has been 
clear that many of these employers 
must make substantial investments to 
modify their operations, to protect 
their employees and customers, to 
mitigate the spread of the COVID 
virus. 
Most of all, we need to always keep 
in mind that we are talking about em-
ployees. It is the small businesses of 
our country that employ the majority 
of the people who are working. 
We are close to reaching a bipartisan 
agreement, and I know we are going to 
be working very hard over the recess to 
do so. I also know that, for small busi-
nesses that are struggling, such an 
agreement cannot come soon enough. 
Again, I want to thank my col-
leagues—Senator MARCO
RUBIO, Sen-
ator BEN CARDIN, Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN—for their dedication and good- 
faith efforts to reach an agreement. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
came before the Chamber yesterday 
and made the case as to why Congress 
needs to begin negotiations on another 
COVID–19 emergency supplemental bill 
and to do it now. The needs are real. 
They are immediate. In fact, when the 
House passed the Heroes Act, we should 
have begun those negotiations in the 
first week after it had passed it, but we 
didn’t. We should have begun the nego-
tiations in the second week after it had 
passed it, but we didn’t. We should 
have begun the negotiations in the 
third week after it had passed it, but 
we didn’t—and the fourth and the fifth 
and the sixth. 
Every day, I talk with Vermonters, 
sometimes hundreds at a time in state-
wide conference calls. From small busi-
nesses, to families, to schools, to hos-
pitals, to Federal employees, I hear 
their urgent needs. So I want to talk 
today about just one of those urgent 
needs—funding for the United States 
Citizenship and Immigration Services, 
USCIS. 
It plays an important role in our Na-
tion’s immigration system. It processes 
requests 
for 
immigration 
benefits, 
American citizenship, and it screens 
asylum seekers. The agency is staffed 
by more than 19,000 dedicated men and 
women across the country, including 
roughly 1,700 in my home State of 
Vermont. 
Last Friday, furlough notices were 
sent out to 13,350 of the 19,000 USCIS 
employees. They are effective next 
month, on August 3. That is just 4 
weeks from now. In Vermont, 1,111 men 
and women received this notice, which 
is over 65 percent of the USCIS work-
force in Vermont. These are men and 
women who, day after day, do impor-
tant work for the Nation. They have 
continued to do that work every day 
even during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
And they have been told, even though 
they have been doing the work loyally 
and effectively, after August 3, a 
month from now, they can no longer do 
their job; they will no longer receive a 
paycheck. 
Nationwide these are 13,350 new and 
urgent reasons why the Senate must 
act on our Nation’s real and immediate 
needs, and the Senate majority must 
make that possible now. We have lost 6 
weeks since the House acted on this. It 
is time the Senate acts. 
I have been ringing the alarm bells 
for more than a month on this issue. 
We know that due to declining revenue, 
immigration-related application fees 
coming into USCIS, the agency is fac-
ing a budget shortfall of $1.2 billion, 
and the furlough notices that were sud-
denly sent out last week are the result 
of this shortfall. USCIS is simply say-
ing they can’t pay employees with rev-
enues they do not have. 
I would remind everybody the short-
fall is not entirely due to COVID–19. 
The agency has not lived within its 
budget for the last 3 years of this ad-
ministration, and, frankly, the Trump 
administration’s mismanagement and 
extreme 
immigration 
policies 
have 
only worsened the situation. 
As part of the President’s efforts to 
erase our identity as a nation of immi-
grants, he has not just tried to shut

our Nation’s doors to asylum seekers 
and refugees, he has attempted to re-
strict almost all immigration to this 
country. 
He has created obstacles for immi-
grant workers, created a wealth test 
for immigrants, even exploited the cur-
rent public health emergency to im-
pose additional immigration restric-
tions that have nothing to do with pub-
lic health. 
And because USCIS has not been able 
to issue visas or process other immi-
gration benefits as they normally do as 
a result of President Trump’s anti-im-
migrant policies, revenue, of course, 
has fallen. 
No matter the cause, the budget 
shortfall is real. We have to address it. 
Furloughs would not only disrupt the 
processing of immigration benefits and 
American citizenship and other critical 
services provided by USCIS, but it is 
going to cause unnecessary hardships 
on thousands of Federal employees and 
Federal contractors. It is going to 
come at a time when our Nation is al-
ready dealing with record job losses. 
The loss of these valuable jobs will 
also cause hardship to the communities 
across the Nation where these Federal 
workers live and work. These are com-
munities already struggling with the 
pandemic. They were dealing with peo-
ple who have skills that have been 
built up over years of experience. 
So let’s craft a fair, responsible solu-
tion to this problem. That would re-
quire emergency appropriations and ac-
companying 
legislation 
to 
ensure 
transparency and accountability. 
Time is of the essence. I know, as 
vice chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, we have agreement on the 
vast majority of the possible appropria-
tions bills. There has been a concern by 
the Republican majority not to bring 
them up because they do not want 
something on COVID. 
Well, every Senator can go home and 
talk to their people in their State. 
They will hear, as I do every single day 
in my calls from Vermonters, there is a 
need to do something regarding COVID. 
Now, there have been numerous calls 
by myself and the Democratic leader-
ship in the Senate, and despite those 
calls, the White House and the Repub-
lican majority have refused to move 
forward on a fourth COVID–19 emer-
gency appropriations bill where we 
could address this and other critical 
issues caused by the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
We should not wait any longer. In 
fact, we must not wait any longer. I 
call on Majority Leader MCCONNELL to 
begin bipartisan negotiations on a 
COVID–19 emergency relief bill now so 
we can solve this problem before fur-
loughs are necessary. 
The Senate is about to recess for 2 
weeks, but that doesn’t mean our work 
stops. With millions of people working 
from home due to the coronavirus, in-
cluding in the U.S. Senate, we have 
shown that we can do our job from 
wherever we are located. 
I know, on the major COVID bill, my 
staff and I worked 7 days a week, some-
times very late into the night, and we 
are all in separate locations, but we 
got it done, and we got an appropria-
tions bill through here that almost all 
Republicans and Democrats voted for 
because people worked together. We 
worked together. We passed legislation 
this country needed. 
We showed it can be done, so we can 
and we should begin bipartisan, bi-
cameral negotiations. Do it during the 
next 2 weeks so that when the Senate 
is back in session, we have legislation 
to consider and debate. We can enact 
the bill into law expeditiously. 
If there are amendments people want 
or things they want to change, vote 
them up or vote them down. We should 
be willing to stand here and vote, and 
then we can enact a bill into law and 
do it expeditiously. 
The American people deserve no less. 
The dedicated men and women at 
USCIS deserve no less, but I would say 
the men and women of every single one 
of our States deserve no less. 
There are 100 of us here. We have 
shown we can work together. We have 
done it before. We have done it with ap-
propriations bills. We sat here, voted 
for or against amendments, and then 
did what is best for the country. Let’s 
do it. Let’s not be afraid to vote. 
I see my distinguished friend from 
Texas on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
thank my friend from Vermont for his 
courtesy. 
Yesterday, Texas reported almost 
7,000 new coronavirus cases, setting a 
new single-day record. 
As cases have climbed in recent 
weeks, it has become clear that we 
need to take what we have learned 
about this virus and adjust our strat-
egy. 
In the beginning, we were still learn-
ing about this novel virus and how it is 
transmitted, while also trying to maxi-
mize scarce resources. I think the best 
analogy I can think of—we were trying 
to design and build an airplane while 
we were flying it. 
Because of that, only individuals 
with symptoms or who had been in con-
tact with a person who had tested posi-
tive could be tested themselves, but we 
know a lot has changed in the last few 
months. We have learned that individ-
uals can have the virus even if they 
aren’t showing symptoms. 
Recent studies in North Carolina and 
New York have shown that somewhere 
between 12 and 20 percent of people 
could have the COVID–19 antibodies. In 
other words, they have had the virus, 
and they recovered, but they didn’t 
even know they were sick in the first 
place, but the problem is they can still 
spread it to others. 
As 
our 
knowledge 
about 
the 
coronavirus has increased, so have our 
testing capacities, but I think it is im-
portant to take stock of where we are 
and to see how we need to adjust fur-
ther to, again, what we have learned by 
hard experience. 
On Sunday, I traveled to Dallas, TX, 
with Vice President MIKE PENCE for a 
briefing on the coronavirus response ef-
forts, and we were joined by two of 
those members—Dr. Deborah Birx and 
HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson. 
On the flight down, I was able to 
spend some time talking with Dr. Birx 
about testing strategies and the ways 
we can more effectively identify posi-
tive cases and stop the spread, espe-
cially among asymptomatic individ-
uals who have no incentive, no motiva-
tion to request a test in the first place. 
If I am feeling well, why would I go ask 
for a coronavirus test unless I am just 
curious. That is the conundrum. 
Dr. Birx talked about the concept of 
pool testing, which is one of the most 
efficient ways to test large numbers of 
people using the least amount of time 
and resources. 
Let’s say, for example, that a number 
of employees at a meat packing plant 
are tested simultaneously. Rather than 
running each sample individually to 
see if any of the employees had the 
virus, you would pool the sample to-
gether and run it as a group. If the pool 
sample comes back negative, you know 
that each individual within that pool is 
negative. And if it comes back positive, 
each sample is run individually to 
identify positive cases. 
But this is a way to magnify the 
number of testing cases we can do by 
maybe as much as a factor of 10. 
This pool-testing model makes it 
much easier to conduct repeated tests 
for individuals in a single setting such 
as workplaces, schools, or nursing 
homes. 
This is exactly the kind of strategy 
we are going to need as we contemplate 
sending our children back to school. 
Dr. Birx was recently quoted as say-
ing: ‘‘If you look around the globe, the 
way people are doing a million tests or 
10 million tests is they’re doing pool-
ing.’’ 
So as we are seeing spikes in Texas 
and a number of other States across 
the country, it is clear we need to 
adapt to everything we have learned 
and embrace a new and different strat-
egy. We need more efficient and effec-
tive ways to test broad swaths of peo-
ple so we can identify positive cases as 
soon as possible. 
Now, we know this virus is particu-
larly deadly if you are over 80 years old 
or if you have underlying health prob-
lems. For the rest of us, honestly, if 
you get symptoms, you are probably 
going to recover. Sadly, some will have 
to be hospitalized, but, actually, the 
level of fatalities we have seen from 
the coronavirus infection have re-
mained remarkably low because our 
healthcare providers have discovered 
new treatments and new ways to save 
lives.

Peter Frazier has said about pool test-
ing that ‘‘if you don’t test people with-
out symptoms and focus only on symp-
tomatic people, then you miss the epi-
demic and continue spreading.’’ 
We need to constantly reevaluate and 
adapt our strategy to ensure that we 
are identifying cases as soon as pos-
sible to stop the spread and to protect 
the most vulnerable among us. 
I know the administration and the 
task force are working around the 
clock on this, but to be frank, we need 
to up our game, and I hope we will 
focus on developing a comprehensive 
testing strategy based on what we have 
learned from this hard experience to 
combat the rise in cases and commu-
nity spread we are seeing in places like 
Texas and elsewhere. 
S. 4049 
Madam President, this week, the 
Senate is fulfilling one of our most 
basic responsibilities—and that is to 
support our common defense. 
Passing the strong, strategic, and bi-
partisan national defense authorization 
bill is something we have done for the 
last 60 years. It is how this body has 
ensured that generations of service-
members would be paid, that they 
would have the equipment and training 
they need, as well as the weapons, the 
planes, and the ships to bring them 
home safely. It is how we have taken 
stock of the evolving threat landscape 
and made adjustments to ensure that 
our military remains the very best in 
the world. It is a belief in peace 
through strength. 
We know our adversaries are con-
stantly watching us to see whether we 
are hesitant or pulling back from our 
world leadership or maybe we are not 
investing like they are in modern 
weapons systems that can defeat our 
defenses. 
Well, we know for all the tech-
nologies and innovation that have 
made our lives simpler and more effi-
cient, that these changes in technology 
have made safeguarding our national 
security that much more challenging. 
We are seeing new technologies on 
the battlefield, and the race to develop 
next-generation 
weapons, 
such 
as 
hypersonic missiles, has allowed our 
competitors to get a few steps ahead of 
us. The bottom line is, unless we con-
tinue our investment and our deter-
mination to remain No. 1, we are going 
to be losing ground against our adver-
saries. We no longer enjoy the across- 
the-board strategic edge that we used 
to have, and it is time for us to take 
bold action to reverse the tide before it 
is too late. That is what I believe we 
can achieve with this year’s National 
Defense Authorization bill. 
I appreciate Chairman INHOFE
and 
the members of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, which operates al-
most entirely on a bipartisan basis. It 
really is a great tradition and one we 
don’t want to break, passing the De-
fense authorization bill each year. 
It also provides funding to both mod-
ernize and grow our aging fleet, so we 
can send our troops around the world 
with the confidence that they have the 
best equipment available. 
I’m glad this legislation includes a 
provision I offered to increase the num-
ber of new F–35 aircraft. When we talk 
about providing our servicemembers 
with the best possible equipment, the 
F–35 is a prime example. This 5th gen-
eration 
fighter 
gives 
our 
servicemembers an edge in stealth, sur-
veillance, and weapons systems. 
Growing our F–35 fleet has been a pri-
ority for a number of years, and this 
legislation will continue moving us in 
the right direction. These aircraft will 
be made by hardworking Texans in 
Fort 
Worth, 
and 
provide 
our 
servicemembers around the world with 
the most advanced and capable aircraft 
to see them through their missions. 
But maintaining a competitive edge 
requires much more than a fleet of top 
of the line aircraft or a stockpile of in-
novative weapons. It also requires end 
to end security in our supply chains. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has really 
shone a light on the vulnerabilities 
that come from a reliance on other 
countries for critical manufacturing. 
We lean heavily on China and other 
countries for masks, gloves, gowns, 
ventilators—all the equipment we’ve 
needed over the past few months. That 
reliance has led to a shortage of these 
supplies at the most critical time, and 
forced our medical workers to go into 
battle without their traditional armor. 
It’s been a wake-up call on supply 
chain vulnerabilities, and a reminder 
that we need to keep our most critical 
supply chains right here at home. One 
area where we need improvement is 
with 5G. For all the rewards that come 
with this advanced technology, there 
are also a lot of risks, and we need to 
ensure we’re protecting this critical 
asset. That’s why Senators BURR, WAR-
NER, and I introduced the Secure 5G 
and Beyond Act, which is now law. 
It requires the President to develop a 
strategy to ensure the security of next 
generation telecom systems, and help 
our allies protect their systems as well. 
But I believe we need to take this a 
step further, and safeguard not only 
the networks themselves but the sup-
ply chains that produce them. The re-
ality is, a lack of domestic industry 
has caused the U.S. to fall behind our 
foreign adversaries in developing 5G 
technologies. 
I’m glad the NDAA includes an 
amendment I offered to support these 
critical supply chains. It would give 
the Department of Defense the flexi-
bility to partner with industry for 
commercial development and deploy-
ment of 5G technologies. This will en-
sure we’re investing in American com-
panies to strengthen and secure our 
critical networks, which are vital not 
only to our national security, but to 
our everyday lives. 
Beyond supporting 5G, another crit-
ical supply chain we need to support is 
for semiconductors. 
These 
devices 
are 
everywhere— 
they’re the underlying technology in 
everything from our cell phones, to 
computers, to cell towers, to missile 
defense systems. Despite the pervasive-
ness of these devices in our everyday 
lives, we’re largely relying on other 
countries to manufacture them. Since 
2000, the U.S. has dropped from pro-
ducing roughly a quarter of the world’s 
semiconductors to only 12 percent. 
Meanwhile, China has gone from 
manufacturing zero chips to 16 percent 
of the world’s supply, and plans to in-
vest another $1.4 trillion in semicon-
ductor technologies. America has lost 
ground to global competitors, and un-
less the U.S. takes action, it’s esti-
mated that by 2030, 83 percent of global 
semiconductor manufacturing capacity 
will be in Asia. We need to bring back 
some of the talent that was first cre-
ated here in the U.S. 
0f course, that’s much easier said 
than done. Building a new foundry is a 
very expensive undertaking, and it’s 
going to require an investment from 
the federal government. 
That’s why Senator WARNER and I in-
troduced the CHIPS for America Act, 
and I hope we can include a version of 
this bill as an amendment to the 
NDAA. This would create a federal in-
centive program through the Depart-
ment of Commerce to encourage semi-
conductor manufacturing in the U.S. 
In short, this would help stimulate 
domestic 
advanced 
semiconductor 
manufacturing, and boost both our na-
tional security and global competitive-
ness. 
I mentioned, these devices are every-
where—military 
systems, 
tele-
communications, 
healthcare, 
agri-
culture, 
manufacturing. 
Virtually 
every industry stands to benefit from a 
more 
secure 
semiconductor 
supply 
chain and our economy would reap the 
benefits of bringing these manufac-
turing jobs back to the United States. 
This legislation would serve as a 
boon to both our national security and 
our economy, and I’m hoping it will be 
included as part of the NDAA. 
I’d like to once again thank Chair-
man INHOFE
and Ranking Member 
REED for upholding the now 60-year 
tradition of a bipartisan process to get 
this legislation over the finish line on 
time. 
I’m 
glad 
this 
legislation 
prioritizes advancements in the crit-
ical technologies that will modernize 
our national defense, and restore our 
competitive edge. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first 
of all, I would make a comment in re-
action to the comments of our good 
friend from Texas. What he says is 
true, and the American people are not 
aware—and I don’t say this critically 
of the previous administration—but 
during the Obama administration, his 
top priority was not really defense. He 
had his own agenda, and, consequently, 
we suffered at that time. 
In the last 5 years, which would have 
been from 2010 to 2015, he reduced the

funding of our military by 25 percent. 
What people don’t realize is, during 
that same timeframe, Russia increased 
theirs by 34 percent, and China in-
creased the funding of their military 
by 83 percent. That put us in a situa-
tion in which we have to do what we 
are doing, and that is why this and the 
last bills have been very important. 
We are still working on the National 
Defense Authorization Act. I consider 
it to be the most important bill of the 
year. I know my colleagues agree with 
me that this is very significant, and 
this is something that we know is 
eventually going to pass. This will be 
the 60th consecutive year. 
Our military is the best in the world. 
This week, with this bill, we are going 
to make sure it stays that way. The 
goal of having a strong military is de-
terrence—to make sure that we don’t 
have to use it—and to send a signal to 
our 
enemies 
that 
they 
can’t 
win 
against us. This is the message we need 
to send today, tomorrow, and forever. 
That is what the national defense 
strategy tells us. 
I don’t have the national defense 
strategy book here, but we have been 
adhering to it. It is a strategy that was 
put together a few years ago by 12 
Democrats, 12 Republicans, and all the 
experts in the field, and we have been 
using it as our model ever since. So we 
want to make sure that we have 
enough ships and planes and every-
thing in place. 
China and Russia have caught up in 
some areas, and I think it is important, 
as the Senator from Texas said about 
the hypersonic weapons, that we are 
talking about offensive and defensive 
weapons; we are talking about some-
thing that is state of the art. They ac-
tually are ahead of us right now, but 
with this bill we are going to get 
caught up. 
Our superiority rests on our staying 
ahead of our competition. We ceded 
that advantage under the last adminis-
tration, and we are going to correct 
that. That is where we are right now. 
I see the minority leader is here, and 
I would like to propose a unanimous 
consent request. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENTS 
EN BLOC 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that, at a time to be deter-
mined by the majority leader in con-
sultation with the Democratic leader, 
the following amendments be made 
pending en bloc and the Senate vote in 
relation to the amendments in the 
order listed without intervening action 
or debate: Paul amendment No. 2011; 
Sanders amendment No. 1790; third, 
Cornyn-Schumer-Cotton 
amendment 
No. 2244. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
the following amendments be called up 
en bloc and the Senate vote on adop-
tion of the amendments en bloc with 
no intervening action or debate. 
I hesitate to do this. It will take me 
a minute to actually name all of the 
amendments because it is important 
for our Members who are watching to 
be aware of where they stand in line. 
I ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing amendments be called up en 
bloc and the Senate vote on adoption of 
the amendments en bloc with no inter-
vening action or debate: Moran, No. 
1694; Hyde-Smith, No. 1881; Romney, 
No. 1883; Portman, No. 1891; Kennedy, 
No. 1987; Romney, No. 2018; Sullivan, 
No. 2391; Johnson, No. 2077; Wicker, No. 
2178, Fischer, No. 2231; Risch, No. 2238; 
Gardner, No. 2241; Portman, No. 2243; 
Inhofe-Reed, No. 2248; Peters, No. 1753; 
Warner, No. 1803; Coons, No. 1808; War-
ner, No. 1907; Tester, No. 1968; Bennet, 
No. 1977; Smith, No. 2058; Cortez Masto, 
No. 2186; King, No. 2215; Merkley, No. 
2251; Cantwell, No. 2255; Cantwell, No. 
2256; Hirono, No. 2269; Menendez, No. 
2270, and Peters, No. 2275. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object, while I know the committee 
is working hard and I know the Sen-
ator from Oklahoma and the Senator 
from Rhode Island are working hard to-
gether in a very good way, I know they 
have been trying to work up an agree-
ment on three amendments to come, as 
well as a managers’ package, but there 
are certain amendments that our side 
feels should be debated. 
In a moment I will ask the chairman 
to modify his request to include rea-
sonable numbers of amendments that 
we believe should have rollcall votes. 
None of these are ‘‘gotcha’’ amend-
ments. None of these are extraneous. 
They are not dealing with impeach-
ment or the records of the President or 
anything like that. Every one of them 
is related to the NDAA bill, and there 
is sincere feeling on our side that these 
amendments should be debated and 
voted on. 
This is not an attempt to block or 
obstruct; this is an attempt to come 
together. As we know, to make this 
work, we need bipartisan agreement. 
All of them, as I said, are related to the 
NDAA bill. 
The modification I am asking for also 
includes the two Republican amend-
ments, one from Senator CORNYN and 
one from Senator PAUL. 
I appreciate the chairman’s desire to 
start voting on these amendments, but 
I hope he will modify his request so 
that several more Members of the Sen-
ate on both sides of the aisle can 
amend the bill as well, and we can 
move forward. 
So I ask this question of my friend 
the chairman: Will the Senator modify 
his request to include the following 
amendments to be called up and voted 
on in relation to Sanders No. 1788, in 
lieu of Sanders amendment No. 1790— 
that is the 10 percent cut to the Pen-
tagon; Tester No. 1972 on Agent Or-
ange; Shaheen No. 1729 on the PFAS 
study; 
Gillibrand 
No. 
1755 
on 
transgender policy; Manchin No. 2361 
on NNSA; Menendez No. 2396 on the 
Bounty Act; Van Hollen-Rubio No. 1845 
on the DETER Act; and Schatz-Mur-
kowski No. 2252 on the section 1033 pro-
gram? 
I ask the Senator to modify his re-
quest to add those amendments, and 
then Members on our side who have se-
rious concerns can have their amend-
ments considered. 
Mr. INHOFE. First of all, let me re-
spond by saying that this has been a 
long process, and it is one that has in-
volved leadership on both sides, and we 
are attempting to do that. I think that 
by looking at the list I have read off, 
the Senator will see a lot of Democrats 
and a lot of Republicans there. For 
that reason I think we have an ade-
quate number that several of us have 
agreed on, so I would object to modi-
fication of my amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object, I hope we can continue these 
discussions in a productive and fruitful 
way, but at this point I must object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
to speak about the disturbing reporting 
regarding Russian efforts to harm 
Americans 
in 
Afghanistan 
through 
payments to the Taliban and the 
Haqqani network. This is deadly seri-
ous and we—the Congress and the 
American public—must get answers to 
a number of questions. 
When did the United States first re-
ceive information suggesting that Rus-
sia was providing financial support to 
Taliban or HQN operatives to kill 
American troops? 
What investigation has been done by 
DOD or intel agencies to corroborate 
the charge? 
What investigations have been done 
into the deaths of U.S. troops in Af-
ghanistan during the relevant time pe-
riod to determine whether they might 
be linked to Russian payments? 
Was information about this allega-
tion contained in the President’s daily 
briefing in late February? If so, why 
are the President and the White House 
maintaining so strongly that the Presi-
dent was never briefed? 
When did the United States first brief 
allies—specifically, the United King-
dom—on the intelligence concerning 
the Russian bounty allegations? 
What events led to an administrative 
interagency meeting on this topic in 
late March? 
What options were explored at that 
meeting? Were any undertaken? 
To the extent that there is a dif-
ference of opinion about the existence 
of such a program among U.S. agen-
cies, what explains the differing con-
clusions? 
Did President Trump discuss the 
matter in any of the numerous phone

calls he had with Russian President 
Putin from late March through this 
month? 
If the President knew of the concern, 
why did he persist in trying to get Rus-
sia invited as a participant to the G7 
meeting to be held in the United States 
this fall? 
Why hasn’t the President condemned 
the existence of any such program or 
at least pledged that there would be se-
rious consequences if such a program 
existed? 
That Russia might behave in a hos-
tile manner toward U.S. troops in Af-
ghanistan would not be a surprise 
based upon Russia’s track record of bad 
behavior all over the globe, but what 
has been surprising has been the ad-
ministration’s actions regarding this 
explosive allegation, and I believe the 
Senate must get to the bottom of it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
since last week, the Senate—ostensibly 
one of the great deliberative bodies in 
the world—supposedly has been ‘‘debat-
ing’’ the $740 billion National Defense 
Authorization Act. It has been a very, 
very silent debate because of the 700 
amendments that have been filed to 
this bill. There have been no rollcall 
votes on any of them. I do understand 
that in the managers’ amendment, 
some of the noncontroversial, non-
significant amendments have been ac-
cepted and absorbed, and that is fine. 
We have had a vigorous debate, but no-
body in the world has heard that de-
bate because there has not been one 
amendment here on the floor. 
Knowing the way the Senate does 
business, I worry very much—and I 
hope I am wrong, and I will do my best 
to prevent it, but I worry very much 
that we are supposed to be getting out 
of here for the Fourth of July break to-
morrow night. Right now, it is a little 
after 2 p.m. on Wednesday, and we are 
out of here on Thursday. 
Given the fact that we are talking 
about 53 percent of the discretionary 
budget of the U.S.A., I am just a little 
bit worried about how many real 
amendments, significant amendments, 
are going to be offered. 
Let us be clear that over the last 
year, we have been part of what I con-
sider to be the biggest do-nothing Sen-
ate in the modern history of this coun-
try. This country faces enormous crises 
in terms of the pandemic, faces enor-
mous crises in terms of an economic 
meltdown, enormous crises in terms of 
racial injustice and police brutality, 
enormous crises in terms of being the 
only major country on Earth not to 
guarantee healthcare to all people as a 
human right, and enormous crises that 
in Siberia last week, the temperature 
was 100 degrees, which is frightening 
the scientific community because they 
understand this is the tip of the iceberg 
regarding climate change. We have all 
these crises out there, and nothing 
much happens here in the Senate. 
Well, I think maybe it might be a 
good idea to start some real debate 
right here. I have introduced six 
amendments that are significant. I will 
discuss each of them. Other Members, 
Democrats and Republicans, have also 
introduced significant amendments. 
Given the fact we have done virtually 
nothing over the last year, I think it is 
not inappropriate to have some serious 
debate on one of the very major pieces 
of legislation we will be dealing with. 
We are talking about a bill that will 
spend some $740 billion. That is more 
money in terms of military spending 
than the next 11 nations combined. 
Does anybody have a problem with 
that? Some of us do. Maybe others 
don’t. Let’s debate it. 
We are talking about a bill that will 
be spending more money on the Pen-
tagon than we did during the height of 
the Cold War and the height of the 
wars in Vietnam and Korea. Does any-
one have a problem with that? Well, I 
do. Maybe some other people do. Maybe 
you don’t. Tell me why you think we 
should be spending more money on the 
military today in terms of inflation 
than we did during the war in Vietnam. 
Let’s debate it. 
We are talking about a bill that will 
provide 53 percent of the entire discre-
tionary budget to the bloat and waste-
ful Pentagon at a time when the De-
fense Department cannot even pass an 
independent audit. We have a huge 
budget for the Pentagon. They cannot 
pass an independent audit, and the re-
sponse of the Senate is, well, let’s give 
them even more money. It may make 
sense to some people. It doesn’t make 
sense to me. 
In my view, it would be rather dis-
graceful for us to leave town, recess 
the Senate for 2 weeks without getting 
a vote on a single amendment and then 
come back in a couple of weeks to pass 
a $740 billion Defense bill without any 
opportunity to amend that bill. 
If the horrific pandemic that we are 
now experiencing, where tens of thou-
sands of people are coming down with 
the virus every single day—if the pan-
demic has taught us anything, it is 
that national security, the well-being 
of our people, and protecting our peo-
ple is a lot more than just building 
bombs and missiles and jet fighters and 
tanks and submarines. Our people are 
in trouble today in an unprecedented 
way with the pandemic and with an 
economic meltdown in which tens of 
millions of people have lost their jobs 
over the last couple of months. We 
have to focus on how we protect those 
people. It is not just spending money 
on planes and guns and bombs. 
In order to begin the process of ad-
dressing some of the most important 
issues facing our country, I have intro-
duced five amendments, all of which I 
think are important and all of which I 
believe need to have a vote and a de-
bate. Let me very briefly explain what 
those amendments are and what they 
would do. 
The first amendment would reduce 
the military budget by 10 percent and 
use that $74 billion in savings to invest 
in distressed communities in every 
State in this country that have been 
ravaged by extreme poverty, mass in-
carceration, deindustrialization, and 
decades of neglect. 
It is no secret to anybody that the 
American people are hurting all across 
this country. We have communities 
where unemployment today is 20, 25, 30 
percent, where people are sleeping out 
on the streets, where schools are un-
derfunded, 
where 
decent-quality 
childcare is virtually not available, 
and where air and water pollution is 
rampant. It is time that we stop turn-
ing our backs on those communities. 
What we are doing right now is focus-
ing attention on the fact that 40 mil-
lion Americans are living in poverty. 
Half of our people are living paycheck 
to paycheck. And maybe—just maybe— 
instead of investing more money in nu-
clear weapons and submarines and God 
knows what else, maybe we want to in-
vest in our own people, in jobs and 
healthcare and education, so that they 
can live their lives with dignity and se-
curity. 
I believe right now, in the midst of 
all of the crises this country faces—the 
crisis of the pandemic, the crisis of the 
economic meltdown, the crisis of racial 
injustice, the crisis of 100 million peo-
ple being uninsured or underinsured, 
the crisis of climate change—I think 
the American people want real trans-
formation. They are tired of the status 
quo. They want a government that rep-
resents all of us, not the 1 percent and 
wealthy campaign contributors. 
I do understand that the people be-
hind this military budget who love it 
so much are the military-industrial 
complex and the defense contractors. 
They are doing phenomenally well. It 
is a great budget for them. Their CEOs 
make tens of millions of dollars a year. 
They make huge profits every single 
year. It is a good budget for them. But 
maybe we may want to get our prior-
ities right and have a good budget for 
working families and low-income fami-
lies in America. That is what my 
amendment does. 
This amendment is being cosponsored 
by Senators MARKEY and WARREN. It is 
also being supported by over 60 organi-
zations throughout this country rep-
resenting millions and millions of peo-
ple, including organizations like Public 
Citizen, Union of Concerned Scientists, 
Physicians for Social Responsibility, 
and the Coalition on Human Needs. 
These organizations are saying that 
maybe—just maybe—instead of invest-
ing in weapons of destruction, instead

of spending more money on the mili-
tary than the next 11 nations com-
bined, maybe we should invest in our 
people. 
What this amendment would do is 
provide funding, again, for 1,000 dis-
tressed communities, from Vermont to 
Oklahoma, which would receive Fed-
eral funding to hire more public school 
teachers, provide nutritious meals to 
children and parents, and offer free tui-
tion to public colleges, universities, or 
trade schools. 
At this pivotal moment in American 
history, we have to make a funda-
mental decision that we want to con-
tinue spending billions on endless wars 
in the Middle East, on weapons of mass 
destruction—of which we have more 
than enough—or do we provide decent 
jobs and education and healthcare for 
millions of people in our country? 
Further, a major reason why there is 
so much waste, fraud, and abuse at the 
Pentagon is, in fact, that the Defense 
Department remains the only Federal 
agency in America that hasn’t been 
able to pass an independent audit, 
which deals with the second amend-
ment that I have introduced. 
I don’t think it is too much to say 
that the largest agency of the Federal 
Government has to pass an inde-
pendent audit. 
There is nobody in the Senate who 
does not believe there is massive waste 
and fraud at the Pentagon. Defense 
contractor after defense contractor has 
pled guilty to fraud. We have massive 
cost overruns. 
In the second amendment that I am 
offering, which has been cosponsored 
by Senator GRASSLEY, a longtime Re-
publican leader here; Senator LEE, a 
Republican from Utah; and Senator 
WYDEN, of Oregon, all that we are ask-
ing is that there be an independent 
audit of the Defense Department and 
that it be completed no later than fis-
cal year 2025. It is not a very radical 
idea. 
The third amendment I am offering is 
one that, I would hope and expect, 
would have wide support right here. I 
think it does have support among the 
American people, and it certainly has 
widespread support among the medical 
community and the epidemiologists of 
this country. 
Just yesterday, I was participating in 
a hearing of the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. We 
had the leading experts in this country, 
including several representatives of the 
Trump administration—Dr. Fauci and 
others—talking about the pandemic 
and what we could do about it. There 
was widespread consensus. Nobody, I 
think, has any doubt anymore, except 
maybe Donald Trump, that masks are 
a very, very important preventive 
measure. They are not going to solve 
all of the problems, but the evidence is 
overwhelming that the people who 
wear masks in public, when they are 
around other people, are less likely to 
transmit the virus or to receive the 
virus. Nobody doubts that anymore. 
So the question that we have to ask 
ourselves is this: How does it happen 
that, in the wealthiest country in the 
history of the world and with the 
strongest economy in the world, we 
have doctors and nurses today who are 
dealing with people with COVID–19 and 
don’t even have the personal protective 
equipment that they need? How in 
God’s name does that happen? 
We are spending 18 percent of our 
GDP on healthcare—twice as much as 
any other country. Yet we cannot pro-
vide a $1 mask to a doctor or to a nurse 
whose life is at stake. It is not only 
doctors and nurses. 
What a number of countries around 
the world are doing, which is very 
smart, is producing or acquiring large 
numbers of high-quality masks, and 
they are distributing those masks to 
all of the households in their countries. 
We should be making sure that every 
household in this country has the 
masks that each needs. That will save 
lives. There is an estimate from the 
University of Washington that it could 
save 30,000 lives during this pandemic if 
95 percent of the American people were 
to wear masks. It would also save us a 
substantial sum of money because it is 
a lot cheaper to invest in masks than 
in the hospitalizations for those who 
have the virus. I should mention that 
other countries that are not as wealthy 
as we are—countries like South Korea, 
France, Turkey, Austria, and others— 
are doing just that. 
Again, this is an idea that has won 
support from not only Dr. Fauci but 
from other leading healthcare experts 
who testified before the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions yesterday. That is the third 
amendment—making sure that we uti-
lize the Defense Production Act to 
produce the masks that our medical 
professionals and the American people 
need. We can save tens of thousands of 
lives and hundreds of billions of dollars 
by doing it. 
The fourth amendment I have filed 
would prohibit funding for military aid 
and logistical support for the disas-
trous, Saudi-led war in Yemen. I be-
lieve it is past time that we put an end 
to our unconstitutional and unauthor-
ized participation in this war. 
On this issue, I am certainly not 
alone. A bipartisan majority of the 
U.S. Senate has already voted three 
times—not once, not twice, but three 
times—to halt all U.S. military sup-
port for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. It 
is time for us to do that again—this 
time, not just in words but in action. 
We should have no money going toward 
U.S. participation in this horrible war, 
which is destroying a nation with some 
of the poorest, most desperate people 
on Earth. 
So that is the fourth amendment, 
and I think it would be hard for any-
body here to deny that it is an impor-
tant amendment. This has already 
been, in one form or another, passed 
three times. So let’s get some teeth 
into it. 
The last amendment that I have filed 
would reduce the defense budget by 
one-tenth of 1 percent—not a lot of 
money—and use that money to make 
our Nation safer by reaching out to 
people throughout the world and ex-
panding educational and cultural ex-
change programs. 
In other words, the theory behind 
this whole bill is that, by spending $740 
billion on the building of planes and 
tanks and guns and the most sophisti-
cated weapons of mass destruction in 
the history of the world, it will make 
us safer. Well, I am not so sure. Maybe 
what makes us safer is when we break 
down the fears and the hatred that 
exist between peoples all over the 
world. Maybe what makes us safer is 
when we get to know each other—that 
is, as human beings—whether we are 
Chinese or Russians or Iranians or Bra-
zilians or Canadians. Maybe we all 
share the same human aspirations. 
Throughout history, it has always 
been easy to demonize people you don’t 
know—always 
easy. 
That 
is 
what 
demagogues have always done. We are 
fearful of Jews, of Blacks, of the Irish, 
of Italians, and of gay people. It is so 
easy to demonize people with whom we 
are not comfortable and don’t know. 
They are not in our communities, and 
we don’t know anybody. Let’s demon-
ize the people of Iran, and let’s demon-
ize the people of China and Russia. 
This is not saying that I or anybody 
else here is in agreement with their 
policies, but are weapons the only ap-
proach we have toward them? Yes, we 
need a strong military, and I believe in 
a strong military. Do you know what I 
also believe? When we have kids from 
the United States who go to other 
countries and when other countries 
send their kids, their farmers, their 
doctors, their nurses to America and 
when we get to know each other, we 
have a shot at breaking down the irra-
tional hatred which foments so many 
problems throughout the world. 
As a former mayor, I can tell you— 
and I am not alone—that this idea of 
sister cities is certainly not a radical 
idea. I suspect that almost everybody 
here in the Senate comes from a State 
in which a sister city program exists or 
that you have programs with cities in 
other countries. In Vermont, we have a 
number of them. I started several of 
them when I was the mayor of Bur-
lington. It was a beautiful thing to 
see—kids from another country coming 
to our country and our people going to 
other countries and learning. 
All I am asking for is one-tenth of 1 
percent—$7 billion—no, less than that. 
What am I talking about? All I am ask-
ing for is $700 million to encourage cul-
tural and educational exchange pro-
grams. By taking this tiny fraction 
from our defense budget—one-tenth of 
1 percent—and applying it to these ex-
change programs, we will send a mes-
sage about the critical role these ex-
change programs play. They exist all 
over this country already, but I want 
to see them grow, in supporting not

only American security but our com-
mon, global security. Therefore, I have 
listed and described five amendments. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to set aside the pending amend-
ment and call up the following amend-
ments en bloc: Senate amendment Nos. 
1788, 1920, 1789, 1919, and 1918; that they 
be reported by number; further, that 
there be 2 hours of debate on the 
amendments, equally divided and con-
trolled by me or by my designee and by 
Senator INHOFE or his designee; and 
that, following the use or yielding back 
of that time, the Senate vote on the 
adoption of the amendments, in the 
order listed, without intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
ROUNDS). Is there objection? 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I object; 
although, I would like to have the op-
portunity to look at all five of these 
amendments to see which ones would 
not be consistent with the negotiation 
that is taking place right now. 
I would like to make sure that every-
one understands that, at this very mo-
ment, Democrats and Republicans are 
looking at a lot of amendments, as we 
have done every year for 60 years, to 
make sure that we are getting the 
right amendments in order to make the 
bill the best we can. 
Now, it will just take a few minutes 
for me to do this. Until then, I reserve 
the right to object. If we have a timing 
problem on this, I will object, but it 
might be that there is one I would like 
to consider at this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would 
like to be recognized in order to make 
a comment. 
First of all, I have great respect for 
the Senator. I have worked with him 
many times, and we have really gotten 
quite a bit accomplished. I know that 
my friend is sincere in the statements 
that he makes, but I find myself in a 
different position. 
I see what has happened in previous 
administrations, and, during the last 5 
years of the Obama administration, I 
saw when, in his budget, the President 
reduced the military by 25 percent at 
the same time that China was increas-
ing its by 83 percent and Russia was in-
creasing its by 34 percent. I am sen-
sitive to this, and it is one of the con-
siderations we make. 
I do object to this amendment, but I 
am going to work with the Senator to 
see which of these might be appro-
priate and can be sellable to a majority 
of the people in the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Sen-
ator INHOFE is right. He and I have 
known each other for years and, I 
think, respect each other. We have 
very, 
very 
different 
philosophical 
leanings, but that does not mean we 
cannot respect each other. 
All I would say to my friend from 
Oklahoma is that the function of the 
Senate is for 100 Members to determine 
what is important, not just a few. What 
may not be important to me may be 
important to you, and what may be im-
portant to you may not be important 
to me. Yet I think, especially on a bill 
of this significance, the Members— 
Democrats and Republicans—have a 
right to come forward and bring forth 
amendments. If I don’t like an amend-
ment and you have brought forth the 
amendment, it is likely I am going to 
vote against it, and you are going to 
vote against my amendment. I get it. 
It is called democracy. It is the process 
we go through here. I just cannot un-
derstand why we are not voting on 
amendments. When we get back, I 
would rather see a process take place 
whereby dozens of amendments are 
brought up and debated and voted up or 
voted down. That is what, I think, this 
Senate is supposed to stand for. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the 
Senator would yield for one more com-
ment so I may address that, Senator 
REED and I are both in agreement. We 
have been wanting amendments. We 
have been asking on a daily basis—now 
for about 2 months—for Members to 
bring their amendments down so we 
can consider amendments. We are in 
the process now of seeing which amend-
ments we are able to bring up that we 
might have reached an agreement on. 
We are doing that. It is not an easy 
process, and it does take a little bit of 
time. Yet I am hopeful that we will 
have amendments. I anticipate we will. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if I 
may respond to my friend, JACK REED 
is a good friend of mine, and I know 
that you and he are working hard and 
well together. Yet you are two Sen-
ators, and there are 98 others of us, and 
on what you two may agree to be im-
portant or not to be important others 
may disagree. 
All I am saying to the Senator is to 
let people bring up their amendments. 
If the Senator doesn’t like it and I 
don’t like it, we will vote against it. I 
just don’t know why we are restricting 
amendments in a Senate which is sup-
posed to be one of the great delibera-
tive bodies in the world. The world is 
supposed to look at us, but they are 
not looking well at us when a few peo-
ple determine what is going to be voted 
on or not. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would 
respond by saying that I don’t take 
issue with that, but I will say that we 
all remember what happened a year 
ago when this bill was up. One of our 
Members objected to all amendments 
coming up, and, as a result, no one got 
an amendment up. 
That isn’t happening this year be-
cause the individuals who were opposed 
to amendments last year are no longer 
opposed to amendments. We are just 
trying to—with the understanding and 
the realization that things are done in 
the Senate with unanimous consent 
and that one person has a lot of power 
to stop a lot of other people, we don’t 
want that to happen. We want to en-
courage amendments, and we are going 
to try to consider as many as we can. 
Mr. SANDERS. I would simply say to 
my friend, he is quite right—unani-
mous consent gives every Member a lot 
of power, and I do not want to be objec-
tionable, but I feel very strongly on 
this issue, and I hope we can work on 
something. 
Mr. INHOFE. Thank you. 
Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
S. 4049 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to continue this de-
bate about the Armed Services bill we 
are considering on the floor today, and 
I would just note for my colleagues 
that I know that it is a general prac-
tice, but my colleague from Vermont is 
bringing up a very big, important point 
about amendments, and that is that 
the NDAA is marked up in a secret, 
closed-door session. It is not like we all 
have a bright light, and we know what 
is in there. In fact, they held the lan-
guage for 3 weeks and then now, all of 
a sudden, thrust it onto the Senate 
floor and then don’t want us to offer 
any amendments. 
In my case, I am objecting, along 
with the Senator from Vermont, as to 
a major shift in policy that is in this 
proposal that shifts money away from 
the Department of Energy and onto nu-
clear weapons, where we didn’t even 
vote on it. We didn’t vote on it, and 
members of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee are in disagree-
ment about this, the fact that we 
weren’t consulted and that it is basi-
cally raiding jurisdiction. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
letter signed by myself, Senator LAMAR 
ALEXANDER, Senator HEINRICH, Senator 
CASSIDY, Senator WYDEN, Senator BAR-
RASSO, Senator RISCH, and Senator 
SANDERS from Vermont. 
We object. We are members of the 
committee. We are very senior mem-
bers of the committee. We understand 
the DOE budget. We understand the 
DOE responsibilities. We don’t think it 
is right for somebody to mark up, in a 
closed-door session, in the middle of 
the National Defense Act, a taking of 
money, basically neutering the Sec-
retary of Energy, basically saying: You 
only have half of your budget because 
we are going to dictate over at the De-
partment of Defense exactly how you 
are going to spend those dollars. 
So that is a big power grab by a very 
few people and certainly deserves a 
vote by the U.S. Senate. It certainly 
deserves a bright light by the Amer-
ican people because not only are we 
talking about this from the perspective 
of the taking away DOE resources and

focus from the Secretary of Energy, we 
are also talking about putting into the 
hands of the Department of Defense 
what has been civilian oversight—civil-
ian oversight of the production of our 
nuclear weapons. 
So why is this so important, who is 
in charge of DOE’s budget? Well, I 
think the Secretary of Energy is. I 
think he comes before Congress. I 
think he discusses with Congress what 
that budget is. I think he talks and we 
talk and we review his nominees and 
the work they do on this. 
For me, in the State of Washington, 
we have the largest nuclear cleanup 
site in the entire world. So cleaning up 
Hanford from the plutonium produc-
tion that was done for our efforts in 
World War II is a massive, multibil-
lion-dollar-a-year cleanup. I wish it 
wasn’t that much, but it is, and it has 
been for decades. 
And people constantly look at that $2 
billion and think: We can shave some 
of those dollars off. I am here to tell 
you, you can’t, not with leaky tanks 
leaking into the groundwater and mov-
ing toward the Columbia River—no. We 
cannot have people taking half of the 
DOE budget and then basically decid-
ing that the Department of Defense is 
going to decide what to do with it. 
Hanford isn’t the only site. There are 
other cleanup sites—Paducah. There 
are still things to do with Savannah 
River. There are cleanup sites all over 
the United States. 
To, in the NDAA bill, basically, pre-
clude us from even discussing such a 
major policy change that is not sup-
ported by the Secretary of Energy, not 
supported by the chairwoman of the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee or the ranking member, Senator 
MANCHIN, whose amendment we would 
like to seek a vote on—so I submit to 
the RECORD this letter from my col-
leagues on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee also objecting to 
this language. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
UNITED STATES SENATE, 
Washington, DC, July 1, 2020. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. JIM INHOFE, 
Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. JACK REED, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIRMAN INHOFE, 
AND RANKING MEMBER REED: As the Senate 
considers the Fiscal Year 2021 National De-
fense Authorization Act (NDAA), we write to 
express our opposition to the inclusion of 
controversial and far reaching provisions 
that would fundamentally alter the Depart-
ment of Energy’s (DOE) responsibilities for 
the nuclear weapons budget. 
As members of the Senate Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources, we write in 
support of Secretary Brouillette’s June 29, 
2020 letter to Chairman Inhofe and share his 
concerns that provisions in the Senate 
NDAA bill undermine DOE’s ability to meet 
its mission goals and responsibility for main-
taining the viability of the nation’s nuclear 
deterrent. 
As currently written, the Senate NDAA 
bill would strip the Secretary of Energy of 
the ability to manage some of the most sen-
sitive national security programs that ac-
count for almost half of the Department’s 
budget. Such changes could impede account-
ability and Congressional oversight, as well 
as imperil future funding for other critical 
DOE responsibilities such as promoting sci-
entific and technological innovation, man-
aging our National Laboratories, sponsoring 
basic research in the physical sciences, and 
ensuring cleanup of the nation’s nuclear 
weapons complex. 
Sweeping changes impacting civilian con-
trol of our nation’s nuclear weapons pro-
grams should only be made in consultation 
and coordination with the committee of ju-
risdiction in an open and transparent man-
ner. The changes included in the Senate 
NDAA bill have been met with opposition 
from the Trump Administration, former Sec-
retaries of Energy, recent NNSA Administra-
tors, and the Congressional Advisory Panel 
on the Governance of the Nuclear Security 
Enterprise. 
We therefore request that the provisions be 
removed from the pending bill or that the 
Senate be allowed to vote on the relevant 
amendments 
filed 
by 
Ranking 
Member 
Manchin. 
Sincerely, 
MARIA CANTWELL, MARTIN HEINRICH, RON 
WYDEN, MAZIE K. HIRONO, BERNIE SAND-
ERS, LAMAR ALEXANDER, BILL CASSIDY, 
JOHN BARRASSO, JAMES RISCH. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, what 
else is at stake? 
Also, at stake are our National Lab-
oratories. Our National Laboratories 
do incredibly hard work for us. I know 
what ours does in the Pacific North-
west because they are an expert on cy-
bersecurity. They are an expert on de-
tection. They are an expert on ter-
rorism and fighting terrorism. 
So now, all of a sudden, you are going 
to let the National Nuclear Security 
Agency decide what that budget looks 
like because they are going to take 
more money from it. 
Now is not the time to allow the De-
partment of Defense, without our over-
sight that we are sent here to give, to 
decide what this budget should look 
like. That is not their role and respon-
sibility. 
So the fact that somebody thinks 
they can stick this in, in a closed-door 
session, and then jam us, without a 
vote of this body to consider such a 
major policy change, is appalling. 
Now, I know that people tried to do 
this 2 years ago or a year and a half 
ago and basically got taken out by the 
House of Representatives, but that is 
no excuse for doing it now. People jam 
so many things into this bill. Last 
time, they jammed in basically the re-
licensing of a hydroelectric dam. Basi-
cally, written into this for the chair-
man was the revision that said they no 
longer have to be regulated by the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Well, I can tell you, there are lots of 
people in the State of Washington who 
would probably love to know that the 
hydro system didn’t have to go through 
FERC relicensing, but they did have to 
go through FERC relicensing. 
And so the fact that that was in a 
panoply of things stuffed into NDAA, 
in the final negotiation in the House, 
they couldn’t get it out. So we are 
being held hostage one more time on 
the NDAA bill for bad policy that has 
not had the broad discussion of the 
U.S. Senate. 
So I would say to my colleagues: If 
you care about nuclear waste cleanup, 
if you care about the agenda of our na-
tional laboratories—and I will tell you, 
you think people are threatening you 
right now? People are threatening us 
on cybersecurity. People don’t stick a 
sub into your waters anymore, taunt-
ing you or flying aircraft overhead; 
they basically put software tools into 
your powerplants, into your military 
sites. We need our National Labora-
tories to do their job, not have the 
money subverted by some agency that 
we don’t see, they don’t come to us— 
they go to a few Members. They go to 
the Senator from Oklahoma, but they 
don’t come see us and talk about their 
agenda. They basically just want an in-
crease, and instead of going through 
the normal legislative process, they ba-
sically are trying to short circuit both 
appropriators and authorizers on this 
important issue. 
So if people are proud of that lan-
guage, if they think it stands, they 
think it is the right policy, then they 
should let us have a vote. They should 
let us have a discussion of who is in 
charge of DOE’s budget because, I guar-
antee you, most Americans think it is 
the Secretary of Energy and not a 
five-, seven-member subcabinet level 
over at DOD. 
This is appalling, and it has to stop. 
TRIBUTE TO JOEL CONNELLY 
Mr. President, if I could, while I am 
out here on the floor, pay tribute to 
one of the most iconic newspapers in 
the State of Washington, the Seattle P- 
I, and one of its noted journalists who 
is retiring this week after 47 years 
writing for the organization. 
This newspaper, which was part of 
the Northwest history for decades, fi-
nally stopped the print edition several 
years ago, but it has still been online. 
Joel Connelly has been an icon of the 
Northwest, writing about Presidents 
for decades; writing about Northwest 
policy, such as the outdoors; writing 
about 
the 
relationship, 
on 
inter-
national issues, particularly with Can-
ada. 
Joel said it best. Once he said about 
his employer, the P-I: ‘‘We do our best 
to inform you, to intrigue you, amuse 
you, and at times get under your skin.’’ 
I miss those days of journalism 
today, where someone has so much 
knowledge and information about our 
region, about politics in general, about 
society that they help keep us in-
formed and engaged.

S4102 
July 1, 2020 
Joel once interviewed Bill Clinton on 
Air Force One and obviously inter-
viewed many Presidents—both Bushes, 
Clinton, Obama. 
He once was a Pulitzer Prize runner- 
up for his coverage of the Washington 
Public Power Supply System, and obvi-
ously he covered Hanford issues, which 
I just talked about many times, and 
many northern border issues. 
He probably was best known in his 
coverage 
of 
Idaho 
Governor 
Cecil 
Andrus and wrote a book about him 
and the many fights that happened in 
the Northwest on land issues for many, 
many years. 
So I can’t even begin to explain what 
it will be like without Joel Connelly at 
the helm of political national com-
mentary for us in the Pacific North-
west. 
Nobody sharper. Nobody keener. No-
body more experienced. Nobody who 
struck more fear in me when I had to 
get on the phone with him because 
chances were he knew the issue even 
better than I did, and I had been pretty 
studied on it, but that is what you get 
after 47 years in journalism. 
So I wish him all the best, but I also 
hope his retirement is a call for all of 
us to remember how important jour-
nalism really is; that the tool and 
trade of people who basically cover 
these policies, understand them, and 
help give commentary in their columns 
or in their journalism and oversight is 
what helps us keep our democracy here 
in the United States. 
So, Joel, I know you will be up there 
on Whidbey Island and you will be 
watching us from afar. I know we are 
not done hearing the last of you, but I 
know we have heard a great com-
mentary for 47 years of the P-I and 
your comments, and we greatly appre-
ciate it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today the United States, Mexico, and 
Canada launched a new chapter in our 
historic partnership with entry into 
force of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agree-
ment—USMCA for short. 
Thanks to the decisive leadership of 
President Trump, the USMCA will open 
the door for robust economic growth. 
At the same time, regarding his deci-
sive leadership as President, this isn’t 
an issue just now. This is something 
the President said in 2016; that the 
NAFTA was the worst trade agreement 
that we have had, and he was going to 
get rid of it or revise it. Most Presi-
dents run on a platform. They may not 
serve on that platform. This President 
is serving on that platform, and today 
the USMCA going into force for the 
first time is absolute proof of this 
President keeping his promises and 
getting the job done. 
He also needs to compliment and 
thank Ambassador Lighthizer, the ne-
gotiator on this whole agreement. 
The USMCA brings to bear, then, a 
trilateral trade agreement that will 
lift prosperity across North America. 
The USMCA paves the way for freer 
markets and fairer trade. It replaces 
NAFTA and puts America in a better 
position to expand market access for 
U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses. 
Specifically, the USMCA modernizes 
rules of origin for autos, sanitary and 
phytosanitary standards, intellectual 
property rules, digital trade, financial 
services, customs, labor, environment, 
and more. 
Some of these issues I just mentioned 
weren’t even around 30 years ago when 
NAFTA was negotiated. Modernizing 
NAFTA into the 21st century was the 
right thing to do. 
As we enter into this agreement, the 
world is navigating uncertain times, as 
we know. The unprecedented public 
health crisis has turned the economy 
upside down. Now, more than ever, our 
farmers, businesses, and workers need 
and deserve certainty that they can 
count on us to turn things around and 
accelerate economic recovery. 
As chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee, 
with 
jurisdiction 
over 
trade, I will be keeping a close eye on 
the implementation of this historic 
trade agreement. I want to ensure that 
any kinks that come up are ironed out 
with appropriate flexibility, taking 
into 
consideration 
unforeseen 
cir-
cumstances from the pandemic, such as 
automakers and others who were shut 
down 
or 
repurposed 
operations 
to 
produce medical equipment, and that is 
just one example. I also will keep 
watch to hold accountable all stake-
holders and ensure full compliance 
with the trade agreement. 
Now more than ever, North America 
must work together to harvest the 
fruits of the USMCA. That is how we 
can foster investment, innovation, and 
job creation for the 478 million people 
who live in these 3 countries. 
The U.S. International Trade Com-
mission estimated that the USMCA 
within 5 years would raise U.S. GDP by 
$68 billion, forecasting 176,000 new jobs 
in the United States. That is music to 
the ears for everyone in America who 
has been hard hit by the pandemic’s 
economic fallout. 
Farmers in my State have enjoyed 
one of the best planting seasons in dec-
ades. However, our livestock, poultry, 
and biofuels producers have faced cata-
strophic disruption to their operations 
since the virus swept across the coun-
try. Iowa is the Nation’s No. 1 producer 
of pork, eggs, and corn. Our economy 
depends on exports to grow and for our 
economy to flourish. 
American farmers depend on exports 
to pay their bills and earn a living. 
Farmers simply want to grow and 
produce for the marketplace, not for 
government bailouts. 
Today’s inauguration of the USMCA 
offers a bright ray of hope for North 
America to plow forward and to plant 
the seeds for a robust economic recov-
ery. 
With every trade issue that comes, it 
is always important to remember what 
President Kennedy said in his Presi-
dency about trade legislation and the 
benefits of it—that if it benefits one 
country, it benefits the others. He said 
that ‘‘a rising tide lifts all boats.’’ 
I am confident the USMCA will steer 
America’s workers, farmers, and busi-
nesses to better days ahead. 
I yield the floor.

f 
NATIONAL BORINQUENEERS DAY 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to recognize and honor a 
very important group of people in our 
Nation’s history. The 65th Infantry 
Regiment of the U.S. Army known as 
the Borinqueneers was comprised of 
U.S. citizens from Puerto Rico. 
The 
Borinqueneers 
courageously 
fought for decades to defend the free-
doms we enjoy today. They answered 
the Nation’s call to serve, and they are 
the longest standing and only Active- 
Duty Latino military unit in U.S. his-
tory. 
On April 13, 2016, Congress awarded 
the Congressional Gold Medal to the 
65th Infantry Regiment in recognition 
of the Borinqueneers’ numerous con-
tributions to American history and 
outstanding 
military 
service 
from 
World War I to the recent conflicts in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Today, I am honored to join my col-
leagues in recognizing the bravery, 
service, and sacrifice of the Puerto 
Rican soldiers of the 65th Infantry 
Regiment and to express deep gratitude 
for the contributions to the Armed 
Forces that have been made by hun-
dreds of thousands of patriotic U.S. 
citizens from Puerto Rico. 
I am honored to designate April 13 as 
National Borinqueneers Day to ensure 
their legacy lives on. History will for-
ever pay tribute to the sacrifices these 
individuals and their families made to 
defend our freedom. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to address the Senate in Spanish. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(The English translation of the state-
ment made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. It is my honor 
to recognize the service of these brave 
American citizens from Puerto Rico 
who fought for our Nation. Your legacy 
will live on. Thank you for your serv-
ice. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res. 641, submitted 
earlier today.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows:

OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, Amer-
icans are demanding an end to the per-
sistent racial injustice and violence 
that inflicts our country. 
Protestors have gathered outside of 
the White House and the Capitol. New 
Mexicans from our biggest city to our 
smallest communities are marching for 
meaningful change. 
I have joined these protests in Eman-
cipation Hall, in the streets of Wash-
ington, DC, and now I am joining them 
from the U.S. Senate floor. 
The systemic racism being called out 
is real, and it is all around us all of the 
time. Within law enforcement, we have 
seen it in the horrific videos docu-
menting the racist violence that took 
the lives of Black men and women at 
the 
hands 
of 
police 
officers 
and 
extrajudicial killers. 
As a father raising two sons, my 
heart aches for the parents whose sons’ 
and daughters’ names we now chant 
loudly in the streets. 
It is unacceptable for any American 
to live in fear of violent encounters 
when they enter public spaces or retail 
stores or just go out for a walk. The 
very fact that painful experiences with 
law enforcement are ubiquitous among 
so many in our Nation should be evi-
dence enough that our current model of 
policing is not working. That is why I 
am proud to support my colleagues 
Senator BOOKER and Senator HARRIS to 
cosponsor the Justice in Policing Act. 
This sweeping legislation reforms the 
police system as Americans across the 
country demand an end to police vio-
lence that is disproportionately tar-
geting communities of color. It would 
address qualified immunity standards 
in Federal law which currently stand 
in the way of police officers being held 
accountable in court when they violate 
constitutional rights. 
It would improve transparency in po-
lice departments by creating a national 
police misconduct registry, requiring 
accurate data reporting on misconduct 
and use-of-force incidents and ensuring 
problematic officers cannot avoid ac-
countability by simply changing de-
partments. 
It would also institute a real na-
tional ban on choke holds and other 
deadly, restrictive airway holds. We 
have seen this use of lethal force kill 
George Floyd and Eric Garner before 
him and earlier this year, in Las 
Cruces, NM, when a police officer 
killed Antonio Valenzuela with a vas-
cular neck restraint. While I hope that 
justice will be served for Mr. Floyd’s 
and Mr. Valenzuela’s families, I know 
that these men should never have died 
in the first place. This lethal and un-
necessary type of force should not be 
allowed anywhere in America. 
The Justice in Policing Act would 
put an end to the injudicious use of no- 
knock warrants that led to the murder 
of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, KY. 
In 
order 
to 
prevent 
future 
extrajudicial killings like the murder 
of Ahmaud Arbery earlier this year by 
vigilantes in Georgia, the Justice in 
Policing Act would also finally des-
ignate lynching as a Federal crime. 
The legislation would also make 
broad improvements in training for po-
lice officers. That includes implicit 
bias training to confront the prejudice 
that contributes to racial profiling and 
confrontational treatment of people of 
color. 
We must also make deescalation and 
crisis intervention techniques standard 
operating procedures in encounters and 
make the use of lethal force the abso-
lute last resort. 
In my State, we have seen far too 
many incidents in which police have 
killed people of color with lethal tac-
tics or responded to New Mexicans ex-
periencing mental illness or addiction 
with unnecessary force that resulted in 
death. Nearly a decade ago, the Depart-
ment of Justice began an investigation 
into the Albuquerque Police Depart-
ment after numerous such fatal police 
encounters. 
In 2014, the Department of Justice re-
leased its report that cited chronic 
abuses of civil rights, widespread com-
munity distrust, and a pattern of ex-
cessive force across the department. 
For these past 6 years, the Albu-
querque Police Department has been 
under a federally enforced consent de-
cree that has brought much needed 
changes in hiring, training, and use-of- 
force policies. 
This ongoing process of changing just 
this one police department’s culture is 
far from complete. Court hearings con-
tinue, and a federally appointed mon-
itor continues to oversee the yearslong 
process of completing all of the re-
forms in the federally mandated, court- 
approved settlement agreement. 
We have still seen multiple fatal po-
lice shootings each year since reforms 
began. That includes one case from just 
this March in which the response to a 
welfare 
check 
on 
Valente 
Acosta- 
Bustillos, a man with documented be-
havioral health challenges, ended with 
officers fatally shooting him after he 
wielded a shovel that he had been using 
to do yard work. 
This is not an isolated incident. The 
evidence is everywhere that systemic 
reform is needed for law enforcement, 
not just in Albuquerque but all across 
my State and all across this country. 
Since the beginning of 2015, since the 
Nation reeled over the death of Mi-
chael Brown in Ferguson, MO, there 
have been more than 5,000—5,000—fatal 
police shootings. It pains me to say 
that in that time period, New Mexico 
has had the highest rate of these shoot-
ings in the entire country on a per cap-
ita basis. 
While our overall nationwide statis-
tics on deaths in police custody are in-
complete—which is a problem in and of 
itself—the data we do have makes it 
clear that police in the United States 
are killing people at a rate much high-
er than our peer nations. 
A review of media-reported, arrest- 
related deaths in the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics found that more than 1,300 
people died in police custody in the 10 
months from June 2015 to March 2016. 
During that same period, only 13 people 
in the United Kingdom died in or after 
being in police custody. 
While we are a much larger country, 
even on a per capita basis, that means 
that Americans are being killed at a 
rate of approximately six times higher 
than in the UK. Many, if not most, of 
these deaths fall or are deemed ‘‘justi-
fied’’ by law enforcement, but I want to 
say in the strongest possible terms: We 
can’t keep accepting a system that jus-
tifies this level of deadly violence. 
The House of Representatives dem-
onstrated last week that we can take 
action to address this system. Answer-
ing the calls of Americans all across 
our country, the House voted to pass 
the Justice in Policing Act. The Senate 
needs to do the same because no one 
should be above the law—no one, in-
cluding those in law enforcement. 
While I believe these last weeks and 
months of Americans calling for jus-
tice have changed many hearts and 
minds, I am not naive enough to be-
lieve the current administration is ei-
ther willing or capable of bringing the 
level of change that Americans are de-
manding. 
Unfortunately, in the last 31⁄2 years, 
President Trump and his Justice De-
partment have either turned a blind 
eye, excused, or even openly encour-
aged a more violent police culture. 
Starting under Attorney General Jeff 
Sessions 
and 
certainly 
continuing 
under 
Attorney 
General 
Bill 
Barr 
today, this administration has spent 
much more time and Department of 
Justice resources aiding the Presi-
dent’s own political battles and imple-
menting even harsher penalties on 
Americans than on holding police de-
partments 
accountable 
for 
guaran-
teeing equal justice under the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4104 
July 1, 2020 
None of this excuses us in the U.S. 
Senate from our own responsibility to 
lead. We have a moral obligation, as 
Senators, to grapple with how we can 
bring about necessary Federal changes 
with better Federal policies. That 
should start with passing the account-
ability measures, the meaningful im-
provements to police training, and the 
bans on excessive lethal force tactics 
that are in the Justice in Policing Act. 
We 
also 
need 
to 
encourage 
the 
changes that will necessarily need to 
come at the local government level. 
Advocates are calling on local govern-
ments to reassess their budgets and 
how much they have prioritized polic-
ing and prisons over education and 
housing. They are also calling on their 
local leaders to reimagine a world 
where armed police officers are not the 
responders dispatched to all crisis situ-
ations. 
Last week, the mayor of Albu-
querque, Tim Keller, announced a pro-
posal to create an entirely new public 
safety department that would dispatch 
social workers, housing and homeless-
ness specialists, and violence preven-
tion and diversion program experts in-
stead of police officers to homeless-
ness, so-called down-and-out calls, and 
behavioral health crises. 
This is the scale of systemic change 
that we need to be thinking about and 
devoting real resources toward imple-
menting in all of our communities. We 
all need to carefully assess the effec-
tiveness of continuing a status quo in 
law enforcement that is clearly not 
keeping all of us safe. 
It will not be easy to dismantle the 
‘‘us versus them’’ warrior mentality 
that is so pervasive in far too many of 
our law enforcement agencies. If you 
treat the communities that you police 
like they are war zones, you create a 
relationship that dehumanizes the very 
people you are charged to protect, and 
you fuel more of the very violence and 
crime that you are supposed to pre-
vent. 
Our streets in American communities 
should never be treated like battle-
fields. Our local law enforcement offi-
cers should not be armed with mili-
tary-grade equipment or AR–15s or 
MRAP armored vehicles. They should 
not be meeting peaceful protesters or 
demonstrators with teargas, flash gre-
nades, or rubber bullets. Police officers 
should not be treating any of us—what-
ever our race and regardless of the rea-
son we are encountering them—as if we 
are enemy combatants. 
This militarized version of policing is 
simply not the way to keep the peace 
or create a sense of public safety in our 
communities. It has created a distrust 
in police and perpetuated trauma and 
inequities in communities across our 
country. 
I believe that we must transform this 
dangerous warrior mentality into a 
guardian and neighborhood support 
mentality that looks to serve all mem-
bers of our communities. We should re-
member that police officers are sup-
posed to be officers of the peace. 
Now, I want to be careful to empha-
size that the responsibility for chang-
ing this mentality must not fall en-
tirely on the shoulders of our law en-
forcement officers because we also rec-
ognize that our law enforcement offi-
cers, too, are being impacted and 
harmed by this broken system. We, as 
a society, have asked them to treat the 
symptoms and respond to the defi-
ciencies that all of us have allowed to 
persist in education, in healthcare, in 
addiction treatment, and in housing. 
On a daily basis, police officers ad-
dress the most acute impacts of our 
not solving those other issues. I would 
argue that this is because the same 
wrongheaded ‘‘us versus them’’ warrior 
mentality that I have been describing 
has long resided within this very insti-
tution and has been baked into our 
country as a whole. 
It is the same warrior mentality that 
has fueled the Federal Government’s 
ineffective and racist War on Drugs and 
War on Crime over the course of the 
last 50 years. Intentionally or not, 
these policies helped build what advo-
cates label the ‘‘school-to-prison pipe-
line’’ and the ‘‘New Jim Crow.’’ ‘‘New 
Jim Crow’’ may sound harsh, but in my 
estimation, it is an astonishingly accu-
rate way to describe the unequal soci-
ety we have created across our entire 
country. 
More than half a century since the 
marchers in the civil rights movement 
called on us to create an America 
where we were all judged by the con-
tent of our character rather than the 
color of our skin, we find ourselves fac-
ing the same challenges as 50 years 
ago, with implicit bias and structural 
inequities ravaging our communities of 
color. That is what you get after com-
bining militarized policing with overly 
harsh sentencing laws, mass incarcer-
ation, private prisons, continued insti-
tutional racial discrimination, and a 
decades-long disinvestment in public 
education, affordable housing, food as-
sistance, 
addiction 
treatment, 
and 
healthcare resources. 
That is the system we are talking 
about when we talk about systemic 
racism. It will take more than nice 
words and kind wishes in a fleeting pe-
riod of weeks to dismantle that system 
that has been built up in the 400 years 
since the first slaves were brought to 
our shores and in the last 50 years of 
rapidly growing mass incarceration. 
The sooner we finally recognize this, 
the sooner we can try to envision and 
implement effective, comprehensive re-
forms on the scale necessary to create 
institutions that look out for all of us. 
Over the last months, as we have all 
confronted the health and economic 
crises brought on by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, I have often heard that we need 
to get back to normal. But that version 
of normal was not working for all of us. 
Rather than hoping to get back to 
that unequal and unjust normal of be-
fore, I would offer this challenge to all 
of us. We have an opportunity—an op-
portunity to rebuild our country in the 
months and years ahead. Let’s rebuild 
our country to create an America that 
includes all of us. Let’s rebuild our 
country in a way that respects the 
human dignity of Black lives and pro-
vides safety and opportunity to all of 
us. Let’s rebuild America to become 
the place we all want it to be: a nation 
where we see each other as fellow 
human beings, equally deserving of life 
and liberty. 
There is still so much more hard 
work ahead of us. Passing the Justice 
in Policing Act is a first meaningful 
step on a long path forward. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mrs. BLACKBURN. I ask unanimous

FREE SPEECH 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
over the past few months, we have all 
watched the power that the digital 
community has to make someone’s 
passing thought go viral and the power 
that the digital mob has to make con-
troversial voices completely disappear. 
Well, who is the ‘‘digital mob’’ ex-
actly, because right now we are hear-
ing a lot about mob rule. Sometimes it 
is hard to tell who the mob actually is. 
Is it the millions of users who swarm 
social media platforms at the very first 
hint of a controversy, or is it the pro-
fessional activists who provoke many 
of these attacks? They seem to know 
just when to pitch a thought, a word, 
or an idea. Could it be the platforms 
themselves that cave to the pressure 
and police speech when they don’t 
agree with that speech? 
So let’s drill down on this just a lit-
tle bit. Today I want to focus on the 
Googles and the Facebooks of the 
world because, when it comes down to 
it, they are the ones that are in the 
driver’s seat. They are the ones that 
end up calling the shots. 
For 
years, 
tech 
companies 
have 
waged a very public war against plat-
form users who speak out against the 
popular narrative, and the executives 
charged with defending these calls rou-
tinely struggle to explain the arbitrary 
nature of their content-moderation 
policies. 
Every time moderators remove a post 
for what is called shocking content or 
cause a moral panic by placing a warn-
ing label on satire, Big Tech asks us to 
just, oh, write it off: It was a mistake. 
We really didn’t mean to do it. Move 
on. 
But we haven’t moved on because the 
platforms themselves have provided 
plenty of evidence to confirm that Big 
Tech’s employees bring their bias to 
the workplace. Bear in mind, all of 
these employees who are developing 
the search models—the algorithms that 
are prioritizing your search, that are 
mining your data, that are policing

your speech—are bringing their bias 
and their prejudice to the workplace. 
These fears were confirmed back in 
2017 when the New York Times re-
ported that a Twitter employee inten-
tionally—intentionally—deleted Presi-
dent Trump’s account, not because of 
any violation but because the employee 
had an ax to grind. They did not like 
President Donald Trump. 
This May, the Wall Street Journal 
revealed 
that 
Facebook 
set 
up 
a 
multistep approval process for changes 
to its ‘‘integrity ranking initiative’’ 
due to ‘‘reasonable concerns that over-
zealous engineers might let their poli-
tics influence the platform.’’ 
Think about that. Facebook set up a 
multistep approval process for changes 
to its integrity ranking initiative due 
to 
reasonable 
concerns 
that 
over-
zealous engineers might let their poli-
tics influence the platform. Do you 
think? Of course they were. Of course 
they were. The problem: They have 
been doing it all along and trying to 
say it is just your imagination when, 
actually, it is not. 
I don’t think anyone anticipated that 
digital platforms would become power-
ful enough to act as judge and jury 
over 
what 
information 
Americans 
should be allowed to access online. 
Congress certainly didn’t anticipate it 
when drafting legislation to keep those 
companies in check. But they have 
overstepped their bounds. They con-
tinue to misbehave until we come 
along and slap their hand, and then 
they try to act as if they are going to 
solve their problems, which leads us to 
our current debate over section 230 re-
form. 
Big Tech relies on section 230 of the 
Communications Decency Act to shield 
themselves from content-based litiga-
tion. The statute also acts as a sword 
that platforms can engage to remove 
content they judge to be obscene, vio-
lent, harassing, or otherwise objection-
able. 
In the section 230 world, then, the 
users—the users—are responsible for 
what they post, not the platform that 
hosts the content. 
The platforms, however, have the 
right to set their own content guide-
lines within limits without being sued. 
That sounds reasonable. Section 230 is 
important, 
specifically, 
because 
of 
what it doesn’t do. It does not force 
companies to choose between moder-
ating every piece of content they host 
and letting their websites turn into the 
Wild West. 
But, as I said, no legislation could 
have anticipated our current digital 
landscape. Big Tech companies like 
Google and Facebook now have the 
power to ruin content creators who 
step out of line. And it is their line. 
Even if those creators manage to stay 
on the right side of the moderators, 
they know their online presence—and 
many times this is also their liveli-
hood—lives or dies at the hands of em-
ployees given the near-impossible task 
of remaining completely neutral 100 
percent of the time. The dynamic be-
tween users and platforms has changed. 
And now, Congress must change the 
law that guides that dynamic. 
Here is the problem. This country 
has become so polarized, I am not sure 
Big Tech understands what a healthy 
dynamic would actually look like. No 
longer do their choices seem to make 
sense to many Americans. The compul-
sion to flag and report and threaten 
has become a reflex. When the digital 
mob chooses to attack on any given 
day, then, their choices are going to 
change with every news cycle. As we 
have seen, this heavily influences how 
Big Tech chooses to police content on 
their platforms. 
You may have been saying or posting 
something for years—no problem. But 
then one day, that digital mob—be-
cause of the news cycle—will choose to 
attack you. 
Conservatives have suffered under 
this mob rule. There is no denying it. 
There is no denying that there is a dig-
ital mob. But reform can happen with-
out overextending the heavy hand of 
Federal regulation over the entire tech 
industry. As someone who knows what 
it feels like to be censored, I get it. I 
absolutely understand why we need 
these reforms and why Congress needs 
to act now, this year. But I also know 
that the more you rely on threats to 
motivate good corporate behavior, the 
more likely you will be to find reasons 
to follow through on them. 
We must find stronger ways to rein 
in tech firms seeking to become the 
new speech police. We know for a fact 
that Big Tech’s biases are the problem. 
But when did more government become 
the solution? We already tried that ap-
proach. We called it the fairness doc-
trine. Guess what. It did not work. In-
stead of encouraging free and fair dis-
course, powerful parties use those rigid 
standards 
as 
leverage 
to 
control 
speech. 
And, I will tell you, I can think of 
few things more dangerous than allow-
ing lawmakers and bureaucrats to 
weaponize the full force of the Federal 
Government against the private ex-
change of information. 
What we do know is this. Big Tech’s 
era of self-regulation is over. It no 
longer works. Big Tech is not a group 
of infant companies. They are referred 
to as Big Tech because they have 
grown. 
This self-regulation is over. It is time 
for Congress to take an action. But pu-
nitive, one-size-fits-all standards will 
put these tech companies in a strait-
jacket. It would hamper innovation, 
and, eventually, it would collapse the 
industry. 
Instead, we should set up and give 
Big Tech guidance that will encourage 
growth and will encourage innovation, 
while also making it abundantly clear 
that Congress will not allow Big Tech’s 
political bias to determine what infor-
mation Americans are allowed to ac-
cess online. We will not allow Big Tech 
and their political bias to determine 
how information is prioritized through 
your search engine. We are not going 
to allow Big Tech and their political 
bias to data-mine every email, every

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-

There being no objection, the mate-

ROGUE TWITTER EMPLOYEE BRIEFLY SHUTS 
DOWN TRUMP’S ACCOUNT 
(By Maggie Astor) 
This is the way the world ends: not with a 
bang but a deleted Twitter account. 
At least, so it appeared for 11 minutes 
Thursday evening, when visitors to Presi-
dent 
Trump’s 
personal 
account, 
@realDonaldTrump, 
were 
informed 
that 
there was no such thing. 
The error message on some devices was 
even more dire: ‘‘@realDonaldTrump does 
not exist.’’ 
Amid a presidency that has seemed, at 
times, to be conducted primarily in 140-char-
acter pieces, this was a seismic event—and 
what was left of Twitter erupted. It was a 
raucous, modern-day town-square gathering 
of the sort not seen since . . . well, since five 
months ago, when Mr. Trump coined a new 
word in the middle of the night. 
It was just before 7 p.m. Thursday, and the 
internet was in an uproar. Time stopped. The 
sun rose in the west and set in the east. 
What, the watchers wondered, was going on? 
Had Twitter closed the president’s account? 
Had a White House aide snatched the phone 
from Mr. Trump’s tweeting hands? Had Rob-
ert Mueller chosen this moment to rifle 
through the president’s direct messages? Had 
Mr. Trump himself—could it be?—decided 
he’d had enough of his favorite medium? 
The answer, revealed three hours later, 
was 
something 
straight 
out 
of 
‘‘Office 
Space.’’ After saying in an initial statement 
that the account had been ‘‘inadvertently de-
activated due to human error by a Twitter 
employee,’’ Twitter announced that a rogue 
customer support worker had done it on his 
or her last day at the company. 
Many of Mr. Trump’s supporters were in-
censed, with some saying the incident 
showed a disregard for free speech. His oppo-
nents, on the other hand, were gleeful. 
‘‘America: Hire this person,’’ former Rep-
resentative 
John 
Dingell 
of 
Michigan 
tweeted. 
Even before Twitter confirmed that the de-
activation had been deliberate, some were 
speculating about it. 
In the tech world, the statement raised 
more questions than it answered. Twitter 
has never said how many employees have ac-
cess to Mr. Trump’s account, or described 
the safeguards it has in place for its highest- 
profile users. And the company is already 
under the microscope in Washington, where 
Congress is investigating how technology gi-
ants might have shaped the outcome of the 
2016 presidential election. 
Mr. Trump was locked out for just 11 min-
utes, and then, just as suddenly, he was 
back. Those watching found themselves un-
scathed—though some could not quite shake 
a sense of dread. 
The president himself got back to business 
as if nothing had happened, tweeting at 8:05 
p.m.: ‘‘Great Tax Cut rollout today. The lob-
byists are storming Capital Hill, but the Re-
publicans will hold strong and do what is

right for America!’’ He then fired off four 
more tweets, denouncing the Democratic Na-
tional Committee and James B. Comey be-
fore inviting viewers to watch his interview 
with Laura Ingraham on Fox News. 
And so, back in the offices and homes of 
the nation, the people of Twitter could only 
sit back and reflect. 
For better or for worse, the world seemed 
predictable again, and one user made his pre-
diction bold. ‘‘Man,’’ Alex Zalben wrote, ‘‘in 
like nine months there’s gonna be a ton of 
Trump Twitter blackout babies.’’

FACEBOOK EXECUTIVES SHUT DOWN EFFORTS 
TO MAKE THE SITE LESS DIVISIVE 
(By Jeff Horwitz and Deepa Seetharaman) 
A Facebook Inc. FB 0.35% team had a blunt 
message for senior executives. The com-
pany’s algorithms weren’t bringing people 
together. They were driving people apart. 
‘‘Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s 
attraction to divisiveness,’’ read a slide from 
a 2018 presentation. ‘‘If left unchecked,’’ it 
warned, Facebook would feed users ‘‘more 
and more divisive content in an effort to 
gain user attention & increase time on the 
platform.’’ 
That presentation went to the heart of a 
question dogging Facebook almost since its 
founding: Does its platform aggravate polar-
ization and tribal behavior? 
The answer it found, in some cases, was 
yes. 
Facebook had kicked off an internal effort 
to understand how its platform shaped user 
behavior and how the company might ad-
dress potential harms. Chief Executive Mark 
Zuckerberg had in public and private ex-
pressed concern about ‘‘sensationalism and 
polarization.’’ 
But in the end, Facebook’s interest was 
fleeting. Mr. Zuckerberg and other senior ex-
ecutives largely shelved the basic research, 
according to previously unreported internal 
documents and people familiar with the ef-
fort, and weakened or blocked efforts to 
apply its conclusions to Facebook products. 
Facebook policy chief Joel Kaplan, who 
played a central role in vetting—proposed 
changes, argued at the time that efforts to 
make conversations on the platform more 
civil were ‘‘paternalistic,’’ said people famil-
iar with his comments. 
Another concern, they and others said, was 
that some proposed changes would have dis-
proportionately affected conservative users 
and publishers, at a time when the company 
faced accusations from the right of political 
bias. 
Facebook revealed few details about the ef-
fort and has divulged little about what be-
came of it. In 2020, the questions the effort 
sought to address are even more acute, as a 
charged presidential election looms and 
Facebook has been a conduit for conspiracy 
theories and partisan sparring about the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
In essence, Facebook is under fire for mak-
ing the world more divided. Many of its own 
experts appeared to agree—and to believe 
Facebook could mitigate many of the prob-
lems. The company chose not to. 
Mr. Kaplan in a recent interview said he 
and other executives had approved certain 
changes meant to improve civic discussion. 
In other cases where proposals were blocked, 
he said, he was trying to ‘‘instill some dis-
cipline, rigor and responsibility into the 
process’’ as he vetted the effectiveness and 
potential 
unintended 
consequences 
of 
changes to how the platform operated. 
Internally, the vetting process earned a 
nickname: ‘‘Eat Your Veggies.’’ 
Americans were drifting apart on funda-
mental societal issues well before the cre-
ation of social media, decades of Pew Re-
search Center surveys have shown. But 60% 
of Americans think the country’s biggest 
tech companies are helping further divide 
the country, while only 11% believe they are 
uniting it, according to a Gallup-Knight sur-
vey in March. 
At Facebook, ‘‘There was this soul-search-
ing period after 2016 that seemed to me this 
period of really sincere, ‘Oh man, what if we 
really did mess up the world?’ ’’ said Eli 
Pariser, co-director of Civic Signals, a 
project that aims to build healthier digital 
spaces, and who has spoken to Facebook offi-
cials about polarization. 
Mr. Pariser said that started to change 
after March 2018, when Facebook got in hot 
water 
after 
disclosing 
that 
Cambridge 
Analytica, the political-analytics startup, 
improperly obtained Facebook data about 
tens of millions of people. The shift has 
gained momentum since, he said: ‘‘The inter-
nal pendulum swung really hard to ‘the 
media hates us no matter what we do, so 
let’s just batten down the hatches.’ ’’ 
In a sign of how far the company has 
moved, Mr. Zuckerberg in January said he 
would stand up ‘‘against those who say that 
new types of communities forming on social 
media are dividing us.’’ People who have 
heard him speak privately said he argues so-
cial media bears little responsibility for po-
larization. 
He argues the platform is in fact a guard-
ian of free speech, even when the content is 
objectionable—a 
position 
that 
drove 
Facebook’s decision not to fact-check polit-
ical advertising ahead of the 2020 election. 
INTEGRITY TEAMS 
Facebook launched its research on divisive 
content and behavior at a moment when it 
was grappling with whether its mission to 
‘‘connect the world’’ was good for society. 
Fixing the polarization problem would be 
difficult, requiring Facebook to rethink 
some of its core products. Most notably, the 
project forced Facebook to consider how it 
prioritized ‘‘user engagement’’—a metric in-
volving time spent, likes, shares and com-
ments that for years had been the lodestar of 
its system. 
Championed by Chris Cox, Facebook’s 
chief product officer at the time and a top 
deputy to Mr. Zuckerberg, the work was car-
ried out over much of 2017 and 2018 by engi-
neers and researchers assigned to a cross-ju-
risdictional task force dubbed ‘‘Common 
Ground’’ and employees in newly created 
‘‘Integrity Teams’’ embedded around the 
company. 
Even before the teams’ 2017 creation, 
Facebook researchers had found signs of 
trouble. A 2016 presentation that names as 
author a Facebook researcher and sociolo-
gist, Monica Lee, found extremist content 
thriving in more than one-third of large Ger-
man 
political 
groups 
on 
the 
platform. 
Swamped with racist, conspiracy-minded and 
pro-Russian content, the groups were dis-
proportionately influenced by a subset of hy-
peractive users, the presentation notes. Most 
of them were private or secret. 
The high number of extremist groups was 
concerning, the presentation says. Worse was 
Facebook’s realization that its algorithms 
were responsible for their growth. The 2016 
presentation states that ‘‘64% of all extrem-
ist group joins are due to our recommenda-
tion tools’’ and that most of the activity 
came from the platform’s ‘‘Groups You 
Should Join’’ and ‘‘Discover’’ algorithms: 
‘‘Our recommendation systems grow the 
problem.’’ 
Ms. Lee, who remains at Facebook, didn’t 
respond to inquiries. Facebook declined to 
respond to questions about how it addressed 
the problem in the presentation, which other 
employees said weren’t unique to Germany 
or the Groups product. In a presentation at 
an international security conference in Feb-
ruary, Mr. Zuckerberg said the company 
tries not to recommend groups that break its 
rules or are polarizing. 
‘‘We’ve learned a lot since 2016 and are not 
the same company today,’’ a Facebook 
spokeswoman said. ‘‘We’ve built a robust in-
tegrity team, strengthened our policies and 
practices to limit harmful content, and used 
research to understand our platform’s im-
pact on society so we continue to improve.’’ 
Facebook in February announced $2 million 
in funding for independent research pro-
posals on polarization. 
The Common Ground team sought to tack-
le the polarization problem directly, said 
people familiar with the team. Data sci-
entists involved with the effort found some 
interest groups—often hobby-based groups 
with no explicit ideological alignment— 
brought people from different backgrounds 
together constructively. Other groups ap-
peared to incubate impulses to fight, spread 
falsehoods or demonize a population of out-
siders. 
In keeping with Facebook’s commitment 
to neutrality, the teams decided Facebook 
shouldn’t police people’s opinions, stop con-
flict on the platform, or prevent people from 
forming communities. The vilification of 
one’s opponents was the problem, according 
to one internal document from the team. 
‘‘We’re explicitly not going to build prod-
ucts that attempt to change people’s be-
liefs,’’ one 2018 document states. ‘‘We’re fo-
cused on products that increase empathy, 
understanding, and humanization of the 
‘other side.’ ’’ 
HOT-BUTTON ISSUES 
One proposal sought to salvage conversa-
tions in groups derailed by hot-button issues, 
according to the people familiar with the 
team and internal documents. If two mem-
bers of a Facebook group devoted to par-
enting fought about vaccinations, the mod-
erators could establish a temporary sub-
group to host the argument or limit the fre-
quency of posting on the topic to avoid a 
public flame war. 
Another idea, documents show, was to 
tweak recommendation algorithms to sug-
gest a wider range of Facebook groups than 
people would ordinarily encounter. 
Building these features and combating po-
larization might come at a cost of lower en-
gagement, the Common Ground team warned 
in a mid–2018 document, describing some of 
its own proposals as ‘‘antigrowth’’ and re-
quiring Facebook to ‘‘take a moral stance.’’ 
Taking action would require Facebook to 
form partnerships with academics and non-
profits to give credibility to changes affect-
ing public conversation, the document says. 
This was becoming difficult as the company 
slogged through controversies after the 2016 
presidential election. 
‘‘People don’t trust us,’’ said a presen-
tation created in the summer of 2018. 
The engineers and data scientists on 
Facebook’s Integrity Teams—chief among 
them, scientists who worked on newsfeed, 
the stream of posts and photos that greet 
users when they visit Facebook—arrived at 
the polarization problem indirectly, accord-
ing to people familiar with the teams. Asked 
to combat fake news, spam, clickbait and 
inauthentic users, the employees looked for 
ways to diminish the reach of such ills. One 
early discovery: Bad behavior came dis-
proportionately 
from 
a 
small 
pool 
of 
hyperpartisan users. 
A second finding in the U.S. saw a larger 
infrastructure of accounts and publishers on 
the far right than on the far left. Outside ob-
servers were documenting the same phe-
nomenon. The gap meant even seemingly

apolitical actions such as reducing the 
spread of clickbait headlines—along the lines 
of ‘‘You Won’t Believe What Happened 
Next’’—affected conservative speech more 
than liberal content in aggregate. 
That was a tough sell to Mr. Kaplan, said 
people who heard him discuss Common 
Ground and Integrity proposals. A former 
deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush, Mr. 
Kaplan became more involved in content- 
ranking 
decisions 
after 
2016 
allegations 
Facebook had suppressed trending news sto-
ries from conservative outlets. An internal 
review didn’t substantiate the claims of bias, 
Facebook’s 
then-general 
counsel 
Colin 
Stretch told Congress, but the damage to 
Facebook’s reputation among conservatives 
had been done. 
Every significant new integrity-ranking 
initiative had to seek the approval of not 
just engineering managers but also rep-
resentatives of the public policy, legal, mar-
keting and public-relations departments. 
Lindsey Shepard, a former Facebook prod-
uct-marketing director who helped set up 
the Eat Your Veggies process, said it arose 
from what she believed were reasonable con-
cerns that overzealous engineers might let 
their politics influence the platform. 
‘‘Engineers that were used to having au-
tonomy maybe over-rotated a bit’’ after the 
2016 election to address Facebook’s perceived 
flaws, she said. The meetings helped keep 
that in check. ‘‘At the end of the day, if we 
didn’t reach consensus, we’d frame up the 
different points of view, and then they’d be 
raised up to Mark.’’ 
SCUTTLED PROJECTS 
Disapproval from Mr. Kaplan’s team or 
Facebook’s 
communications 
department 
could scuttle a project, said people familiar 
with the effort. Negative policy-team re-
views killed efforts to build a classification 
system for hyperpolarized content. Likewise, 
the Eat Your Veggies process shut down ef-
forts to suppress clickbait about politics 
more than on other topics. 
Initiatives that survived were often weak-
ened. Mr. Cox wooed Carlos Gomez Uribe, 
former head of Netflix Inc.’s recommenda-
tion system, to lead the newsfeed Integrity 
Team in January 2017. Within a few months, 
Mr. Uribe began pushing to reduce the 
outsize impact hyperactive users had. 
Under 
Facebook’s 
engagement-based 
metrics, a user who likes, shares or com-
ments on 1,500 pieces of content has more in-
fluence on the platform and its algorithms 
than one who interacts with just 15 posts, al-
lowing ‘‘super-sharers’’ to drown out less-ac-
tive users. Accounts with hyperactive en-
gagement were far more partisan on average 
than normal Facebook users, and they were 
more likely to behave suspiciously, some-
times appearing on the platform as much as 
20 hours a day and engaging in spam-like be-
havior. The behavior suggested some were ei-
ther people working in shifts or bots. 
One proposal Mr. Uribe’s team cham-
pioned, called ‘‘Sparing Sharing,’’ would 
have reduced the spread of content dis-
proportionately 
favored 
by 
hyperactive 
users, according to people familiar with it. 
Its effects would be heaviest on content fa-
vored by users on the far right and left. Mid-
dle-of-the road users would gain influence. 
Mr. Uribe called it ‘‘the happy face,’’ said 
some of the people. Facebook’s data sci-
entists believed it could bolster the plat-
form’s defenses against spam and coordi-
nated manipulation efforts of the sort Russia 
undertook during the 2016 election. 
Mr. Kaplan and other senior Facebook ex-
ecutives pushed back on the grounds it 
might harm a hypothetical Girl Scout troop, 
said people familiar with his comments. Sup-
pose, Mr. Kaplan asked them, that the girls 
became Facebook super-sharers to promote 
cookies? Mitigating the reach of the plat-
form’s most dedicated users would unfairly 
thwart them, he said. 
Mr. Kaplan in the recent interview said he 
didn’t remember raising the Girl Scout ex-
ample but was concerned about the effect on 
publishers who happened to have enthusi-
astic followings. 
The 
debate 
got 
kicked 
up 
to 
Mr. 
Zuckerberg, who heard out both sides in a 
short meeting, said people briefed on it. His 
response: Do it, but cut the weighting by 
80%. Mr. Zuckerberg also signaled he was 
losing interest in the effort to recalibrate 
the platform in the name of social good, they 
said, asking that they not bring him some-
thing like that again. 
Mr. Uribe left Facebook and the tech in-
dustry within the year. He declined to dis-
cuss his work at Facebook in detail but con-
firmed his advocacy for the Sparing Sharing 
proposal. He said he left Facebook because of 
his frustration with company executives and 
their narrow focus on how integrity changes 
would affect American politics. While pro-
posals like his did disproportionately affect 
conservatives in the U.S., he said, in other 
countries the opposite was true. 
Other projects met Sparing Sharing’s fate: 
weakened, not killed. Partial victories in-
cluded efforts to promote news stories gar-
nering engagement from a broad user base, 
not just partisans, and penalties for pub-
lishers that repeatedly shared false news or 
directed users to ad-choked pages. 
The tug of war was resolved in part by the 
growing furor over the Cambridge Analytica 
scandal. In a September 2018 reorganization 
of Facebook’s newsfeed team, managers told 
employees the company’s priorities were 
shifting ‘‘away from societal good to indi-
vidual value,’’ said people present for the dis-
cussion. If users wanted to routinely view or 
post hostile content about groups they didn’t 
like, Facebook wouldn’t suppress it if the 
content didn’t specifically violate the com-
pany’s rules. 
Mr. Cox left the company several months 
later 
after 
disagreements 
regarding 
Facebook’s pivot toward private encrypted 
messaging. He hadn’t won most fights he had 
engaged in on integrity ranking and Com-
mon Ground product changes, people in-
volved in the effort said, and his departure 
left the remaining staffers working on such 
projects without a high-level advocate. 
The Common Ground team disbanded. The 
Integrity Teams still exist, though many 
senior staffers left the company or headed to 
Facebook’s Instagram platform. 
Mr. Zuckerberg announced in 2019 that 
Facebook would take down content violating 
specific standards but where possible take a 
hands-off approach to policing material not 
clearly violating its standards. 
‘‘You can’t impose tolerance top-down,’’ he 
said in an October speech at Georgetown 
University. ‘‘It has to come from people 
opening up, sharing experiences, and devel-
oping a shared story for society that we all 
feel we’re a part of. That’s how we make 
progress together.’’ 
END CHILD EXPLOITATION ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
want to take a moment to thank Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee Chairman 
LINDSEY GRAHAM for adding the bipar-
tisan and critically important END Ex-
ploitation Act to the EARN It Act, 
which is set for markup on Thursday. 
This bill, which I introduced with 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO, would lengthen 
evidence preservation time in online 
child exploitation cases and assist law 
enforcement in prosecuting child pred-
ators. Once passed, the law will double 
the length of time we require tech 
firms like Facebook and Snapchat to 
preserve evidence and reports of online 
child exploitation. 
In 2018, tech companies reported over 
45 million—45 million—photos and vid-
eos of children being sexually abused. 
Unfortunately, that was double the 
number of reports in 2017. This legisla-
tion will give the police more time to 
investigate these horrific crimes. It 
will put child predators in jail where 
they belong. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3685 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today is July 1. For millions of Ameri-
cans, the rent is due. Utility bills don’t 
stop, either. But too many New York 
families and too many American fami-
lies will be unable to make the pay-
ments amid the pandemic that has al-
ready hurt my city and its people. 
The first of the month should not be 
the end of the financial line for work-
ing families, and that is why we are 
here. We must continue to put real 
pressure on Leader MCCONNELL to pass 
the COVID 4 legislation that would in-
clude critical rent relief to families 
who desperately need the help. 
Our working families—many of color 
and other minority groups—are in des-
perate need of this basic assistance so 
they can continue working, feeding 
their families, making ends meet. That 
is our push today. 
Enact the Emergency Rental Assist-
ance and Rental Market Stabilization 
Act—which has a $100 billion promise 
to renters across the country—and the 
promise is real help during the real and 
unprecedented crisis. 
Let me give you some background. 
The Heroes Act would authorize $100 
billion for the Emergency Rental As-
sistance 
Program 
led 
by 
SHERROD 
BROWN, the ranking member of the 
Banking and Housing Committee, who 
has just done a great job letting people 
know the crisis and now acting on it. 
What it does is it helps families and in-
dividuals pay their rent and utility 
bills and remain in their homes during 
and after the COVID–19 crisis. 
The bill was already included in the 
House-passed and bipartisan Heroes 
Act, but, unfortunately, once again—as 
he does with so many other important 
issues—Senate Majority Leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL has refused to bring it to 
the floor, so Senator BROWN has come 
to ask the unanimous consent. 
Without basic assistance, even those 
renters who are currently shielded by 
temporary Federal and local eviction

bans may still face eviction. Let me 
tell you, once someone is evicted and 
homeless, they regress. The kids can’t 
go to school. Healthcare becomes even 
more remote. Getting to a job through 
public transportation is so difficult. 
This actually is a stitch in time that 
saves nine. If people can stay in their 
homes because they can’t pay the rent 
through no fault of their own, they 
have a better chance of reestablishing 
their lives and maybe even climbing up 
that American ladder. If they are 
kicked out of their homes because they 
can’t pay the rent, through no fault of 
their own, it is very, very difficult. 
They are in a deep, deep hole. 
We must, must do something for 
them. Senator BROWN, with his persist-
ence and passion, has put together the 
right plan. We talk about numbers, 
sure, but behind those numbers are the 
faces of countless New Yorkers we see 
each and every day on mass transit, 
walking the streets, working among us. 
These folks are fine, hard-working peo-
ple. All they want is a little dignity in 
their lives and ability to keep a roof 
over their heads. They need help now 
more than ever. 
We need action on this now, and that 
is the message to our friends on the 
other side of the aisle. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
thank the Democratic leader. 
I have a prepared speech I want to 
make, but I heard Senator SCHUMER 
talk about this. These are human 
beings. We in this body are Senators. 
We go back and forth to our States. We 
have the privilege of working pretty 
safe. We are paid. We aren’t exposed to 
the virus all that much, mostly be-
cause we are pretty careful because we 
can be, and we have jobs where we can 
be. 
Think about this. You work in a gro-
cery store, and you are exposed to the 
coronavirus. A grocery store worker 
told me one day: They tell me I am es-
sential, but I feel expendable because I 
am not very safe in this job, and they 
don’t pay me much. 
What 
if 
she 
gets 
laid 
off—that 
wouldn’t happen so much in a grocery 
store because they are hiring—but in 
another job, they get laid off. They 
have to worry about potential eviction. 
Their unemployment will run out at 
the end of July. We have done nothing 
to help them. 
What happens with all these people 
who get evicted? They end up on the 
streets or they go to homeless shelters 
that are too crowded. They go to live 
on their cousin’s couch in the base-
ment. What are the chances of them 
getting coronavirus? These are human 
beings in New York and Ohio and Idaho 
and Tennessee and all over. I can’t be-
lieve we are not about to do something 
about this. 
I thank the leader for his involve-
ment on this issue that is so impor-
tant. We are in the middle of a crisis, 
unlike anything any of us have ever 
lived through. That goes without say-
ing. Every single day we hear about 
hundreds and hundreds more Ameri-
cans dying. 
Back in March, South Korea had 90 
cases. We had 90 cases. The capital of 
South Korea is 800 miles from Wuhan 
where this virus started. They have 
had fewer than 300 people die. We have 
had 120,000. They don’t have better doc-
tors. They don’t have better public 
health. They don’t have better medical 
scientists. They have better leaders 
than we do, obviously. Their unemploy-
ment rate is under 4 percent and fewer 
than 300 people have died. The people 
who have died are our sisters, our 
brothers, our parents, our friends, and 
neighbors. 
The President of the United States 
and the Republican leader down the 
hall—who occasionally goes in and out 
of his office—have stopped pretending 
to care. They rarely talk about the 
coronavirus. The President rarely ex-
tends any sympathy to our brothers 
and our sisters and our parents and our 
friends and our neighbors who have 
been sick and who have died. It is not 
the President’s rich friends who are 
dying; it is our grandparents. They are 
the people in nursing homes. They are 
disproportionately 
the 
Black 
and 
Brown workers who caught the virus 
on the job. 
The Trump administration and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, essentially, have just 
given up. We can’t. We have to do our 
jobs. We need to show leadership where 
the President has failed and where the 
majority leader—the most powerful 
person in this body, the top elected of-
ficial in the Senate, says: ‘‘I see no ur-
gency.’’ He sees no urgency because he 
is not out talking to people who are 
about to be foreclosed on or evicted 
from their home. Imagine being evicted 
in the middle of a pandemic. Imagine 
the fear and anxiety a family have 
when they are in that position. 
We need to fight the health crisis and 
economic crisis. We can’t do one with-
out the other. Millions of Americans 
are in danger of being evicted and hav-
ing their homes foreclosed on. The last 
thing we need to do is turn them out on 
the streets. 
We have a housing crisis. Many know 
this. Senator MENENDEZ has joined us, 
who is one of the best advocates for 
these issues of anybody in the Senate. 
We knew there was a housing crisis be-
fore the coronavirus set. 
We know that one-fourth of renters 
in this country, before the coronavirus, 
paid more than half of their income in 
housing. One thing happens in their 
life, just one thing. Their car breaks 
down. Their child gets sick. They get 
in a car accident, and they are out of 
work for a week. They get evicted. 
They don’t have any kind of margin 
there. 
We know that professions we are rec-
ognizing as essential don’t pay enough 
to afford housing. We are seeing mil-
lions of people have these emergencies. 
The ones they had before, many people 
have now. Millions have them all at 
once. They face impossible choices be-
tween rent and groceries, or prescrip-
tions, or draining their savings, or 
going to a payday lender, and you 
never go to a payday lender once. You 
keep going back and back, and the in-
terest you pay is more than you origi-
nally borrowed. In essence, they have 
no choice at all. It is not a choice be-
tween prescriptions and groceries and 
draining their savings. It is no choice 
at all. Far too often, it ends up being 
eviction. 
In the CARES Act, we passed emer-
gency expansion of unemployment in-
surance. I appreciate my friend Sen-
ator CRAPO, chairman of this com-
mittee, who supported that and so 
much of what is in this package. We 
provided funding for the most imme-
diate needs of housing and organiza-
tions that put a temporary morato-
rium on evictions and foreclosures for 
some—not all renters and not nearly 
all homeowners. It is an important step 
but not enough. 
We face two huge cliffs. This is July 
1. On July 31, the $600 a month that has 
kept people in their homes and kept 
food on their table and kept clothes on 
the backs of their kids—that $600 a 
month ends come July 31. At the end, 
in many cases, the eviction morato-
rium ends. 
The President and Leader MCCON-
NELL don’t seem to notice. They don’t 
seem to care. For all those renters who 
have been protected, back rent will 
suddenly be due. You may have gotten 
a moratorium on your rent for 3 
months, but now you will owe for 4 
months. The same goes for millions 
who aren’t protected under the CARES 
Act but got relief from a temporary 
State or local moratorium or because 
their eviction courts were closed in 
many States. 
With tens of millions of people filing 
for unemployment, the President is 
still refusing to lead and do something 
about this virus to get it under control. 
We know people still need help. They 
still need help paying the rent. They 
still need help making mortgage pay-
ments. They still need help protecting 
themselves from evictions and fore-
closures. Forty percent of Black and 
Latinx renters report they are unlikely 
able to make their next payment—40 
percent. It is not because they are not 
working hard. They got laid off and are 
in low-wage jobs. 
That is why Senator MENENDEZ and I 
and Senator SCHUMER and others co-
sponsored and introduced—39 of my fel-
low colleagues—introduced the Emer-
gency Rental Assistance Stabilization 
Act. It would provide $100 billion for 
emergency rental assistance, including 
help with missed rent and utility bills. 
It already passed the House twice. 
It is included in the Heroes Act that 
they passed a month ago, but it is sit-
ting on the majority leader’s desk be-
cause he doesn’t seem to notice. For 
millions of families, the bills keep

coming and the clock keeps ticking 
and the stress keeps mounting. 
Now a second round of layoffs are 
starting because this President refuses 
to lead and get this virus under con-
trol. 
Two weeks ago, they reopened evic-
tion courts in Columbus. They opened 
the Convention Center to process evic-
tions. Think of the heartache in that 
building. People go to court and find 
out they are evicted. The judge brings 
down a gavel, and their lives turn up-
side down. Reflect on that. Tens of mil-
lions of people lose their jobs. We are 
not using arenas to play basketball or 
to play indoor soccer. We are not doing 
that now. We are using arenas as evic-
tion courts. 
Before 
this 
pandemic, 
President 
Trump and his wealthy Cabinet Mem-
bers didn’t realize or didn’t care that 
behind the rosy stock market data this 
economy was already broken for mil-
lions of workers—especially for Black 
and Brown workers for whom it never 
worked to begin. Now the Trump ad-
ministration—sort of like what hap-
pened with the Russians paying to kill 
American troops—the administration 
either doesn’t know it or doesn’t care 
that the bottom is falling out for these 
families. 
Without emergency rental assist-
ance, these families find themselves on 
the street with their lives turned up-
side down in the middle of a pandemic. 
People are tired of the lack of action 
and lack of accountability. They are 
tired of being betrayed by a leader who 
is supposed to look out for them. They 
are tired of feeling like no one is on 
their side. We are the greatest country 
on the Earth, and we should act like it. 
American people should not always 
have to fend for themselves because we 
have an indifferent majority leader and 
a President who doesn’t know or 
doesn’t care in the middle of this once- 
in-a-generation crisis. 
It is time to step up. It is time to 
lead. It is time to think about what it 
would be like to face an eviction, 
knowing your two small children and 
you don’t know where you are going to 
live. It is probably going to be in a 
homeless shelter or in a cousin’s base-
ment. You know your chances of get-
ting infected with the coronavirus go 
up. Just think about those people when 
we make these decisions. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 3685, the 
Emergency 
Rental 
Assistance 
and 
Rental Market Stabilization Act of 
2020. I ask that the bill be considered 
read three times and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
To date, Congress has appropriated 
nearly $3 trillion to protect, strength-
en, and support Americans in all walks 
of life, to fight the COVID–19 pandemic 
and to stabilize the infrastructure and 
our economic system. 
Senator BROWN and I worked on a big 
part of that package together on a 
team which was put together by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL to try to make sure 
we addressed, in a bipartisan fashion, 
the way to respond to this pandemic. 
The CARES Act has been central to 
the effort and includes measures to 
help families directly, to provide aid to 
small businesses, to assist those in the 
medical field and on the frontlines of 
our response effort, and to stabilize our 
markets. 
Soon 
after, 
Congress 
passed 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act—or CARES Act—codi-
fying and extending these protections 
and providing financial relief to rent-
ers—yes, to renters. 
Title IV of the CARES Act contains 
three housing provisions. Section 4022 
imposes a 60-day eviction and fore-
closure moratorium for single-family 
borrowers with federally backed mort-
gage loans. It allows struggling home-
owners 1 year of loan forbearance. 
Section 4023 extends similar relief to 
multifamily borrowers who are current 
on their mortgage payments. They can 
request up to 90-days forbearance as 
long as they do not evict the tenant or 
charge late fees during the pandemic. 
Section 4024 imposes a 120-day mora-
torium on evictions, fees, and pen-
alties. That moratorium will not expire 
until August 31. 
As with much of the CARES Act, the 
provisions dealing with stabilizing our 
economy and helping to support and 
sustain workers, small business own-
ers, homeowners, and home renters are 
all playing out right now as we speak. 
Yet the real objection here is that 
Senator MCCONNELL
and the Repub-
licans have said we want to work on 
looking at the next package of support, 
but we want to see how this one is 
playing out first and identify those 
places where we need to target the re-
lief most. 
The objection is that there is a de-
sire, once again, to go rapidly into 
passing the House bill and not having 
regular order follow in the Senate as 
we work to approach this issue as the 
existing CARES Act plays out. 
All of our housing agencies have ex-
tended this eviction and foreclosure 
moratorium and are working to help 
address the issues relating to tenants. 
HUD has expanded issuer assistance to 
include Pass-Through Assistance Pro-
gram support, which allows servicers 
to apply for assistance in meeting prin-
cipal and interest payments, and the 
FHFA has announced that no mortgage 
servicer will be responsible for advanc-
ing more than 4 months of missed prin-
cipal and interest payments on a loan. 
All of these things have been done to 
stabilize the housing markets and to 
assist low-income home ownership and 
home construction and assistance. 
While I am open to looking at the 
question of whether additional assist-
ance is needed for renters, home-
owners, and others in our society, I am 
not willing to simply bypass the proc-
ess in the Senate—ignore the consider-
ations that our leadership has called 
for as we look to see how our current 
support programs are playing out—and 
simply jam the House bill through the 
Senate without having any debate or 
process. 
This was the biggest rescue package 
in the history of Congress, and we in-
cluded a variety of oversight mecha-
nisms in the legislation to ensure that 
the dollars and programs associated 
with it reached their intended marks. 
Many of the provisions in the CARES 
Act and those appropriated dollars are 
still making their way to these individ-
uals and families and businesses and 
markets across the country. 
So we must work together to address 
these critical issues rather than simply 
try to jam one party’s or one side of 
this Congress’s approach to the solu-
tion without going through regular 
order. 
I would say the arguments that are 
being made that we or any of us are 
somehow turning a blind eye to the 
problems that exist could not be fur-
ther from the truth. As I said earlier, 
the reality is that we passed the larg-
est relief program in the history of this 
country. We are working to provide li-
quidity, as well as actual dollar relief, 
in the amount of trillions of dollars, 
and those programs are still playing 
out. 
We need to work together rather 
than, by unanimous consent request 
after unanimous consent request after 
unanimous consent request, try to jam 
down one side’s approach without look-
ing to find the cooperative solutions 
that I know we can. 
Like I said, I am open to working on 
these very issues, but the way to do it 
is not to come to the floor with a unan-
imous consent request—take it or leave 
it. We need to let proper, regular work-
ing order operate in the Senate, and we 
have time to do so. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, be-
fore turning to Senators MENENDEZ, 
CORTEZ
MASTO, WYDEN, KLOBUCHAR, 
REED, SCHATZ, and VAN HOLLEN, who 
all want to speak, I appreciate the 
comments from my friend—and he real-
ly is my friend—from Idaho. We work 
well together. 
We want to do regular order. This 
last bill was passed in March. Then 
there was April, May, June. Now we are 
in July. It is not a question of regular 
order. We would love to sit down with 
Senator MCCONNELL and start negoti-
ating as to what is next. We have want-
ed that really from about April 1. No 
April Fools’ joke there; we really want-
ed to do that. Instead, Senator MCCON-
NELL just seemed to ignore this. 
I mean, go back to the human side. 
What happens when somebody is unem-
ployed? We will be leaving now for 2

weeks. That is why we are doing these 
unanimous consent requests now. It is 
because we want to see action. We have 
asked and asked and begged and begged 
and pleaded and pleaded. So what hap-
pens? We will go back home for 2 more 
weeks. Right now, if you can’t find a 
job, if you are unemployed and are get-
ting that $600 a week, you start paying 
attention online or you read the papers 
or however you get your information, 
and you find out that this is going to 
expire at the end of July. You don’t 
know what you are going to do, but 
you know that you haven’t paid rent in 
3 months because you have had an evic-
tion moratorium. 
Senator CRAPO talked about the mor-
atorium. Only half of the people who 
pay mortgages are subject to that mor-
atorium and are protected, and only a 
third of people who rent are. So, for 
most people, that is simply not the 
case. 
Now that the eviction courts are 
open and the evictions are starting, 
what happens to those people? Are we 
just going to say: Well, let’s see it play 
out. We know what will happen. If you 
don’t have rental assistance, if you lose 
your unemployment and don’t get that 
$1,200 check, which is basically 1 
month’s rent for most people, we know 
what is going to happen to you. Your 
life is going to turn upside down. That 
is why we need to move. That is why 
we need to pass this. 
I 
am 
disappointed 
that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL has shown no interest in 
doing anything on this other than just 
sitting tight and hoping that the 
money he raises from special inter-
ests—from tobacco, the gun lobby, 
banks, and insurance companies—can 
help his candidates get reelected and 
he can be majority leader again. 
I yield the floor to Senator MENEN-
DEZ. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
let me thank my colleague, the rank-
ing Democrat—the senior Democrat— 
on the Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs, for his passion 
and his commitment. He has really ele-
vated housing within the jurisdiction 
of the committee, which is something I 
am passionate about. Very often, ev-
eryone refers to the committee as the 
Banking Committee, but housing is a 
critical element of what it does. He has 
elevated it, and I really appreciate his 
passion on behalf of the millions who 
rent or who are fortunate enough to 
own homes and want to keep them to 
try to be able to do so. 
I would just say to my distinguished 
chairman of the committee that I do 
have the highest respect for him. 
Look, with the CARES package, we 
lumped in trillions of dollars, but over-
whelmingly that money went to busi-
nesses. Of course, I support that, but it 
went to businesses. It went to sustain 
businesses. It went to ultimately help 
small, midsized, and even large busi-
nesses. It went to sustain sectors of our 
economy like the airline industry and 
others. 
What we are talking about goes to 
the very essence of what it is to have a 
home. ‘‘Home’’ is one of the most im-
portant American concepts. It is where 
we are taken when we are born. It is 
where we are nurtured while we are 
young. It is where we are schooled. It is 
where good times and bad times take 
place. Ultimately, it is where we build 
a life around our families if we are for-
tunate to have a home. Then, in a pan-
demic, we have learned that it is also a 
place in which to shelter. 
I come to the floor today to warn of 
an impending storm that is brewing, 
and it is headed our way. 
When the funds for the PPP—for the 
business program—ran out, we didn’t 
have regular order to see if the PPP 
had been working well. No. There was a 
rush to put more billions in it. It was 
only when we said ‘‘Wait a minute, this 
isn’t working so well for small and 
midsized businesses’’ that we made 
some reforms. So there was a rush 
then. There was no regular order. 
We have a storm that is brewing and 
is headed our way. It will bring with it 
enormous financial pain. It will threat-
en public safety. It will make fighting 
the pandemic that much harder, and it 
will set back our Nation’s economic re-
covery. If the Senate fails to respond to 
this looming crisis, Americans will 
needlessly suffer; families will be dis-
placed; personal fortunes will be wiped 
out; and the scars will run so deep that 
it could take decades to heal the 
wounds. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic took hold, 
the one saving grace most of us had— 
the one place we could take refuge to 
protect ourselves and our families—was 
our home. Our leading medical experts 
all urged us to stay home. If you are 
sick, stay home. If you have an under-
lying 
condition 
or 
are 
immunocompromised, stay home. If 
you are elderly or otherwise at risk, 
stay home. If you can, work from 
home. If you are a student, go online 
and learn from home. If we have 
learned anything from this pandemic, 
it is that staying home can help to con-
tain the virus, flatten the curve, and 
save lives. 
What if you don’t have a home? As 
we speak, millions of our fellow Ameri-
cans are asking themselves that very 
same question. 
At a time when COVID–19 cases are 
spiking across the country, the provi-
sions that we passed in the CARES Act 
to help renters and homeowners stay in 
their homes are about to run out. If we 
do nothing, we could face a foreclosure 
and eviction crisis far greater than 
that which we encountered during the 
great recession. 
There is a storm on the horizon. 
Americans shouldn’t have to fear being 
thrown out on the street if they miss 
their next rent or mortgage payments 
through, really, no fault of their own. 
They shouldn’t have to fear losing 
their greatest personal assets or that 
one safe place in the middle of a pan-
demic, further exposing themselves and 
others to the virus. 
The Senate can stop this if it wants 
to. We can make sure that every Amer-
ican has a safe and healthy place to 
call home. That is why I joined my 
Democratic colleagues on the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs in introducing two bills 
last month that will provide assistance 
to homeowners and renters. 
The Housing Assistance Fund, led by 
Senator REED, provides $75 billion in 
targeted assistance to keep people in 
their homes while they search for new 
employment or a way to get back to 
work. This money can go toward mort-
gage payments or utilities or as other 
support to prevent eviction, delin-
quency, or foreclosure. 
The Emergency Rental Assistance 
and Rental Market Stabilization Act, 
led by Senator BROWN, would provide 
$100 billion in rental assistance to help 
families pay rent and help property 
owners maintain safe and healthy 
housing. It will help the economic re-
covery by stabilizing the rental market 
overall. 
We also have to empower Americans 
to make informed financial decisions— 
to help them navigate the maze of 
lenders, landlords, government agen-
cies—to find a sustainable path to stay 
in their homes. 
We all know there is a housing af-
fordability crisis in this country that 
jeopardizes the aspirations of millions 
of Americans who hope to join the mid-
dle class, and just as they have borne 
the brunt of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
low-income and minority Americans 
will disproportionately suffer during 
economic downturns. 
The provisions that the chairman 
talked about in the law that we passed 
in order to help are going to be expir-
ing. To the extent that you know about 
it, you might invoke it to protect your-
self against an eviction or a mortgage 
foreclosure, but if you don’t know 
about it and either the financial insti-
tution or your landlord looks the other 
way and doesn’t follow the law, well 
then, you won’t get the protection. 
That is why I and 19 of my Demo-
cratic colleagues introduced a bill on 
Monday to provide $700 million in hous-
ing counseling assistance. Research 
shows that homeowners who receive 
housing counseling have better out-
comes than those who don’t, and that 
evidence is overwhelming. Their risk of 
default goes down, and they are more 
likely to see their credit scores rise 
and their debt levels fall. 
In rough times like we are in right 
now, these borrowers are more likely 
to get sustainable mortgage modifica-
tions and are less likely to end up in 
default. The benefits of housing coun-
seling flow to the community at large 
because when a family is able to buy a 
home, pay their mortgage, build eq-
uity, and ultimately achieve the Amer-
ican dream, our towns and cities 
thrive. And during a pandemic, having

a safe and affordable place to live could 
mean the difference between life and 
death. 
It is also especially important for 
senior citizens, who are more suscep-
tible to COVID–19. So tomorrow I will 
introduce legislation to provide $1.2 
billion in aid for older adults living in 
federally assisted housing. 
This bill provides additional rental 
assistance for senior housing, personal 
protective gear, and staffing to help 
maintain a healthy community. 
So the forecasts are in. The storm is 
coming. The question is, What are we 
going to do about it? 
The Fourth of July is Independence 
Day. It is nice to have independence 
from the fear that I will lose the place 
that I call home. That would be a tre-
mendous gift on the Fourth of July. 
Are we going to help our most vul-
nerable citizens during this pandemic 
or are we going to just watch them suf-
fer, lose everything, and exacerbate 
this public health crisis? 
Today is July 1. The rent is due. 
Mortgage payments are due. The Sen-
ate’s work is due. 
I remember—and I will close with 
this personal anecdote—when I was 
growing up poor in a tenement in New 
Jersey, the son of an itinerant car-
penter and a seamstress, there wasn’t 
always work, which meant that some-
times paying the rent was a real tough 
choice. And it was a choice of paying 
the rent or putting food on the table. I 
saw the anxiety in my mother’s eyes. I 
saw the fear in my siblings not know-
ing whether that apartment in that 
tenement was something we were even 
going to be able to keep. That wasn’t 
in a pandemic. That was just in normal 
times. Imagine in a pandemic, you are 
told to stay home, and there is no place 
to call home. We can do much better 
than that. We can do much better than 
that. 
July 1, the rent is due. The mortgage 
payment is due. The Senate’s work is 
due. Let’s pass this bill today and 
make sure every American can weather 
the pandemic in a safe and affordable 
place to call home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Because a lot of my col-
leagues have been so thoughtful, I will 
have some brief remarks, and then I 
would ask unanimous consent that 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO could follow me 
because she is facing a tight schedule 
as well. I know all of my colleagues 
are. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I join 
my colleagues this afternoon in appre-
ciation of Senator BROWN, who has 
been relentless—absolutely relentless— 
in prosecuting this cause of trying to 
get a fair shake for millions of Ameri-
cans who are walking on an economic 
tightrope. Every single month, they 
balance the food bill against the rent 
bill against the energy bill, and Sen-
ator 
BROWN—whether 
it 
is 
super-
charged 
unemployment 
benefits, 
whether it is housing, whether it is 
taking on the big pharmaceutical com-
panies—is there again and again and 
again to stand up for people who don’t 
have power and don’t have clout, and I 
want to thank him especially for giv-
ing us this opportunity to focus on the 
avalanche of evictions that I believe 
will be headed in our direction in 
weeks if the Senate doesn’t act. 
Yesterday, Dr. Fauci talked about 
soon possibly seeing as many as 100,000 
new coronavirus cases a day. You sim-
ply cannot have a healthy economy in 
a country suffering from mass illness 
and death. 
There are already tens of millions of 
Americans out of work as a result of a 
pandemic that is only continuing to 
spread, and it has hit the whole afford-
ability of rent for millions of Ameri-
cans like a powerful storm. 
According to the Census Bureau, 40 
percent of Black and Latino renters are 
worried they will not be able to make 
the rent this summer due to the pan-
demic. That in and of itself is an out-
rage and an injustice. 
My question for our Republican col-
leagues today involves this frightening 
day at the beginning of the month—the 
frightening 
day 
when 
families 
sit 
around a kitchen table, all across the 
country, and you can see the anguish 
in their faces when you talk to them 
because, around that kitchen table, 
they are saying to themselves: What 
am I going to spend our scarce dollars 
on this month? Is it going to be the 
rent? Is it going to be groceries? What 
about that big pile of medical bills that 
is off in the corner that we have to 
pay? 
It is July 1, and the rent is due. Our 
question for our Republican colleagues 
is, What is your plan? 
Senator BROWN has been leading us 
every day—day in, day out—with a set 
of sensible policies that respond to 
what those families are saying around 
their kitchen tables. We fought for the 
moratorium on evictions that was in-
cluded in the CARES Act, but it goes 
poof in a few weeks. 
Already this week my Republican 
colleagues have blocked funding for 
State and local governments that could 
have been used to help people who are 
walking that economic tightrope. 
This morning, Leader SCHUMER and I 
laid out a plan that I think is a path to 
a dependable safety net in America 
and, specifically, an extension of super-
charged unemployment benefits, which 
ties the benefit to economic conditions 
on the ground. It will be a financial 
lifeline for millions and millions of 
people. Republicans have been opposed 
to that. Those benefits are going to ex-
pire in a matter of weeks, and as I said 
to colleagues: Better know what you 
are going to be looking at when you go 
home in August if there hasn’t been ac-
tion on our legislation to make sure 
that there are supercharged unemploy-
ment benefits so that people can pay 
the rent and buy groceries. 
If they are home all August long, in 
the heat with families, and they are 
going to have nowhere to turn in terms 
of paying for a roof over their heads 
and groceries, this is going to be a 
long, long, hot summer that will never 
be forgotten. 
So let’s be clear what is at stake. 
Long before the pandemic hit, housing 
cost too much. Homelessness was way 
too common, and, in my view, the rate 
of homelessness among children is a 
true national scandal. 
In the wealthiest Nation on Earth, no 
child should be without a home. But 
even before the COVID crisis, 1.5 mil-
lion children were experiencing home-
lessness—1.5 million youngsters living 
outside, living in cars, sleeping on 
floors, sleeping on the ground. 
Colleagues, in my home State, they 
have said that school buses have had to 
go to the parks. They have had to go to 
the parks to pick up kids who are liv-
ing outside with their families. 
It rains once in a while in Oregon. It 
is cold in Oregon. And to think that 
kids in the richest country on Earth 
are spending the night in the parks and 
the school buses have to come and get 
them while we have huge tax cuts for 
those who are powerful and have lobby-
ists shows that things are really out of 
whack. 
What I describe as it relates to those 
kids living in the parks—those kinds of 
conditions exist for youngsters all over 
America, and that was before the job-
lessness crisis hit and threw so many 
more working families into economic 
hardship. 
If the Senate doesn’t step up to help 
families stay in their homes, it is going 
to get much, much worse because there 
are hundreds of thousands, if not mil-
lions, of kids facing this recipe for dis-
aster. They are out of school. They are 
isolated, and they are more exposed to 
neglect and abuse. I am so pleased that 
my friend from Nevada has been talk-
ing about those families and talking 
about those kids. 
They are hungry. Their families are 
facing the threat of eviction. If the 
Senate just sits back and allows these 
children to fall into homelessness, they 
may never have a chance to get ahead. 
So what it comes down to is that the 
Senate has an obligation to help, and 
Senator BROWN is on target in saying 
that this is the time to pass his Emer-
gency Rental Assistance Act. I am with 
him. I think we have a lot of colleagues 
here in the queue because they, too, 
want to speak up for the radical idea— 
what a radical proposition—that in the 
richest country on Earth, the vulner-
able ought to have a roof over their 
head. 
Senator BROWN’s proposal is a vital 
step forward. I think we all agree that 
much more needs to be done. I am very 
interested in the proposal I call the 
DASH Act, the Decent, Affordable and 
Safe Housing for All Act. I hope we will 
be able to get serious about that in 
2021. 
The step to take today is to pass Sen-
ator BROWN’s bill, and I look forward to

being back with our colleagues day in, 
day out, focusing on this crisis and 
making sure that nobody thinks we are 
going to skip away until the Repub-
licans act. 
This country faces a truly horrific 
eviction nightmare if action is not 
taken soon, and I am very pleased that 
my friend from Nevada is here. 
I yield the floor to her. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here today to support my 
colleagues and our cause to keep Amer-
icans in their homes. It is very simple. 
The House has already passed a number 
of bills to do just that, and the Senate 
needs to do the same thing. 
In 
this 
pandemic, 
housing 
is 
healthcare. I know that a lot of Ameri-
cans have had their lives upended by 
this coronavirus pandemic, but I would 
like you to imagine for a moment how 
much more chaotic your life would feel 
if you found out that tomorrow you are 
going to be evicted. Imagine trying to 
make sure you are washing your hands 
while you are living in your car. 
We are in the middle of a public 
health crisis where we need people to 
be socially distancing, and that means 
they simply must have a safe, stable 
place to be at the end of the day. 
We realized this months ago in my 
State, and that is why Governor 
Sisolak put a hold on evicting resi-
dents through August 31 of this year. 
And Congress? Well, we passed the 
CARES Act to provide unemployment 
benefits and one-time relief. Those 
funds, plus the ban on evictions, were 
intended to help keep families in their 
homes. 
We are 60 days away from resuming 
evictions in Nevada. In my State and 
across the country, the wave of evic-
tions we have been holding off for a 
month is going to come crashing down 
if we do not act now. 
Nevada has the highest unemploy-
ment rate in the entire country. In 
May, it was over 25 percent—as high as 
the national rate during the worst of 
the Great Depression. On top of that, 
some Nevadans haven’t yet received 
their unemployment benefits or their 
pandemic unemployment benefits. 
Across the country, almost half of 
workers earning under $40,000 a year 
have lost income. Some people just 
don’t have the ability to fully pay for 
the rent or mortgage, particularly 
when we are asking them to shelter in 
place. 
The thing is, in Nevada, we were al-
ready in the midst of a housing crisis 
even before this pandemic hit us. Al-
most half of Nevadans are renters. 
That is 45 percent. Of those renters, 
half are cost-burdened in some way, 
meaning that they pay more than 30 
percent of their income in rent. 
Now, the Silver State has the biggest 
shortage in the country of affordable 
housing for the very lowest income Ne-
vadans. We have just 19 units for every 
100 that we need. 
Eviction isn’t just a matter of spend-
ing a few days scrambling to find a new 
place. The financial consequences can 
follow families for years, and as for the 
effects on children’s physical and men-
tal health, well, there is no way to 
undo that. 
Believe me. I know. The foreclosure 
crisis hit Nevada in 2008, and I saw up 
close the pain that caused throughout 
my State when people were evicted 
from their homes. Lenders took the 
homes of more than 219,000 Nevada 
families during that period of time. 
That is why it is so vital that we pass 
legislation now to help Nevadans and 
people all across the country pay their 
rent and utility bills when they cannot 
safely go to work. 
I support Senator BROWN’s Emer-
gency Rental Assistance and Rental 
Market Stabilization Act, as well as 
other bills introduced by my colleagues 
to keep homeowners in their homes. 
These bills provide essential stability 
to the rental and mortgage market. 
We can’t expect landlords to keep 
shouldering the burden of missed pay-
ments. Landlords have bills to pay, as 
well—mortgages, taxes, insurance, and 
staff. Without assistance from us, 
many of them may go bankrupt or can 
be forced to sell their properties. 
Experts estimate that Nevada is 
going to need nearly $1 billion in rental 
assistance to keep families housed this 
year. Landlords can’t lift the load and 
neither can State budgets that are al-
ready stretched too thin. 
So let’s focus here on the essentials, 
the basic need for things like shelter. 
Let’s keep people safe and off the 
streets. Let’s pass Senator BROWN’s 
rental assistance bill, Senator REED’s 
housing assistance fund bill to help 
homeowners 
avoid 
foreclosure, 
and 
Senator 
MENENDEZ’s 
housing 
coun-
seling bill, and the others we need to 
prevent an epidemic of homelessness. 
Across the Nation people are re-
sponding to the pandemic by staying at 
home because we asked them to do so. 
Now the Senate needs to do its part by 
making sure those homes are safe and 
stable so that Nevadans can continue 
to teach their children, care for loved 
ones who are ill, and avoid spreading 
coronavirus to others. In the midst of a 
global pandemic, housing is healthcare, 
and we owe this to each other. So let’s 
act now on behalf of the American pub-
lic and American families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
to support efforts by my Democratic 
colleagues to pass much needed and de-
layed economic measures by unani-
mous consent. 
It is painfully obvious that the econ-
omy is in bad shape. Families and 
small businesses continue to struggle 
and there is a real need for further Fed-
eral assistance. In order to get our 
economy back on track, this body must 
take action in crafting another com-
prehensive, bipartisan COVID relief 
package, and it must include addi-
tional help for families and commu-
nities including eviction and fore-
closure prevention assistance, as well 
as additional help for State and local 
governments. 
Last night the Senate unanimously 
extended the PPP application window. 
This was a tiny but needed step in rec-
ognizing the depth of the economic cri-
sis Americans are facing. Now the 
question before us is, will Republican 
leaders allow this body to work its will 
and provide needed, targeted, and effec-
tive rescue assistance, or will it con-
tinue to delay and deny assistance 
which will only prolong the pandemic, 
deepen the financial hole, and make 
the remedy costlier and recovery steep-
er? 
Strong State and local governments 
are critical to our economy. Indeed, ac-
cording to the Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities, State and local gov-
ernments provide about 20 million jobs 
and contributed 8.5 percent to the na-
tional GDP in 2019. They did so by not 
only serving as customers and clients 
for our local and national businesses, 
but also by providing the essential 
services, such as public infrastructure, 
a strong education system, and other 
necessary functions that provide the 
business certainty that make our coun-
try attractive to businesses and inves-
tors throughout the world. We should 
do everything possible to maintain our 
country’s comparative advantage rel-
ative to other countries. 
But today, as a result of the tremen-
dous economic shock created by the 
coronavirus and the lack of a coherent 
public health strategy from the Trump 
administration, estimated State rev-
enue shortfalls will total about $615 bil-
lion over the next 3 fiscal years, not in-
cluding the added costs of fighting 
COVID–19. This is just for the States— 
$615 billion. 
This is why I initially fought for $750 
billion in the Coronavirus Relief Fund 
when negotiating the CARES Act and 
introduced S. 3671, the State & Local 
Emergency Stabilization Fund Act, 
which would provide an additional $600 
billion to State and local governments 
to supplement the $150 billion in 
coronavirus relief funds I secured in 
the CARES Act. 
Madam President, would it surprise 
you to learn that the Trump Treasury 
Department has needlessly created a 
bureaucratic regulation that makes it 
difficult 
for 
States 
to 
use 
these 
coronavirus relief funds? And that this 
regulation is standing in the way of 
what should have been an immediate 
$150 billion boost to our economy, 
which even the Chamber of Commerce 
thinks is burdensome. Because of this 
onerous Trump rule, States can’t use 
the coronavirus relief funds to replace 
lost or delayed tax revenues in order to 
maintain public services. 
That is what Neil Bradley, the U.S. 
Chamber’s chief policy officer said in 
an interview, ‘‘Part of our conversation 
with Republicans on Capitol Hill is

that, ironically, if your concern is big 
State government, then the last thing 
you need to do is force States to re-
place one-time lost revenue with per-
manent tax increases.’’ 
As 
the 
primary 
author 
of 
the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund, I can tell you 
that it is fully within the Treasury 
Secretary’s authority and the intent of 
the CARES Act for these funds to be 
used to replace lost or delayed tax rev-
enues and maintain public services. To 
prevent the flexible use of these relief 
funds is a choice that is neither re-
quired nor intended by law. 
Unfortunately, this completely un-
necessary choice has already created 
avoidable economic harm. 
Since February, State and local gov-
ernments have cut a total of 1.5 million 
jobs, an 8-percent drop that is twice 
the decline seen during and after the 
2007–2009 recession. In addition, the 
Center for Economic and Policy Re-
search reports that ‘‘job losses forced 
on State and local governments by 
pandemic-related shortfalls will dis-
proportionately impact the African 
American workforce . . . 14 percent of 
state and local employees were African 
American compared to 11.7 percent of 
private sector employees, a margin of 
20 percent.’’ 
As the Wall Street Journal reported 
in a May 24, 2020, article titled ‘‘State 
and Local Budget Woes Create Drag for 
Economic Recovery Prospects″: 
Based on evidence from the last recession, 
Mr. Chodorow-Reich, a Harvard economics 
professor, estimates that every dollar in cuts 
costs the economy $1.50 to $2. He also said 
every additional dollar in spending adds $1.50 
to $2 to the economy. 
Of all the regulations that this ad-
ministration seeks to cut, it should 
start with this one if it really wants a 
healthy economy. With just one stroke 
of the Treasury Secretary’s pen, our 
economy can receive a direct multibil-
lion dollar jolt today. 
But to be clear, this administrative 
fix is by no means sufficient because of 
the massive revenue shortfalls our 
State and local governments are fac-
ing. Congress still needs to provide ad-
ditional and flexible fiscal relief to our 
State and local governments as part of 
its next fiscal package, and it is my 
hope that S. 3671, the State & Local 
Stabilization Fund Act, is included. 
As I indicated earlier in my remarks, 
keeping families in their homes also 
must be included in the next package. 
According to Nicholas Chiumenti, 
with the New England Public Policy 
Center in the research department at 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston: 
If current economic activity does not im-
prove substantially, without an extension of 
the CARES Act, unemployment insurance or 
additional stimulus money or other fiscal re-
lief, up to 13 percent of homeowners and 33 
percent of renters in Rhode Island are at the 
risk of being unable to pay their mortgage or 
rent payments. This represents over 80,000 
Rhode Island households. 
Nationally, according to census sur-
vey data, 23 percent of all adults re-
ported being housing insecure in mid- 
June, meaning that they had missed 
last month’s rent or mortgage payment 
or had slight or no confidence that 
their household could pay next month’s 
rent or mortgage on time. 
We know that behind each one of 
these numbers is a family that can be 
homeless at the worst possible time in 
the middle of a public health emer-
gency. 
For some, given their current health 
situations and age, there will be an ad-
ditional human toll that we surely 
should strive to avoid. We implore our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to work with us to keep our constitu-
ents in their homes so that they too 
can make it to the other side of this 
public health emergency. 
In that spirit, I draw your attention 
to S. 3620, the Housing Assistance 
Fund. This legislation expands the ex-
isting ‘‘Hardest Hit Fund’’ model and 
provides it with additional resources 
for each State to keep families in their 
homes, the utilities on, the internet 
connected, and the property taxes paid. 
As a result, landlords who are also 
struggling to pay their own bills would 
receive some assistance. 
Madam President, it is not every day 
that 
the 
Independent 
Community 
Bankers of America and the Credit 
Union National Association support 
the same legislation with consumer 
rights and affordable housing organiza-
tions, such as the National Housing 
Conference, the National Low Income 
Housing Coalition, the Center for Re-
sponsible Lending, and the National 
Consumer Law Center, among others. 
As we work toward this next fiscal re-
lief package, I hope you and our col-
leagues will consider joining with us in 
enacting S. 3620, the Housing Assist-
ance Fund. 
But we can’t stop there. We must 
also immediately, among other needs, 
increase SNAP benefits to help the al-
most 150,000 Rhode Islanders who are 
food insecure during this crisis; boost 
public health efforts to help keep the 
virus at bay, from more testing and 
contact tracing to supporting our 
healthcare providers, to developing ef-
fective vaccine deployment systems; 
help childcare centers, public schools, 
and college campuses to safely reopen 
and support libraries in keeping our 
communities connected; provide relief 
for the hardest hit small and mid-sized 
businesses, many of which will con-
tinue to be shut down for the foresee-
able future; and safeguard our election 
infrastructure, as Russia and other for-
eign actors seek again to use voter sup-
pression, hacking, and disinformation 
in the 2020 elections. 
What exactly are we waiting for? Is it 
not enough that, according to a June 29 
CNBC article, ‘‘the employment-popu-
lation ratio—the number of employed 
people as a percentage of the U.S. adult 
population—plunged to 52.8 percent in 
May, meaning 47.2 percent of Ameri-
cans are jobless, according to the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics? 
Is it not enough that 46 percent of 
Business Roundtable CEOs expect em-
ployment at their companies to de-
crease in the next 6 months? 
We don’t need to inflict any further 
unnecessary economic pain and suf-
fering. I would also urge my colleagues 
to consider the costs of inaction. 
Indeed, during an April 29, 2020, press 
conference, Federal Reserve Chairman 
Powell stated: 
I have long-time been an advocate for the 
need for the United States to return to a sus-
tainable path from a fiscal perspective at the 
Federal level. We have not been on such a 
path for some time, which . . . just means 
that the debt is growing faster than the 
economy. 
This is not the time to act on those con-
cerns. This is the time to use the great fiscal 
power of the United States to do what we can 
to support the economy and try to get 
through this with as little damage to the 
longer-run productive capacity of the econ-
omy as possible. 
This week we are also considering 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, and every year for the last 59 
years, Democrats and Republicans have 
come together to strengthen our na-
tional security and to help all Ameri-
cans. We have proven that we are more 
than capable of working together pro-
ductively on the most complex and 
controversial issues in service of our 
constituents, and we would like to con-
tinue that not just in the context of 
national defense but in the context of 
economic prosperity and security. 
One final point. We also need to ex-
tend unemployment compensation in-
surance because we know it will run 
out, and everyone has told us that un-
employment rates will not drop dra-
matically. They will stay persistently 
high. People will need this assistance 
going forward. 
We must do more, and I hope we can 
do much more going forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a 
motion to be made, but before making 
it, I yield 3 minutes each to Senator

objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

allowing me to say a few words. I know 
it is his time. And I thank my friend 
JACK REED. 
Today is July 1, which means that 
rent and mortgage payments are due, 
and as I speak today, so many families 
across this country are being forced to 
make the difficult decision about how 
they will make this month’s payment 
to stay in their homes. 
Even before the pandemic began, al-
most one-fourth of all renters, or 11 
million households, were forced to pay 
more than half of their income for 
housing—half of their income. Accord-
ing to the National Low Income Hous-
ing Coalition, more than half a million 
people experienced homelessness on a

given night before the pandemic, and 
that has just gotten worse. 
That is why I am a strong supporter 
of Senator BROWN’s Emergency Rental 
Assistance and Rental Market Sta-
bilization Act, which will provide $100 
billion in emergency funding. I am also 
proud to support Senator REED’s bill as 
well as the work of Senator MENENDEZ. 
The pandemic, as we know, has wide 
and longstanding racial disparities in 
housing. We had a 30-percent gap in 
Black and White ownership rates be-
fore the pandemic due to discrimina-
tory practices, and it has only made it 
worse. 
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, a lead-
er and a good friend, has repeatedly re-
minded us that this means investing in 
programs like section 8 housing, which 
still remains unavailable to so many 
families. 
Yes, we need to address this shortage 
of affordable housing. We need to take 
action now. I thank my colleagues. We 
have an opportunity. The Fourth of 
July is at the beginning of July, but by 
the end of July, we had better have 
gotten something done, and that means 
help our State and local governments; 
that means funding for elections; and 
that means making sure we are re-
sponding to the crisis in housing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today is 
the 1st of the month, and that means 
the rent is due, but for the 9 million 
renters who have lost their jobs, they 
may not be able to pay. 
Now, in March, we made sure that 
the CARES Act included cash assist-
ance, unemployment benefits, and sus-
pensions on evictions and mortgage 
forbearance to help the people who 
have been hurt the most by this pan-
demic. Lots of States and counties 
have set up their own programs, either 
subsidies or prohibitions on evictions 
themselves, but we are now 3 months 
later, 
and 
unemployment 
benefits 
stand to expire at the end of this 
month and moratoriums that allowed 
families to stay in their homes are end-
ing. Eviction courts are reopening. 
Think about that. Eviction courts are 
reopening. 
So what we are facing is a ticking 
timebomb. We are facing the fact that 
it is true that people got forbearance 
on their rent or forbearance on their 
mortgage, but I remember very well in 
March and April, as I explained to the 
people of Hawaii, you are getting for-
bearance not forgiveness, which means 
you just simply don’t have to pay your 
mortgage or your rent this month. You 
do have to eventually pay your mort-
gage or your rent. 
So what is going to happen is, for the 
most economically challenged among 
us in the United States, they are going 
to face a huge backpayment at the be-
ginning of August or the beginning of 
September, and they are going to lose 
the place they live in. 
Now, I am very, very hopeful that 
cooler heads will prevail and that we 
will intervene in July and incorporate 
the legislation Senator BROWN is lead-
ing because the rent is going to be due, 
and we are going to—just as we faced 
this pandemic square in the eyes, we 
are going to be facing a massive evic-
tion crisis. We have to take action. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while we 
continue negotiating an agreement on 
amendments, I think we need to move 
forward and start voting on some of 
the amendments we know need votes. 
Therefore, in just a minute, I will 
call up the Paul amendment regarding 
the withdrawing of troops from Af-
ghanistan. While I disagree with the 
substance of the amendment, I think 
the Senate should vote on it. So, at 5:30 
today, I will move to table the amend-
ment. We have talked to Senator 
PAUL’s office about this. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2011 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up 
the Paul amendment No. 2011 to the 
text proposed to be stricken. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The 
Senator 
from 
Oklahoma 
[Mr. 
INHOFE], for Mr. PAUL, proposes an amend-
ment numbered 2011. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading be 
dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To withdraw all United States 
Armed Forces from Afghanistan) 
At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1216. WITHDRAWAL OF UNITED STATES 
ARMED 
FORCES 
FROM 
AFGHANI-
STAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Joint Resolution to authorize the 
use of United States Armed Forces against 
those responsible for the attacks launched 
against the United States (Public Law 107– 
40) states, ‘‘That the President is authorized 
to use all necessary and appropriate force 
against those nations, organizations, or per-
sons he determines planned, authorized, 
committed, or aided the terrorist attacks 
that occurred on September 11, 2001’’. 
(2) Since 2001, more than 3,002,635 men and 
women of the United States Armed Forces 
have deployed in support of the Global War 
on Terrorism, with more than 1,400,000 of 
them deploying more than once, and these 
Americans who volunteered in a time of war 
have served their country honorably and 
with distinction. 
(3) In November 2009 there were fewer than 
100 Al-Qaeda members remaining in Afghani-
stan. 
(4) On May 2, 2011, Osama Bin Laden, the 
founder of Al-Qaeda, was killed by United 
States Armed Forces in Pakistan. 
(5) United States Armed Forces have suc-
cessfully routed Al-Qaeda from the battle-
field in Afghanistan, thus fulfilling the origi-
nal intent of Public Law 107–40 and the jus-
tification for the invasion of Afghanistan, 
but public support for United States contin-
ued presence in Afghanistan has waned in re-
cent years. 
(6) An October 2018 poll found that 57 per-
cent of Americans, including 69 percent of 
United States veterans, believe that all 
United States troops should be removed from 
Afghanistan. 
(7) In June 2018, the Department of Defense 
reported, ‘‘The al-Qa’ida threat to the United 
States and its allies and partners has de-
creased and the few remaining al-Qa’ida core 
members are focused on their own survival’’. 
(b) PLAN REQUIRED.—Not later than 45 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Defense, or designee, in co-
operation with the heads of all other rel-
evant Federal agencies involved in the con-
flict in Afghanistan shall— 
(1)(A) formulate a plan for the orderly 
drawdown and withdrawal of all soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, and Marines from Afghani-
stan who were involved in operations in-
tended to provide security to the people of 
Afghanistan, including policing action, or 
military actions against paramilitary orga-
nizations 
inside 
Afghanistan, 
excluding 
members of the military assigned to support 
United States embassies or consulates, or in-
telligence operations authorized by Con-
gress; and 
(B) appear before the relevant congres-
sional committees to explain the proposed 
implementation 
of 
the 
plan 
formulated 
under subparagraph (A); and 
(2)(A) formulate a framework for political 
reconciliation and popular democratic elec-
tions independent of United States involve-
ment in Afghanistan, which may be used by 
the Government of Afghanistan to ensure 
that any political party that meets the re-
quirements under Article 35 of the Constitu-
tion of Afghanistan is permitted to partici-
pate in general elections; and 
(B) appear before the relevant congres-
sional committees to explain the proposed 
implementation of the framework formu-
lated under subparagraph (A). 
(c) REMOVAL AND BONUSES.—Not later than 
1 year after the date of the enactment of this 
Act— 
(1) all United States Armed Forces in Af-
ghanistan as of such date of enactment shall 
be withdrawn and removed from Afghani-
stan; and 
(2) the Secretary of Defense shall provide 
all members of the United States Armed 
Forces who were deployed in support of the 
Global War on Terror with a $2,500 bonus to 
recognize that these Americans have served 
in the Global War On Terrorism exclusively 
on a volunteer basis and to demonstrate the 
heartfelt gratitude of our Nation. 
(d) REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF 
MILITARY FORCE.—The Authorization for Use 
of Military Force (Public Law 107–40) is re-
pealed effective on the earlier of— 
(1) the date that is 395 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act: or 
(2) the date on which the Secretary of De-
fense certifies that all United States Armed 
Forces involved in operations or military ac-
tions in Afghanistan (as described in sub-
section (b)(1)(A)) have departed from Afghan-
istan. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as I said 
earlier, I will move to table the Paul 
amendment at 5:30 today, and Senators 
should expect a rollcall vote at that 
time. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4115 
July 1, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Con-
gress has taken action in response to 
the coronavirus pandemic and its sig-
nificant effects on workers, families, 
and the economy. It is because the 
State, Federal, and local governments 
shut down the U.S. economy for the 
first time in the 240-year history of our 
country. 
We enacted four laws in March and 
April, which CBO says has increased 
the deficit by at least $2.4 trillion, but 
that doesn’t measure the entirety of 
the relief. If you add in support from 
programs initiated by the Fed and the 
Treasury, you would add trillions more 
of relief. 
One of the recent pieces of legisla-
tion, the CARES Act, devoted $150 bil-
lion of direct Federal relief to govern-
ments of the States, localities, terri-
tories, the District of Columbia, and 
Tribes. That is around 16 percent of the 
total fiscal year 2020 State general fund 
expenditures enacted prior to the pub-
lic emergency. 
In addition to the $150 billion, CBO 
has identified hundreds of billions 
more from the various relief programs 
that are directed to State and local 
governments. From the $340 billion of 
emergency funding in the CARES Act 
alone, the Senate appropriators have 
told me that more than 80 percent, or 
roughly $275 billion, goes to States and 
localities. 
So, you can see, the CARES Act 
alone provided $150 billion of direct aid 
to State and local governments, and 
the emergency funding added $275 bil-
lion. That means that $425 billion in 
the CARES Act is directed to govern-
ments of the States, localities, terri-
tories, Tribes, and the District of Co-
lumbia. That happens to be 47 percent 
of the total State general revenue ex-
penditures enacted prior to the public 
emergency for fiscal year 2020 and 
about the same percentage of enacted 
total State revenue. 
On top of that, the Fed has allowed 
use of municipal securities as collat-
eral for bank lending to help ease bor-
rowing costs for local and State gov-
ernments. Treasury and the Fed also 
established a Municipal Liquidity Fa-
cility. The purpose of it is to ‘‘help 
state and local governments better 
manage cash flow pressures.’’ 
The Fed will buy up to $500 billion of 
debt from State, counties, and cities. 
As others have noted here on this very 
floor, a significant amount of the fund-
ing directed to States and localities 
and the like are still in the pipeline 
and 
remain 
unspent 
or 
even 
unallocated. Some States, as I under-
stand it, have not even allocated any 
money downstream to their own local 
governments from the $150 billion of di-
rect aid provided under the CARES 
Act. 
Despite all that, we have heard a 
number of calls for massive amounts of 
additional spending. The reason, ac-
cording to most people asking for 
more, is that the direct aid for States 
and localities in the CARES Act is too 
restrictive and cannot be used to re-
place lost revenue. I am sympathetic to 
the idea of giving States and localities 
more flexibility in how to use $150 bil-
lion of direct relief provided in the 
CARES Act if it is not needed for the 
virus health issues. Beyond that, I 
want you to know I am more skeptical, 
until we get more solid numbers on un-
realized State and local revenue and 
the impact of the CARES dollars not 
yet allowed. 
I recently heard the minority leader 
here on the floor attempting to scold 
us Republicans for not doing exactly 
what he wants, exactly when he wants 
it, and saying we need to immediately 
spend more, including more direct aid 
to States. Of course, in his partisan po-
litical 
analysis, 
Republicans 
are 
blamed 
for 
not 
wanting 
massive 
amounts of additional aid for State and 
local governments because what he be-
lieves is ideological opposition to gov-
ernment in general. 
Now, that is quite a stretch, even for 
the minority leader. Republicans sup-
ported four pieces of legislation in re-
cent months providing hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in relief to State and 
local governments in various ways. 
I heard the Governor of California in-
struct Congress on moral and ethical 
grounds, saying that it is our duty to 
give more funding to States and local-
ities or else first responders will be the 
first ones laid off by cities and coun-
ties. It is almost like the first argu-
ment when we were just about ready to 
shut down the Federal Government, if 
we don’t finance everything, first thing 
we are going to do is shut down the 
Washington Monument. 
While that may have been a subtle 
threat from the Governor of California 
to use as leverage to pressure Congress 
to provide more funds to California, it 
is unfortunate that State and local 
governments laid off so many of their 
workers in recent months. That doesn’t 
seem to be much dedication by govern-
ment to its workforce. 
I heard from associations of Gov-
ernors, associations of counties, cities, 
and other municipal governments that 
they need between a half a trillion and 
a trillion more in direct aid from the 
Federal Government. Usually, they 
cite a need to ‘‘replace lost revenue.’’ 
Many have asked for funds to cover 
lost revenue as far out as two addi-
tional fiscal years beyond fiscal year 
2020. Most of those requests are based 
on forecasts of what the pandemic and 
the economy will look like for the rest 
of the year and even in coming years. 
I think you have to take those fore-
casts with a grain of salt. Just look at 
what 
the 
last 
employment 
report 
looked like relative to the forecasts, 
and you can tell how cloudy people’s 
crystal balls are right now. 
I heard from some here on the floor 
that Moody’s thinks States and local-
ities may need hundreds of billions 
more in direct relief. People haven’t 
been very careful, though, in reading 
the Moody’s reports that are the basis 
of their arguments. 
Moody’s 
Analytics, 
which 
makes 
very clear in the report that it is not 
an arm of Moody’s that rates bonds— 
though, I am not sure everyone is clear 
on that—Moody’s Analytics said in 
April that under their most severely 
adverse assumptions about the future, 
State and local governments would 
have a budget shortfall of around $172 
billion over the next 15 months and 
more than $450 billion if you extend out 
to cover the years 2022. 
Again, this is all based on shaky fore-
casts, and it is not at all clear that the 
ratings on municipal bonds done by the 
Moody’s ratings agency align with the 
forecasts of Moody’s Analytics. 
More recently, Moody’s Analytics’ 
chief economist, Mark Zandi, who is a 
regular proponent of Keynesian stim-
ulus for the Democratic Party, upped 
the estimate of the needs to about $500 
billion. 
That 
number 
remarkably 
matches what we heard from the Na-
tional Governors Association about 6 
weeks ago. Dr. Zandi promises so- 
called bang-for-the-buck magic to save 
States and localities, but the govern-
ment will have to pony up perhaps a 
half a trillion more just to start that 
magic. So I am skeptical, to put it 
mildly. 
If you remember, it was that kind of 
reasoning that led to the Obama stim-
ulus promising vague and relatively 
quick unemployment deductions fol-
lowing the financial crisis but failed to 
come even close to these promised re-
sults. 
Finally, regarding funding requests, 
there is the Heroes Act over at the 
House. State and local aid in that act 
provides nearly $1 trillion to States 
and localities inside a liberal wish list 
in their bill. 
That, along with what we have al-
ready done, would put State and local 
relief at more than 75 percent of all 
combined State and local tax collec-
tions for a year, depending how you 
measure things. That is more of a Fed-
eral bailout than the partnership that 
we are asked to finance. 
I have heard a lot of calls for massive 
amounts of additional direct aid to our 
States, funded by Federal debt. Yet 
there still is a lot of money in the pipe-
line that hasn’t even been used yet. 
And future needs of States and local-
ities are highly uncertain—too uncer-
tain, in my view—to commit the Fed-
eral Government today to half a tril-
lion dollars or $1 trillion more to 
States and localities, on top of the $425 
billion or more of funding already in 
play and up to $500 billion of credit 
support. 
I am highly skeptical of schemes to 
index future aid to measures of the in-
cidence of COVID–19 cases, since we al-
ready have had controversies sur-
rounding those measures, and some of 
them are political controversies. 
Of course, I do understand budget 
rules that States and localities operate

under. They do provide constraints. I 
also believe that proponents of massive 
amounts of additional Federal aid to 
States and localities overstate the se-
verity of those constraints. I think 
State budgets are more flexible and 
fungible, for example, than some would 
have us believe. 
We have seen that flexibility re-
cently in legislators’ consideration of 
altering police funding or using tax-
payers’ funds to erect barriers in occu-
pied zones of lawlessness as just one ex-
ample of that flexibility. 
There are also many issues about in-
centives associated with massive new 
amounts of direct Federal funding of 
State and local governments. Sending 
massive amounts of additional Federal 
funds to States that were responsible 
in good times and built up rainy day 
funds means that they are treated the 
same as States that didn’t build much, 
if any, in rainy day funds, as I said, Il-
linois and New Jersey, for examples. 
Those States that acted irresponsibly 
then get rewarded. 
Since funds in State and local gov-
ernments are fungible, sending massive 
amounts of additional Federal dollars 
to States and localities means that 
hard-earned Federal tax dollars coming 
from Iowa, as an example, can end up 
helping financially unsustainable pen-
sion promises of fiscally irresponsible 
States, and it means that Federal tax 
revenues get channeled to States run 
by politicians who will not even en-
force existing Federal laws and who use 
taxpayer resources on lawless occupied 
zones or sanctuary cities to provide 
benefits to undocumented residents. 
There are many of my constituents in 
Iowa who do not support those uses of 
Federal funds. 
So, as I wind down here, I am highly 
skeptical of sending massive amounts 
of additional funds to States and local-
ities, since future needs are so highly 
uncertain and there is still unspent 
money in the pipelines. 
I am, however, sympathetic to pro-
viding additional flexibility for funds 
we 
have 
already 
provided 
in 
the 
CARES Act so that State and local 
communities can make broader uses of 
those funds. And I believe that if the 
pandemic and the economy worsens, 
under 
those 
circumstances, 
future 
needs can be addressed when needed. 
I understand that there are a range of 
views regarding additional funds for 
States and localities. At this point, I 
believe it may be useful to entertain 
more flexibility in what has already 
been approved, and there may be a need 
to make sure that States get shares of 
money they have received to counties 
and cities. There may even be a rea-
soned case for limited additional fund-
ing to States and localities in the near 
term, although, as I said, I am a bit 
skeptical. 
But approving half a trillion dollars 
to $1 trillion of additional funds for un-
certain future needs right now to cover 
unknown State and local needs as far 
out as 2 years down the road just isn’t 
the responsible or prudent action to 
take. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that I be allowed to 
complete my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2011 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, Senator 
UDALL and I are pleased to present a bi-
partisan amendment that will finally 
end America’s longest war. Our amend-
ment will finally and completely end 
the war in Afghanistan. 
Over 4,000 Americans have died in Af-
ghanistan, and over 20,000 have been 
wounded. It is time to bring our sol-
diers home. 
I supported going into Afghanistan 
originally. Had I been in Congress at 
that time, I would have voted in favor 
of it. But the people who attacked us 
on 9/11 have all been killed or captured. 
Most of the people fighting us today 
are their successors or children or the 
children of their children. In fact, we 
now have soldiers who were born after 
9/11 serving in Afghanistan. 
The cycle shows no sign of ending. 
The war shows no sign of ending. It is 
not sustainable to keep fighting in Af-
ghanistan generation after generation. 
We have been fighting in Afghanistan 
for so long that our youngest soldiers 
fighting there weren’t even born at the 
time. 
We have spent about $1 trillion to es-
tablish an Afghan Government—a gov-
ernment that is rife with corruption 
and dysfunction. We spent more to re-
build Afghanistan than the Marshall 
Plan to rebuild Europe after World War 
II. We have built infrastructure in Af-
ghanistan and then watched it deterio-
rate and watched the Afghans be un-
able to even maintain the infrastruc-
ture we built for them, and then they 
ask us for more money to maintain the 
structure. Meanwhile, our roads and 
our bridges crumble here at home as we 
rebuild the infrastructure in Afghani-
stan. 
One example is, several years ago, we 
reportedly hired a local security con-
sultant to help secure the roads at a 
cost of $1 million per year. But accord-
ing to the report by the Special Inspec-
tor General for Afghanistan Recon-
struction, American officials came to 
suspect that the money was being fun-
neled to insurgents to stage attacks on 
our infrastructure to justify the secu-
rity contract. So our money was going 
to a guy who was paying insurgents to 
pretend to attack him so he could pro-
vide security for their infrastructure. 
It is crazy. 
We spent $43 million on a natural gas 
gas station. Guess how many vehicles 
in Afghanistan run on natural gas. 
Zero. You can’t even find the gas sta-
tion. My staff went there to see if the 
money 
had 
been 
spent, 
and 
they 
couldn’t go there because it was too 
unsafe. Now the report is that the gas 
station has been abandoned—$43 mil-
lion. 
We spent nearly $80 million on a lux-
ury hotel. Why is the American tax-
payer building luxury hotels in Kabul? 
Guess what. A contractor ran off with 
the money. It is a skeleton. The 
Taliban are now said to climb up into 
the structure and shoot down at our 
Embassy. What kind of foolhardy na-
ture of government are we that we con-
tinue to stay there? 
These are just a few of the many ex-
amples that have had us spend more 
than we spent in Europe on the Mar-
shall Plan. 
We continue to pour good money 
after bad into Afghanistan, hoping that 
the outcome will somehow change, 
hoping that maybe the first 20 years 
will produce better results than the 
last 20 years did. 
This NDAA, this defense authoriza-
tion that we are debating here in the 
Senate, even has the sense of the Sen-
ate in it opposing a precipitous with-
drawal from Afghanistan. We have been 
there for 20 years. How can we charac-
terize withdrawal after 20 years, after 
we defeated the enemy, as precipitous? 
It is crazy. The American people say 
‘‘Come home,’’ and this is your chance. 
Many people have said that we 
should end the war. Today, you get to 
vote. Are you for staying in Afghani-
stan for another generation? Are you 
for continuing a war that has lost its 
purpose? Today, we get to vote up or 
down: Are you for the war or against 
the war? Does the war still have a mis-
sion? 
The American people know better. 
They are ready to declare victory and 
come 
home. 
It 
is 
why 
President 
Trump’s message resonated with so 
many. He said ‘‘It is time to come 
home,’’ and the people agreed. 
Not only is it time to end the war 
and focus on our needs at home, but it 
is time to reward those who fought the 
battle. We are spending $50 billion a 
year over there. 
From the savings in the first year, in 
our amendment, Senator UDALL and I 
will provide a $2,500 bonus for anyone 
who has been deployed in the long War 
on Terror. That is a pretty good bonus. 
Our soldiers deserve it, and they also 
deserve to come home because there is 
no military mission left. 
Instead of spending another $50 bil-
lion in Afghanistan next year, let’s 
give some of that money to our soldiers 
who fought the war, and let’s begin 
saving some money from the massive 
deficit we face here at home. 
This is the Senate’s chance to show 
that it is time to declare victory. It is 
time to come home. 
I urge support for my amendment, 
and I also remind Senators this is your 
chance to vote to end a war.

ator from New Mexico.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4117 
July 1, 2020 
I would ask unanimous consent, as 
Senator PAUL did, to complete my re-
marks and unanimous consent to com-
plete my remarks right here on the 
floor before we have the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I am a 
strong supporter of the AFGHAN Serv-
ice Act, which I introduced with Sen-
ator PAUL. 
It has been nearly 19 years since the 
United States entered this war in Af-
ghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, and we 
have had several Presidents—one a 
Democrat, one a Republican—say they 
want to end this war. They announced: 
We don’t want endless wars. We want 
to end this war. 
Our current President has said he 
wanted to do this for the last 31⁄2 years. 
He hasn’t gotten it done. President 
Obama wanted to end it. 
This is the way—the responsible 
way—to end this war. We give a year 
timeframe. We make absolutely clear 
we are not against our American sol-
diers. We give them a bonus, and we 
say: You have done a good job. 
So don’t listen to the distortions that 
will be talked about what this amend-
ment is about. 
We have soldiers who are heading to 
fight in this war who weren’t even born 
when it began, and most of the soldiers 
I have talked to who have come home 
from Afghanistan believe we should be 
out of there. That is one of the most 
persuasive things I have seen. Several 
of those soldiers have been elected to 
the U.S. Congress and have spoken up 
very, very strongly about continuing 
our war in Afghanistan. 
It has been nearly 10 years since I 
first came to the Senate floor in 2010 to 
call for the withdrawal of U.S. combat 
forces from Afghanistan. We have ac-
complished our goal of routing al- 
Qaida and killing Osama Bin Laden. 
Those were two of the big things that 
were talked about originally when 
President Bush went in and basically 
said: We have these short-term objec-
tives, we are going to get them 
achieved, and then we are going to be 
out. 
We have achieved those objectives. 
There is no reason for delay and to con-
tinue this endless war. The longer we 
stay with an ill-defined mission, the 
greater the risk of a wider war in the 
region. Believe me, I listen to people 
back home. They don’t want a wider 
war. They want us to bring our troops 
home. 
The recent news that has gripped the 
Capitol only underscores that our men 
and women in Afghanistan remain in 
harm’s way. They should be brought 
home and focus on our core national 
security. 
After 19 years of war, peace in Af-
ghanistan will need to come from nego-
tiation, and the United States can and 
should continue to play a role in those 
diplomatic efforts. 
This legislation ends the U.S. in-
volvement in the war in a responsible 
way, with a yearlong timeframe. It 
also sunsets the 9/11 AUMF, which has 
been stretched beyond recognition to 
justify wars we never considered. 
Even to this day, some in this admin-
istration envision using the 2001 AUMF 
to justify a war with Iran rather than 
actually standing on the floor and in-
troducing a proposal, as required by 
the Constitution to get in a war, as is 
Congress’s authority. 
On the AUMF, this isn’t something 
sudden either; it would give Congress a 
year to consider a new AUMF, if need-
ed. 
It is long past time for Congress to 
make the difficult decision and stop 
ducking the votes on whether to send 
our troops into harm’s way. 
Finally, this amendment rewards the 
veterans of these wars. We owe a lot 
more to them, but this is a start. 
I hope you will join me in supporting 
the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan 
and support the restoration of congres-
sional war-making authority and vote 
against tabling this amendment. This 
amendment deserves an up-or-down 
vote, not a tabling vote, so vote no to 
tabling this amendment. I say this in 
great respect to Senator INHOFE, and I 
know that Senator INHOFE has been 
very courteous in terms of the time. 
At this point, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is 
another side to this story, and I think, 
when you hear those promoting this 
particular amendment, it is one we all 
agree—we want an end to the war. We 
want this to happen. But there are 
some other reasons that this probably 
is not the best way to do it. 
First of all, the amendment directs a 
calendar-based withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan rather than a conditions- 
based. We have talked about this quite 
often. It is something that you can’t 
just say ‘‘It is going to happen by this 
date’’ but, rather, under these certain 
circumstances. 
It undermines peace negotiations and 
the Trump administration’s Afghan 
strategy. He has talked about that pub-
licly. I think a lot of people agree with 
that. I do. 
It would also undermine the Feb-
ruary 2020 U.S. agreement with the 
Taliban that tries to map out a path to 
peace. According to the plan, U.S. 
forces’ reductions must be tied to 
Taliban 
counterterrorism 
commit-
ments. That is part of the plan. 
Repealing it—the 2001 authorization 
for use of military force—would under-
mine the authority of the President of 
the United States for countering ter-
rorists in Afghanistan but also would 
undermine the GITMO detention and 
other global counterterrorist efforts. 
The DOD and the White House would 
oppose this because it removes an au-
thority for using military force and 
would significantly undermine coun-
terterrorism authority. 
So I move to table the Paul amend-
ment No. 2011, and I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll.

Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. MAR-
KEY), and the Senator from Washington

COVID–19 INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE AND 
RECOVERY ACT OF 2020 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak to S. 3669, the COVID–19 
International Response and Recovery 
Act of 2020. 
As of this weekend, there are an esti-
mated 10 million confirmed cases of 
COVID–19 worldwide. More than 2.5 
million of those cases are right here in 
the United States. The disease has 
claimed over 125,000 American lives. 
For anyone who questioned why we 
should care about what happens else-
where in the world, this pandemic has 
certainly been most assuredly a wake-

July 1, 2020 
up call. The virus didn’t start here, but 
it came here and Americans are now 
suffering from the effects of an epi-
demic that shows no signs of stopping. 
Even if we bring it under control in 
the United States, in the absence of 
U.S. leadership for a truly global re-
sponse, the virus can and will return. 
We cannot safeguard American lives 
without one, but we cannot lead or 
even meaningfully participate in a 
global response when we don’t have a 
coherent and effective domestic strat-
egy. 
The President’s desperate denial, his 
refusal to take this pandemic seri-
ously, and his seeming inability to care 
about the health and well-being of all 
Americans are as shocking as they are 
dangerous. 
As opposed to a pandemic response 
strategy, the White House seems to 
have 
a 
dangerous 
public 
relations 
strategy focused on perpetuating a 
false narrative that insists the pan-
demic is almost over, blames China and 
the World Health Organization for its 
own preparedness and response fail-
ures, overstates the administration’s 
domestic and international response, 
and refuses to be candid with Congress 
and the American people about the 
consequences of its irresponsible ac-
tions. 
Make no mistake, contrary to what 
the White House would have us believe, 
the COVID–19 threat is far from over. 
As Dr. Anthony Fauci testified, it is a 
lack of serious response—not as some 
in the White House would have us be-
lieve, more tests—that is leading to the 
skyrocketing case numbers and hos-
pitalization rates we are seeing today. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
haphazardness 
that 
has 
characterized 
the 
White 
House’s response at home has also 
shaped its response abroad. 
Secretary 
Pompeo 
is 
right. 
The 
American people are the most generous 
on the planet, but that belies this ad-
ministration’s actual response. The re-
ality is that when it comes to discus-
sions about what it is doing to end the 
pandemic globally, the administration 
is trumpeting programs it has spent 3 
years consistently and aggressively 
cutting, which explains perfectly why 
Secretary Pompeo, to this day, refuses 
to come before the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee to defend his pro-
posed fiscal year 2021 budget. 
America, the world needs a strategy 
to end this pandemic, not a PR blitz to 
cover inaction. The blame game will 
not help us either. Yet, instead of tak-
ing care of the business at hand, the 
administration is channeling its energy 
toward fault finding and divisive, ra-
cially inflammatory rhetoric. 
First, the White House tried to say 
that the U.S. epidemic was the World 
Health Organization’s fault, despite the 
fact that the United States was regu-
larly communicating with and receiv-
ing information from the WHO, includ-
ing through U.S. Government employ-
ees embedded at the WHO headquarters 
in Geneva. 
In 
May, 
the 
administration 
an-
nounced a 30-day plan to review the or-
ganization’s handling of the pandemic 
response. But less than 2 weeks after it 
announced 
that 
sham 
review, 
the 
President said he was going to with-
draw from the organization—so much 
for the 30-day review. 
Next, the administration doubled 
down on blaming China. The President, 
the Secretary of State, and the Deputy 
Administrator of USAID have all used 
racially stigmatizing language to de-
scribe COVID–19, in direct contradic-
tion to guidance issued by our own 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention. And the insistence that the 
rest of the world agree to use such lan-
guage has prevented us from reaching 
consensus on statements at the G–7 and 
in the U.N. Security Council and seri-
ously weakened our standing. 
If this administration is truly con-
cerned about China’s malign intent at 
the WHO and elsewhere, there is a sim-
ple answer: Take action. If the United 
States leads, others will follow. If we 
leave the field open, others, like China, 
will step into the vacuum. 
Isolationist, go-it-alone tactics are 
not the way to end a pandemic. At a 
time when the United States should be 
leading the global response to one of 
the greatest threats we face in the 21st 
century—and this pandemic will, most 
certainly, not be our last—I have to 
wonder if, instead, what we are wit-
nessing is the death of American lead-
ership 
and 
the 
end 
of 
American 
exceptionalism, brought about by the 
inattention 
and 
ineptitude 
of 
the 
Trump administration, both here and 
abroad. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the world is 
stepping up and stepping past us. For 
example, when Chinese President Xi 
Jinping addressed the World Health As-
sembly in May, he pledged $2 billion 
over 2 years to combat COVID–19. Sec-
retary Azar used the opportunity to at-
tack the WHO and cast blame on China 
for the pandemic. 
The European Union held a pledging 
conference on vaccines in May, at 
which $8.2 billion was raised. The 
United States was invited to partici-
pate, but the White House declined the 
invitation. Is this what the President 
means by ‘‘America first’’? 
Well, if this EU consortium comes up 
with a vaccine before we do, it will 
mean America last, as we wait for 
them to share it with us. 
This approach is not only isola-
tionist, shortsighted, and foolish; it is 
dangerous. 
It is clear that the administration’s 
response is not keeping the American 
people safe, and it is just as clear that 
there are actions we can take to effec-
tively respond to this pandemic and 
better prepare for future pandemics. 
Since 
the 
administration 
doesn’t 
seem to have any ideas, Democrats on 
the Foreign Relations Committee in-
troduced a bill to provide some. S. 3669, 
the COVID–19 International Response 
and Recovery Act, or CIRRA, presents 
a clear strategy to confront the ongo-
ing pandemic—the ongoing pandemic— 
and prepare the United States to deal 
with the next. 
It compels the Trump administration 
to constructively engage with other 
countries, international organizations, 
and multilateral fora to stop the 
spread of the coronavirus. 
Specifically, our bill authorizes an 
additional $9 billion in funding to fight 
the COVID–19 pandemic through con-
tributions toward vaccine research at 
the Coalition for Preparedness and In-
novations; a contribution to the Global 
Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis, and Ma-
laria, for its COVID–19 response mecha-
nism; additional funding for emergency 
overseas humanitarian assistance in 
response to the pandemic, ensuring 
that these funds are provided both to 
the U.N. for its global response plan, as 
well as directly to NGOs working on 
the frontlines; and a new surge financ-
ing authority at the U.S. International 
Development Finance Corporation, or 
DFC, that will allow the DFC to expe-
dite decisions and make strategic in-
vestments quickly to aid in COVID–19 
reconstruction efforts. 
CIRRA also puts in place mecha-
nisms to help us prepare for the next 
pandemic. It requires an annual na-
tional intelligence estimate on pan-
demic threats, and it establishes a 
White House adviser for global health 
security to coordinate a whole-of-gov-
ernment U.S. response to global health 
security emergencies, aimed at improv-
ing both domestic and international 
capacity to prevent, respond, and de-
tect epidemic and pandemic threats. 
It clearly delineates the roles for the 
State Department, USAID, and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention in responding to pandemic 
threats, and it directs the U.S. Execu-
tive Director at the World Bank to 
begin negotiations to establish a trust 
fund at the World Bank designed not to 
compete with or supplant the World 
Health Organization but to work in 
tandem with the WHO on incentivizing 
countries to mobilize their own re-
sources for epidemic and pandemic pre-
paredness. 
Now, my Republican colleague on the 
Foreign Relations Committee finally 
did introduce a modest bill in response 
to the pandemic. In keeping with the 
Republican effort to pretend that the 
pandemic is over, it completely ignores 
the current crisis. 
Instead, it focuses on giving legisla-
tive cover to elite proposals from the 
White House that seem to strip essen-
tial pandemic response functions from 
USAID and put them in the State De-
partment, and sets up a structure at 
the World Bank that would allow the 
White House to channel funding meant 
for the WHO into another multilateral 
mechanism. 
Colleagues, to say that that approach 
is inadequate to meet the crisis of the 
century would be so much of an under-
statement as to almost be a lie in and 
of itself. The chairman’s legislation

S4119 
July 1, 2020 
completely ignores the current pan-
demic while setting us up for failure 
when we are confronted by the next 
pandemic. We quite simply must do 
better. 
More than 700 Americans a day are 
dying. 
Neither 
the 
finger-pointing, 
blame-game, race-baiting statements 
linked to the origins of the disease, nor 
a strategy centered on denial will win 
the battle against COVID–19. 
It is painfully apparently that Con-
gress will have to lead in this effort, 
just as it led in domestic relief and re-
covery efforts. If we fail to develop a 
proposal that boldly and robustly ad-
dresses the current crisis, ensures that 
we are adequately prepared for the 
next one, and aids countries around the 
globe with recovery, we will have failed 
the American people and fallen pain-
fully short of the legacy created 
through initiatives such as the Presi-
dent’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
and the Marshall plan, to name a few. 
We must understand that there is a 
recent report that came out of a poten-
tial swine flu. Well, whether it is that 
or something else, we have the risk of 
the next pandemic. Our engagement 
globally is not just about being a good 
global citizen. It is about security and 
health here at home. 
When we can engage abroad to stop 
the flow of a virus, then, we ultimately 
achieve the success on behalf of the 
American people, and we leave the 
world with a better response. That is 
what we are seeking to do, and we will 
come back to the floor at the appro-
priate time to seek to move that legis-
lation. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5084 
Madam President, turning to a dif-
ferent topic for the moment, one that 
my colleague from Louisiana is also 
here to join me in—and I appreciate his 
being here—I come to the floor today, 
in addition to speaking about the 
COVID–19 international legislation, to 
seek unanimous consent on H.R. 5084, 
the Improving Corporate Governance 
Through Diversity Act of 2019. 
This is a bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion aimed at increasing transparency 
in America’s corporate boardrooms and 
ultimately lead to greater diversity in 
the upper tiers of America’s companies. 
We know that corporate America has 
a diversity problem. Boards and execu-
tive offices across the United States do 
not look like the customers they serve. 
Multiple studies, including my own, 
have demonstrated this hard fact. 
Since 2010, I have conducted four sur-
veys focused on the Fortune 100 compa-
nies looking into this problem. They 
had very big response rates, for which 
I am grateful to the companies who 
participated. 
My latest survey revealed that since 
2010, women and people of color have 
made only marginal gains in represen-
tations on corporate boards. For exam-
ple, in 2018, women held only 25 percent 
of corporate board seats on Fortune 100 
companies. Despite making up over 
half of the entire U.S. population, they 
held only 25 percent of corporate board 
seats, and only 5.8 percent of that 25 
percent were women of color. While 
men make up 75 percent of Fortune 100 
corporate board seats, only 13.7 percent 
of those are men of color. 
If we wanted to take a broader look, 
the picture is even bleaker. Latinos 
and Latinas make up 25 percent of the 
U.S. population, yet they held only 2.7 
percent of corporate board seats in 
Fortune 100 companies. I could go on, 
but I think I have made the point. 
I was originally hopeful that the Se-
curities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission 
would 
help 
address 
this 
problem 
through its 2009 diversity disclosure 
rule, but the 2009 rule failed to even de-
fine diversity and gives companies far 
too much discretion on what they re-
port. That is why I introduced a bill 
last year with Representative MEEKS 
to improve the SEC rule. 
The bill does three main things. No. 
1, it requires public companies to dis-
close specific information related to 
the racial, gender, ethnic makeup and 
veteran status of corporate boards and 
senior management—simple disclosure. 
No. 2, it requires public companies to 
disclose whether they have policies in 
place to promote diversity in their 
leadership. No. 3, it requires the SEC to 
establish a diversity advisory group 
composed of government, academic, 
and private sector representatives to 
study strategies for increasing gender, 
racial, and ethnic diversity in cor-
porate America. 
Let me be clear. The bill does not 
force companies to be more diverse, 
but it does require them to be more 
transparent about their numbers and 
their practices. That is valuable infor-
mation that the public and potential 
investors should have when deciding 
where to put their money. 
The House passed this bill on a bipar-
tisan vote in November, and it enjoys 
bipartisan support here in the Senate. 
It is supported by a fantastic coalition 
that includes the NAACP, the National 
Urban League, the Latino Corporate 
Directors Association, and the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Corporate diversity is not just mor-
ally right; corporate diversity makes 
financial sense. McKinsey & Company 
studies have consistently found that 
greater diversity on executive teams 
has led to greater profitability. The 
need for increased corporate diversity 
is not an act of benevolence; it is a ne-
cessity for businesses looking to com-
pete in a diverse 21st century economy. 
Before I proceed to my unanimous 
consent request, I would like to yield 
to Senator KENNEDY for some remarks 
he has on this issue, and then I will 
proceed to that consent request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, thank 
you to my colleague from New Jersey 
for yielding me some time. 
I sit on the Banking Committee with 
Senator MENENDEZ, and it is my privi-
lege. I have learned a lot from listening 
to him, along with our chairman, Sen-
ator CRAPO. 
While convictions are important to 
us on the Banking Committee, so is 
data. I believe that as much as we can 
be, America is and should be a color-
blind meritocracy. I believe in that. 
I also believe in data. I believe in 
facts. This is a data bill. This is a fact 
bill. This doesn’t make anybody do 
anything except be transparent. 
This bill applies to public companies. 
Some may call them Wall Street com-
panies, but they are spread throughout 
America. I make that point simply to 
reaffirm that this does not apply to 
small, publicly held companies we 
sometimes call Main Street businesses. 
This bill is endorsed by the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. This fact and 
data bill passed overwhelmingly in the 
House with a bipartisan coalition, and 
as Senator MENENDEZ eloquently point-
ed out, it simply requires public—usu-
ally large, but not always—publicly 
held corporations to report data with 
respect to their Board of Directors, 
nominees to the Board of Directors, 
and their executive officers. 
The data that these companies are 
being asked to report is data with re-
spect to gender, data with respect to 
veteran status, data with respect to 
ethnicity, and data with respect to 
race to the extent that the board mem-
bers, nominees, and the executive offi-
cers themselves report that data. 
Frankly, and I will end on this note, 
I was very surprised that we didn’t 
have this data. In fact, when I first 
read Congressman MEEKS’ bill and Sen-
ator MENENDEZ’s bill, I thought: This 
can’t be necessary; we must have this 
data at the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. We do not, but we will if 
this bill becomes law. For that reason, 
I rise in support of Congressman 
MEEKS’ legislation and Senator MENEN-
DEZ’s legislation, and I support it. 
With that, I would yield to Senator 
MENENDEZ. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator 
from Louisiana for his words and for 
his support, and I wish we had this al-
ready. It is not very difficult—trans-
parency, information for which con-
sumers can make decisions and inves-
tors can make decisions, and you would 
think in the 21st Century, that is not a 
problem. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration and 
the Senate proceed to H.R. 5084; I fur-
ther ask unanimous consent that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah.

the right to object, the purpose of the

S4120 
July 1, 2020 
is to protect investors and to maintain 
orderly and efficient markets. This bill 
would change that deal. It would 
change the entire premise of the SEC. 
It would use the SEC to pressure people 
to disclose personal information that 
has no connection to the financial 
health of the company, information 
that many people understandably, jus-
tifiably, and with really good reason 
prefer to keep private. Why? Because it 
is not the public’s business; it is theirs. 
The bill requires businesses to probe 
the race, gender, ethnicity, and veteran 
status of not only those already on the 
senior payroll of their companies but 
also anyone who is even considered for 
those positions. 
Secondly, the free market already 
provides a way to achieve these goals. 
If investors prefer to invest in compa-
nies that have certain kinds of people 
on their boards and certain kinds of 
people in executive positions, then 
companies have a financial incentive 
to disclose that information. No one is 
stopping them from doing that. Many 
companies do, in fact, disclose that in-
formation. Many companies are al-
ready providing this information be-
cause their customers and their inves-
tors are demanding it. 
Government is neither omniscient 
nor omnipotent. It is not a deity. It is 
just force. It is just organized, collec-
tive official force. That is all it is. We 
should not use the heavy hand of gov-
ernment for things that the American 
people already have the opportunity to 
do on their own and in many, if not 
most, cases already are doing on their 
own. 
Finally, the bill co-ops Federal em-
ployees at the SEC to create a diver-
sity advisory group of government bu-
reaucrats and academics who would ad-
vise Congress on policies to increase 
ethnic and gender diversity on cor-
porate boards. 
We already have a diversity advisory 
group. We already have it. It is the mil-
lions of Americans whom we represent. 
To think that bureaucrats at the SEC 
could inform Congress of the impor-
tance of inclusion and diversity better 
than the American people is wasteful, 
and to think that it is appropriate to 
vest in the SEC an entity designed to 
protect investors from fraudulent ac-
tivities of those running these enter-
prises is just the wrong conception, not 
only of the SEC but of government in 
general. 
For these reasons, Mr. President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I am not surprised, 
but I am deeply disappointed that my 
colleague takes that position. First of 
all, the SEC has had a diversity rule 
since 2009. It has a diversity rule, but 
the diversity rule as they devised it 
doesn’t 
do 
anything 
about 
trans-
parency of information. So we are not 
creating something at the SEC that 
the SEC itself wasn’t pursuing in the 
protection of investors. 
If I were an investor, I would like to 
know whether a company is diverse or 
not. Latinos represent 25 percent of the 
population, the fastest growing, largest 
minority in the Nation. I would like to 
know if the money I am going to put 
into a stock—buying a stock of a com-
pany—does it reflect the understanding 
of that community in any way? African 
Americans—does it reflect that under-
standing? Does it reflect the under-
standing that 50 percent of the popu-
lation are women? 
The free market—yes, the free mar-
ket works on information. You make 
decisions in the free market based on 
information, but when the information 
is hidden from you, when you can’t find 
out, in fact, what is the diversity of the 
corporate board, senior executive man-
agement, 
procurement 
and 
other 
things, then the free market doesn’t 
work very well, does it? 
The heavy hand of government—oh, 
my God—to disclose, to be trans-
parent—that is the heavy hand of gov-
ernment? 
When 
the 
government 
doesn’t work to make our systems 
more transparent so that investors and 
consumers can make decisions, who 
will do that? The free market? I don’t 
think so. 
The Senator from Utah, I know, has 
been very much an advocate of trans-
parency in other matters; somehow, in 
this one, it seems to be a problem. And 
to protect investors—yes, we ought to 
protect investors because investors 
who would be making investments in a 
company that is devoid of African 
Americans, devoid of Latinos, devoid of 
the representation of who America is 
today may think twice about the large 
pension funds and other entities. They 
may say: Wait a minute. Maybe that is 
not the type of company I want to in-
vest in. 
But the investor will not know that 
unless they have that information. I 
would think, in the 21st century, when 
we see the national debate that is tak-
ing place today on the questions of 
race, on questions of ethnicity and 
other things, we would want to at least 
have the data so that we can make in-
telligent decisions. 
By the way, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce—the Chamber of Commerce 
is normally not on my side. They came 
and testified specifically in support of 
this provision. They represent business 
in America, and they came forth and 
said: We believe that, in fact, this is 
good for business. If it weren’t good for 
business, they wouldn’t be there. They 
wouldn’t be advocating for it. 
So we will succeed at this. We may 
not have done it today by this process, 
but we will succeed at this because the 
Nation requires it. It is good account-
ability. It is good transparency. It is good for 
the free market to know what the informa-
tion is so people can make decisions. It is 
certainly, at the end of the day, about pro-
tecting investors. So I look forward to mak-
ing that happen at the appropriate time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have deep 
affection and adoration for my friend 
and colleague, the Senator from New 
Jersey. I do respectfully but strongly 
disagree with his position on this. 
He made the point several times that 
if he were acting as an investor, he 
would very much like to know the 
composition of a corporate board or an 
executive team within a corporation, 
which is great. A lot of people feel the 
same way. That isn’t the question. No 
one is stopping a corporation from dis-
closing that information. In fact, a 
whole lot of corporations do. 
Some may not want to do that. Some 
might want to disclose some of this in-
formation but not all of it. Some might 
not want to be in a position of asking 
probing questions regarding the gender 
and ethnicity and race of their employ-
ees, understanding that it will then be 
disclosed to the public under the crush-
ing force of Federal law. 
There are legitimate reasons why a 
company might not want to do that, 
some of which have to do with that 
company’s own ability to treat its em-
ployees and its board members and its 
executive team with dignity and re-
spect. In some circumstances, not ev-
erything is the government’s business. 
Transparency, yes. It is absolutely 
something that I believe in. Trans-
parency usually refers to what we need 
when it comes to government action. 
Transparency is what we demand when 
we require open public hearings when 
government 
does 
business. 
Trans-
parency is what we require when we 
allow government documents to be 
made public and allow the public to see 
what the regulatory process is doing. 
Transparency doesn’t mean that ev-
erything that everyone does in Amer-
ica that has a tie to economic activity 
is the public’s business. The fact that 
it is publicly traded doesn’t mean it is 
owned by the government. 
So the statement made by my col-
league to the effect that when informa-
tion is hidden from you, then the free 
market doesn’t work very well—I don’t 
understand what that means. If what 
he is suggesting is that it is hidden in 
violation of law, that is not the case. If 
what he is suggesting is that the free 
market can’t punish those who refuse 
to 
disclose 
information 
about 
the 
boards and reward those who do, that is 
exactly what the free market does. The 
free market has every opportunity to 
work here. It is not as though nobody 
is providing this information, but it is 
not their business. 
As to the suggestion that because the 
Chamber of Commerce supports this, 
therefore it is pro-business, and be-
cause it is pro-business, we should all 
support it, I respectfully but strongly 
disagree. I know that as a Republican, 
I am supposed to automatically agree 
with what the Chamber of Commerce 
says. Sometimes I do, but, you know, a 
whole lot of the time, I don’t. 
This goes back a long time. It goes 
back to the time when the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce opposed a massive tax 
reform bill that was proposed by Presi-
dent Calvin Coolidge. I found some re-
lief in the fantastic, eponymous book

‘‘Coolidge’’ about President Coolidge 
and his proposal of that reform—a re-
form that, by the way, helped build 
America’s middle class and resulted in 
explosive economic growth. The U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce opposed that re-
form. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce gets 
a lot of things wrong, and it is wrong 
here. This isn’t the government’s busi-
ness. These businesses are not govern-
ment. They can do what they want, and 
it is not our place to say otherwise. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the intellectual exercise we 
are going through on the floor. I will 
just make two final comments because 
I know that my colleague is anxiously 
waiting to talk about the need for peo-
ple to be able to put food on the table. 
Look, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission exists, yes, to protect in-
vestors and also the marketplace, but 
they make all types of demands upon 
the companies that are publicly traded 
in terms of disclosure of information, 
so I don’t know what is so difficult 
about that. 
I will say this: The Nation will have 
a rude awakening if it thinks it can 
continue with business as usual—a 
rude awakening. 
Something as simple as simply know-
ing the information about diversity on 
corporate boards, which every study 
shows actually improves the bottom 
line and which investors should be able 
to have to make those decisions—and 
we are not talking about the employ-
ees; we are talking about the corporate 
board members, my God, the people 
who make billions of dollars of deci-
sions, who ultimately decide whether 
they go to a community or don’t go to 
a community to invest in, who ulti-
mately get the dollars from the com-
munities that I like to see represented. 
It is good enough to take our money, 
but it is not good enough to have us 
have any representation. And evidently 
this body is not even good enough to 
have the information so I know who is 
taking my money without representa-
tion. That cannot be. That cannot be 
the American way. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as my dis-
tinguished friend and colleague from 
New Jersey says, the fact that they 
make all types of demands on publicly 
traded companies is not a substitute 
for an actual logical or legal argument 
as to why they are entitled to informa-
tion that is not theirs—information 
these companies may or may not 
choose to collect because that is their 
business. It is not the government’s 
business, and it sure as heck isn’t the 
government. 
So the fact that they make all types 
of demands on publicly traded compa-
nies doesn’t prove the point here. We 
have to remember something, and, yes, 
we have to remember it right now in 
this moment—not in spite of this mo-
ment but because of it. Government is 
for. We have seen the catastrophic con-
sequences of people who lose sight of 
what government is for and what its 
limitations are. 
The fact is that we don’t have access 
to angels, as James Madison described 
it in Federalist 51. If men were angels, 
we wouldn’t have a need for govern-
ment. If we had access to angels to run 
our government, we wouldn’t need all 
these rules. But because we are not an-
gels, we don’t have access to them to 
run our government. We have to have 
rules, and there have to be limitations 
on what is and isn’t the role of govern-
ment. 
Now, look, there are all kinds of busi-
nesses that keep track of this informa-
tion on the corporate board members 
and those considered for those posi-
tions and their executives and those 
considered for those positions. It is not 
our role to tell them the information 
they have to extract from each and 
every person they interview for those 
positions and demand that it be pub-
licly disclosed. Why? Well, because, 
among other things, it is none of their 
darn business, and in many cases, it is 
none of ours. That is the business of 
the individual. 
We shouldn’t be punishing compa-
nies, 
businesses, 
and 
hard-working 
Americans. Yes, some of them are rich, 
and a whole lot of them are not rich. 
We shouldn’t be punishing them just 
because they don’t happen to share our 
view of how they ought to be oper-
ating. 
I find it curious that he says over and 
over again that this is how they will be 
more successful and this is how they 
will make more money. It is not our 
place to decide. They are free to oper-
ate their business in a foolish way and 
in a way that might cost them money. 
It doesn’t make it our place to decide 
this. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to be joined by my col-
leagues as well. I am very grateful to 
see the Senator from Ohio here. 
Thank you so much for being on the 
floor. 
Other colleagues will join to speak 
this evening on behalf of millions of 
American families who are struggling 
to make ends meet and feed their fami-
lies at this incredibly challenging 
time. 
The COVID–19 crisis is taking a pro-
found toll on our economy and the 
quality of life of millions of families. 
As businesses have closed and millions 
have lost their jobs, the number of peo-
ple in need of food assistance has 
soared. Food banks have seen a 70-per-
cent increase in demand—70 percent in-
crease in demand. We have all seen the 
photos of lines of families in cars 
stretching on and on for miles, waiting 
in parking lots with moms and dads, 
trying to get food for their children. 
And even though donations have gone 
up—we are a generous people in this 
country—donations have gone up, but 
the need has far outpaced the funds 
that are available. 
As the pandemic swept across our 
Nation, one in five adults experienced 
food insecurity—one in five. More than 
3 months later, even more Americans 
in every State are struggling to put 
food on the table. These are laid-off 
workers who lost their jobs due to the 
pandemic and aren’t sure they will be 
able to find employment. Many of them 
need food assistance, and it is for the 
first time in their life that they need 
to ask for that help. 
These are single moms and dads who 
are worried about getting their kids fed 
before they even think about them-
selves. 
These are veterans who are willing to 
put their lives on the line for the coun-
try. Now they are struggling to find 
work and make rent and just need a 
little extra help getting the food they 
need to survive. 
These are senior citizens who are at 
high risk of COVID–19 and have had to 
make drastic changes to their day-to- 
day life just to stay safe. 
These are children who relied on 
school meals for breakfast and lunch, 
possibly after school as well, who have 
gotten used to the pain of an empty 
stomach since their school closed. 
To these people, hunger is not a par-
tisan issue. It is not a political issue. 
For them, it is a daily reality that 
they face. For many of them, SNAP is 
the vital lifeline that keeps them fed in 
times of need, and today that need is 
even greater. If we are looking at the 
direction of COVID–19 and what is hap-
pening across the country, I am con-
cerned, but I think it is realistic to say 
that the need is going to go even high-
er. 
In any crisis, it is just common sense 
to make sure affected families have 
their basic needs met. When I think of 
my friend from Ohio, who is our cham-
pion on housing—we talked about 
housing as being a basic need. I don’t 
know anything more basic than a roof 
over your head and food on the table. 
Food and housing are pretty basic. We 
would all suggest that those are things 
that you start with and that you want 
for yourself and your family. 
When people’s lives are turned upside 
down through no fault of their own, 
Americans come together to provide a 
temporary safety net to help them get 
back on their feet. That is what the 
Supplemental 
Nutrition 
Assistance 
Program is, SNAP. It is not there for 
when folks don’t need it; it is there for 
when they do need it. 
During every past disaster, we have 
acted to make sure, as Americans, that 
people don’t go hungry. On a bipartisan 
basis, we have increased SNAP benefits 
when families are in need and in cases 
of natural and economic disasters, like 
after the 2008 financial crisis. 
I do note that my dear friend, the 
chairman of the Ag Committee—who I

July 1, 2020 
think is on a different side of what we 
are going to be asking for tonight—he 
and I have come together over and over 
again on a bipartisan basis and will 
continue to do that to work together 
on these issues. 
We provide additional help to people 
in need. That is the first thing we do. 
Yet we know that increasing SNAP 
benefits, in addition to helping people 
in need, should be No. 1. Put people 
first—that should be No. 1. 
The great news with SNAP is that it 
also boosts the economy. This is a 
twofer. According to the USDA, SNAP 
is one of the best investments we can 
make. For every dollar we put into 
SNAP benefits, when somebody walks 
into the grocery store and buys food, 
we see roughly $1.70 more in the econ-
omy. It is the most efficient way to 
help farmers and to help the food in-
dustry, is to allow people to have 
money to buy food for themselves and 
their kids and for their parents. 
We know that every additional bil-
lion dollars in SNAP supports nearly 
14,000 jobs. 
Usually families spend their benefits 
immediately, so it is very quick. I 
mean, you don’t spend a lot of time—if 
you are hungry, you are not going to be 
waiting a couple of weeks before you 
use your SNAP benefits; you are going 
to immediately go to the store. That is 
an immediate economic impact. 
When families buy food at grocery 
stores and markets, as I said, they are 
strengthening their local economies 
and the supply chain as a whole, from 
the farmers to the truckdrivers, to the 
stockers, to the cashiers, to the folks 
who invest in the stock markets. 
In fact, farmers understand better 
than anybody that families are their 
customers. That is why, when we write 
a bipartisan farm bill, which I am 
proud that we have been able to do, we 
make sure it helps both farmers and 
families. 
Farm bills are about a farmer safety 
net. Farmers need additional help right 
now. It is also about a family’s safety 
net, and families need help right now. 
Families across the country need help 
right now, and this time is no different. 
Nearly 2,500 farm and food advocates 
agree with that. In a letter to Senate 
leadership, these groups, including the 
National Council of Farmer Coopera-
tives, the National Milk Producers 
Federation, 
the 
National 
Farmers 
Union—thousands of organizations— 
have urged us to increase SNAP bene-
fits for families in need right now with 
what is happening right now in this 
crisis. 
We are asking for something very 
simple and very reasonable, a 15-per-
cent boost in SNAP benefits. This in-
crease means an additional $25 a month 
per person. That may not seem like 
much, unless you don’t have any food, 
unless you can’t feed your children, un-
less you are a senior, and you can’t get 
food. 
The fact is, it may mean that a mom 
can actually give her children some 
fruits and vegetables so they can stay 
healthy while they are staying at home 
through this crisis. It means maybe 
one less skipped meal at the end of the 
month. One less skipped meal, that is 
what we are talking about. 
This modest increase will help ensure 
that families most affected by the pan-
demic will be able to cover the cost of 
food while they stay safe, while they 
look for work, and while they rebuild 
their lives, which many families are 
needing to do. 
We also need to increase the min-
imum amount of SNAP from $16 to $30 
per day. Again, for all of us, that 
doesn’t seem like a lot. The reality is, 
this may be lifesaving—lifesaving—this 
difference, especially for our seniors 
who live alone. 
We must also waive the Trump ad-
ministration’s 
harmful 
regulations 
that will take food assistance away 
from hungry Americans when they 
need it the most. At a time when our 
neighbors and our economy are strug-
gling, it is unconscionable to move for-
ward with rules that would cut and 
deny benefits to millions of Americans, 
rules that would take away school 
meals from up to 1 million children. 
The Senate has the power to provide 
quick help to millions of people in 
every State across the country right 
now, right now. What a great way to 
spend a Wednesday evening to be able 
to help millions of families during this 
crisis. 
This is urgently needed. This is ur-
gently needed help for the millions of 
families who are wondering where their 
next meal is going to come from. This 
is urgently needed help for the millions 
of people who have lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own in this 
crisis. 
When an unprecedented emergency 
has put American lives and livelihoods 
in danger, we have an obligation to act. 
It is not only our sworn duty; it is the 
right thing to do. It is just, plainly, the 
right thing to do. 
Boosting SNAP benefits is a tried- 
and-true, effective way to strengthen 
the economy and help Americans put 
food on the table. The U.S. Senate 
should not look away in the face of so 
much need. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of my 
bill to make temporary modifications 
to the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program, which is at the desk. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read three times and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. ROBERTS. I rise to respond to 
this unanimous consent request to call 
up and pass a bill to make modifica-
tions to the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program, known as SNAP. 
Over the past few months, through 
the enactment of both the Families 
First Act and the CARES Act, Congress 
has provided both funding and flexibili-
ties for nutrition assistance during this 
pandemic emergency. The funding from 
the Families First and CARES Acts 
has included the following: $15 billion 
for the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-
ance Program; $8.8 billion for the 
School and Child Nutrition Programs; 
$1 billion in food distribution pro-
grams, like The Emergency Food As-
sistance Program, TEFAP, and the 
Food Distribution Program for Indian 
Reservations; $500 million for the Spe-
cial Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children, or 
the WIC Program. 
In addition, Congress provided emer-
gency SNAP benefits, allotments, and 
pandemic EBT benefits for children 
while schools are closed. 
The Department of Agriculture has 
been steadily distributing both food 
and benefits, and the Department has 
granted and extended many flexibili-
ties to State and sponsoring organiza-
tions to get food to those in need. 
The 
distinguished 
Senator 
from 
Michigan, for whom I have a great deal 
of respect and friendship—we have a 
history of working together on the Ag-
riculture Committee to help those in 
need. 
In fact, just last week, we wrote the 
Secretary 
of 
Agriculture, 
Sonny 
Perdue, about some of the WIC flexi-
bilities, and the Department of Agri-
culture has already acted to extend 
those flexibilities. This is just a recent 
example of the good work we can ac-
complish together, but I respectfully 
object to this unanimous consent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
agree with my friend from Kansas that 
we work together in many ways and 
have been able to get a lot of good 
things together by working across the 
aisle. I want to focus on just a couple 
of things to expound on what he said, 
though. 
While we, in fact, did add dollars for 
some emergency SNAP in the original 
Families First Response Act, unfortu-
nately, about 40 percent of the house-
holds didn’t get any extra help at all. 
These were our poorest citizens. These 
were those who were already getting— 
because their income was so low—the 
maximum benefit, and they got no help 
at all. So 40 percent of the folks didn’t 
see anything that was just described, 
and, for others, we are very concerned 
about the temporary nature of this and 
the fact that it was not enough to sus-
tain what is happening for families. 
The 15 percent that we are talking 
about, which is something that was 
done back during the economic reces-
sion and has been done in various ways 
in the past, is an important response to 
make sure that every single family and

individual who needs food assistance— 
not just some but that every single one 
can get the help they need at this time. 
What has been done up to this point 
was a start. It is surely not enough— 
surely not enough. At the very begin-
ning of this process, it was not clear 
how long this was going to go or how 
deep this was going to go. 
The U.S. Senate needs to respond to 
what we are seeing now and how fami-
lies are being affected across the coun-
try. 
I am going to now yield to Senator 
BROWN and then Senator KLOBUCHAR. I 
believe I saw her on the floor as well. 
Yes, Senator KLOBUCHAR and then Sen-
ator WYDEN as well—three tremendous 
advocates. 
Thank you so much. 
Senator BROWN. 
Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Senator 
STABENOW, and thank you for intro-
ducing this bill and your leadership on 
all issues agriculture, especially the 
importance of SNAP and feeding peo-
ple. 
This is the United States of America. 
One specific thing Senator STABENOW 
said that really caught me was, it is 
pretty simple: People should have a 
roof over their head, and people should 
have food on the table. 
Think if you don’t. I don’t think that 
probably most of us know, intimately, 
people who don’t have enough to eat 
and people who get evicted. I don’t 
think we feel the anxiety they feel 
every night, wondering about the next 
meal. Today is July 1, wondering about 
the rent payment. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR said this earlier 
today; that before the coronavirus, 25 
percent of Americans who rent spend 
more than half their income in rent. So 
if one thing goes wrong in their life— 
one thing goes wrong: their car breaks 
down; they have a problem and their 
roof leaks; their child gets sick; they 
get hurt on the job and miss 2 weeks of 
pay, their life turns upside down. 
Do we think about them? Do we 
think about their anxiety? Apparently 
not. 
Today, this could have been a really, 
really, really good day for workers in 
this country—for fast-food workers, for 
the people who change the linen in hos-
pitals, for custodians, for data entry 
people, for home care workers—people 
who are on their feet all day long 
working for little pay. It could have 
been a big-deal day. It could be a red- 
letter day for them because we could 
have assured them that they will not 
get evicted; that they will not get fore-
closed on if their hours have been cut 
back or if they are laid off; and we 
could have assured them that they 
would get a little food on the table. 
But under the leadership of Senator 
MCCONNELL, we don’t ever do that. 
Senator MCCONNELL’s office is back 
there. I don’t know if he ever thinks 
about people like that. One of my fa-
vorite Lincoln quotes is he said: I have 
to get out of the White House and get 
my public opinion baths. I have to see 
how people are living. I want to hear 
about people’s lives. 
I can’t imagine Senator MCCONNELL 
does any of that; otherwise, he couldn’t 
make these awful, hard-hearted deci-
sions to eliminate unemployment when 
it ends at the end of this month. Maybe 
he will decide to compromise, but, 
right now, if you are an unemployed 
worker, and you can’t find a job in De-
troit or in Portland or in Eugene or in 
St. Paul, you wonder if your unemploy-
ment is going to just stop, and you are 
going to get evicted. You don’t have 
enough food, and we don’t do a damn 
thing about it here. 
This is the United States of America. 
Couldn’t we help hard-working Ameri-
cans? Instead, we see an objection to 
rental assistance. We see an objection 
to increasing food benefits. I don’t get 
it, the United States of America, that 
this would possibly happen. 
We should take up and pass Senator 
STABENOW’s bill right now to increase 
SNAP benefits. 
At a time when the country is finally 
focusing on racial injustice, we have to 
recognize these issues are all con-
nected. 
You all know that this pandemic has 
been the great revealer. It has revealed 
income inequality. It has revealed ra-
cial disparities. It has revealed life 
expectancies. If you look like me, your 
life expectancy is a good bit longer 
than if you are African American or 
Latino in this country; that our earn-
ing power is more and that our edu-
cational opportunities are greater. We 
know all that. Are we doing anything 
about it here? No, we are not. 
The President of the United States 
has put all of that behind him. He 
doesn’t care about the pandemic. He 
never mentions the 120,000 people in 
this country—our brothers and sisters 
and mothers and fathers and children 
and grandparents who have died from 
this. He never mentions them. He has 
forgotten about that. He just doesn’t 
want it to affect the stock market. 
It goes on and on and on. Increased 
demand at food banks, we hear it all 
the time. We see the stress on employ-
ees and the volunteers at food banks. 
Governor DeWine, to his credit—a 
Republican, and I appreciate that he is 
doing this—sent the National Guard in 
to help at food banks. Why? Because 
many, many food bank volunteers are 
older, and they couldn’t risk getting 
exposed to so many who are coming in 
for food. The lines are hours and hours 
and hours long. Food insecurity rates 
have doubled since March, almost. 
We are realizing why we have a safe-
ty net in this country. We are realizing 
the importance of government. But, ap-
parently, my colleagues, under Senator 
MCCONNELL
and 
President 
Trump, 
don’t want to recognize that govern-
ment has a role in our lives. 
The House did its part. It passed the 
Heroes Act, which has a 15-percent 
across-the-board increase of SNAP ben-
efits, but, as always, Leader MCCON-
NELL is standing in the way. 
Leader MCCONNELL says no to rental 
assistance. He says no to helping State 
and local governments. Wait until the 
layoffs in Michigan and Ohio and Or-
egon and Minnesota and North and 
South Dakota. Wait until the govern-
ment and the local government layoffs 
come. Then what are we going to do? 
People shouldn’t have to always fend 
for themselves in the middle of a crisis. 
We should not have people starving or 
risking their health to get food. People 
shouldn’t be hungry in this country—in 
this rich country. 
It is time for us to step up. It is time 
to lead where the President has failed. 
It is time for Senator MCCONNELL to 
let us do our jobs—debate this; let’s 
pass it; and let’s move forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator BROWN for his 
eloquence and advocacy, and I want to 
thank him also for being an incredibly 
effective member of the Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, as 
is our next speaker, the senior Senator 
from Minnesota—two Members that I 
am so proud to have as partners of 
mine on the Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry Committee. 
I yield time to Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Michi-
gan for her leadership on the Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry Com-
mittee, helping to pass and leading the 
last farm bill in the Senate, along with 
Senator ROBERTS and so many of us 
who are on that committee. 
We understand that rural America is 
hurting right now, and rural America 
is actually part of the solution as well 
for so many people who are hungry and 
who need help. 
This pandemic and its economic im-
pact has left 41 million Americans un-
employed and strained the financial se-
curity of hundreds of thousands of fam-
ilies across this country. 
I have always worked to ensure, from 
the minute I got on the Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, 
that we focus on nutrition. Programs 
like the Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance Program—or, as it is known, 
SNAP—are the place to do this: to pro-
vide meaningful relief to families, chil-
dren, senior citizens, veterans. People 
all over this country, people who never 
thought they would be out of a job, 
people who used to—and I heard this 
story in Minnesota—volunteer in food 
banks, now they are standing in line at 
food banks because they unexpectedly 
lost their jobs. 
Many of us have seen this. I have vis-
ited these food banks. Even before the 
pandemic, more than 37 million people, 
including more than 11 million chil-
dren, were living in a food-insecure 
household.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4124 
July 1, 2020 
projected these numbers to increase 
this year to more than 54 million peo-
ple, including 18 million children. 
The 350 food shelves in my State op-
erated by Second Harvest Heartland 
are seeing double or triple the number 
of visitors. So this weekend, on Sun-
day, I visited one of our biggest food 
shelves, Second Harvest Heartland, 
with Director Allison O’Toole, with a 
number of people who were working 
there around the clock. They just re-
leased a study. What the study said is 
that before the pandemic 1 in 11 Min-
nesotans were living with hunger. Now, 
they project for August—only a little 
over a month from now—that one in 
eight Minnesotans will be food inse-
cure—one in eight. 
They said, tracking our State’s his-
tory back to the Great Depression, 
they have never seen anything like this 
since the Great Depression—not even 
the economic downturn 10 years ago, 
not the ups and downs in unemploy-
ment that we have seen in our rural 
areas, the farm crises up in Northern 
Minnesota—nothing like they are pro-
jecting to happen. 
July begins with the Fourth of July. 
The Fourth of July is when we cele-
brate our country. We celebrate what 
America means. My hope is that we 
will end July by actually passing the 
Heroes Act. I know we are going to ne-
gotiate it, colleagues. I know we will 
make changes over what passed in the 
House, but we cannot let our States go 
bankrupt. We must help local areas. 
I was on the phone today with our 
friends in the Fargo-Moorhead area, 
and we have seen it there too. We have 
seen it all over our State. 
The SNAP program was originally 
designed to respond to changes in the 
economy by expanding to meet in-
creased need during economic down-
turns and contracting as economic re-
covery alleviates the need for food as-
sistance. 
Under the farm bill that was signed 
into law under Senator STABENOW’s 
leadership in 2018, we preserved this 
critical lifeline. The conference report, 
which passed with 87 votes in the Sen-
ate and 369 votes in the House of Rep-
resentatives, avoided making cuts to 
benefits or changes to eligibility that 
would take away benefits or create ob-
stacles. 
At this difficult time, we should en-
sure that we are getting assistance to 
all of those who need it, not put up new 
barriers—not with what we are seeing 
with more COVID cases in the southern 
part of this country and in the western 
part of this country. 
In fact, the facts and the numbers 
bear out that we should be increasing 
those benefits. The House has taken ac-
tion to do just that by passing a 15-per-
cent increase in SNAP benefits during 
the pandemic. That is what they did in 
the Heroes Act. That is what we should 
do here. 
At the same time, the middle of a 
pandemic is the wrong time to be cut-
ting SNAP benefits or kicking partici-
pants out of the program, and that is 
why I have called on the administra-
tion to withdraw rules that would take 
these benefits away from families in 
need. 
As for food deserts, again, the pan-
demic has simply put a big, fat magni-
fying glass on a problem that already 
existed, and that is that 23.5 million 
Americans live in a food desert where 
the absence of a grocery store within 1 
mile of their home makes it more dif-
ficult to purchase fresh, nutritious 
food. 
Low-income Americans and people of 
color are much more likely to live in a 
food desert, and people in rural areas 
live in these food deserts all over 
America. 
That is why Senator BROWN and I 
wrote a letter with 20 Senators urging 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
to 
prioritize these programs intended to 
minimize food deserts and support 
local and regional efforts for these 
projects. 
We cannot overlook the capacity 
needs of food shelves, and that is some-
thing I talked about with our friends at 
Second Harvest Heartland just this 
weekend. 
The WORK NOW Act is something 
that—I appreciate Senator WYDEN is 
here as one of the cosponsors, along 
with 
Senator 
BROWN
and 
Senator 
SCHATZ—supports nonprofit organiza-
tions, to make it easier for them to 
hire people who are actually out of 
work, who could then help other peo-
ple. 
It is why I joined Senator STABENOW 
and several of my colleagues in the Ag-
riculture Committee in introducing the 
Food Supply Protection Act to help 
food banks increase their capacity and 
strengthen 
partnerships 
to 
prevent 
food waste while feeding more families. 
One of my predecessors, Vice Presi-
dent Hubert H. Humphrey, whose desk 
I stand in front of today—his name is 
carved in the desk—served on the Agri-
culture Committee. He grew up in a 
small town in South Dakota. He be-
came a professor eventually, but his fa-
ther was a pharmacist. He understood 
the importance—growing up in that 
family, seeing the ups and downs of 
rural America—of stable government 
policy for both agriculture producers 
and families struggling to put food on 
the table. 
He was a leading advocate of Federal 
nutrition programs and played an in-
strumental role in the passage of what 
was then called the Food Stamp Act of 
1964, which turned what was then just a 
pilot program into the permanent pro-
gram we know today. 
He knew that the moral test of gov-
ernment is how government treats its 
most vulnerable citizens: those in need, 
those who are seniors, those with dis-
abilities. 
He once said this: ‘‘We will be re-
membered not for the power of our 
weapons but for the power of our com-
passion, our dedication to human wel-
fare.’’ 
In these times of uncertainty and 
with rising food insecurity, we need to 
work to ensure that the nutrition 
needs of our most vulnerable citizens 
are met. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my friend from Min-
nesota for her wonderful words. Again, 
we think about all the need that is 
there, and we are here just trying to 
make sure that people can get their ba-
sics, such as food on the table for the 
kids. 
We are very fortunate, and I feel very 
fortunate to have both Senators from 
Oregon here on the floor this evening. 
I am going to first yield now to Sen-
ator WYDEN, but I want to say first: 
Senator WYDEN is the ranking member 
of the Finance Committee, as we know. 
I think that is a pretty powerful com-
mittee, and we are grateful for his 
leadership. 
I am particularly grateful for the 
work the Senator is doing and has done 
on unemployment compensation and 
what needs to be done and the impor-
tance of tying all of this together—for 
somebody having enough income to be 
able to pay the rent and then getting 
enough help to put food on the table. 
I am proud to be his partner and very 
much appreciate all that he is doing to 
put people first—Senator WYDEN. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator STABENOW, my seatmate on 
the Senate Finance Committee. We are 
a bit more socially distant now, but we 
still have spent this time plotting and 
thinking and trying to imagine a fu-
ture that provides the kinds of prior-
ities that we have been talking about 
today. 
Senator STABENOW’s reports particu-
larly—these wonderful reports that 
document the cost of inaction—I have 
almost made them a reference tool on 
my desk so, when I have to look at a 
particular area, I can turn to one of 
those Stabenow reports. They are al-
ways understandable, always cutting 
right to the heart of the issue, which is 
this: How are you going to give the op-
portunity for everybody in America to 
get ahead—not just the people at the 
top but everybody in America the 
chance to get ahead? 
I am not going to take but a few min-
utes. I do want to note that I believe 
that Oregon is the only State to have 
produced 100 percent of its U.S. Sen-
ators on behalf of the cause tonight. 
This is something Senator MERKLEY 
and I enjoy doing when there is an op-
portunity to speak for justice. 
I want to reflect for a minute on how 
the day started, because I guess it was 
almost 12 hours ago our Democratic 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, stood right 
there; I stood where I am; and he out-
lined the Schumer-Wyden proposal for 
the next steps on dealing with this 
crushing unemployment we have in our 
country—30 million people. 
The number is almost so large that 
the experts can’t get their arms around 
exactly how many people are unem-
ployed, but what we know is that every

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4125 
July 1, 2020 
week it goes up far more than that 
kind of similar period during the great 
recession. 
We talked about what is going to 
happen July 31. July 31, if the Senate 
does not act, we are going to have a 
tsunami of evictions. We are going to 
have families, just as Senator STABE-
NOW said, basically sitting in their liv-
ing rooms, sitting in their kitchens, 
and trying to figure out how they are 
going to make ends meet that month. 
Without 
supercharged 
unemploy-
ment, without the SNAP benefits that 
Senator STABENOW
is talking about, 
without the help Senator BROWN
is 
talking about with respect to housing 
and evictions, there are a lot of people 
who are just going to fall between the 
cracks. 
I thought, it being 12 hours since we 
began this, that I might just connect 
the dots for a few minutes. 
In the face of this historic public 
health emergency, we know that mil-
lions of Americans have their health on 
the line, and because Donald Trump 
has failed to get the COVID–19 virus 
under control, we have now got jobs on 
the line. Now many people are being 
forced to choose between feeding their 
child or paying the rent to keep a roof 
over their head. 
So you have housing, you have 
healthcare, you have unemployment, 
and we are trying very hard to be cre-
ative. I know, for my colleague from 
Michigan, hardly a day goes by when 
she doesn’t talk to me about the ben-
efit of Work Share, a creative way to 
make unemployment dollars stretch. 
By the way, Senator MERKLEY talks 
about it almost as much as my friend 
from Michigan because he feels very 
strongly about it. 
So as we connect the dots, as we have 
over the last 12 hours, and we talk 
about housing and healthcare and un-
employment, I also want people to un-
derstand that those challenges were se-
rious last week and the week before. 
We ought to put in context what we 
heard yesterday from Tony Fauci, who 
said that the trajectory as of right now 
is one where our country may possibly 
see 100,000 new cases a day. 
So let’s picture what that means for 
the SNAP program and how hard Sen-
ator STABENOW’s work is going to be, 
because we have heard Chairman ROB-
ERTS—and you all have worked very 
well—and the like, and hopefully we 
can get that worked out because I 
don’t even want to begin to imagine 
how much hunger and unemployment 
and housing challenges we are going to 
face with 100,000 new cases a day. 
So the work that Senator STABENOW 
is doing is urgent business. It really 
also brings us back to this: How can it 
be, in a country as strong and as good 
as ours, that we have all these kids 
going to bed hungry at night? 
In our home State—the State Sen-
ator MERKLEY and I have the privilege 
to represent—one out of every four Or-
egonians worries about putting food on 
the table. Our Oregon Food Bank, run 
by the inimitable Susannah Morgan, is 
doing a fabulous job. But the fact is— 
and I was really struck by this—the Or-
egon Food Bank has told my office that 
demand for emergency food has dou-
bled in Oregon over the past 2 months 
at Oregon Food Bank’s five branches. 
Recently, I was home. Whenever Sen-
ator MERKLEY and I are home, we try 
to get out and talk to a variety of com-
munity groups. I was helping distribute 
food baskets. I was struck because we 
were all being socially distant. They 
were handing me the bags, and I was 
putting them in the back of the cart. I 
got a chance to have a little bit of a 
conversation with those people. The 
cars were backed up for blocks and 
blocks on the east side of our commu-
nity, where Senator MERKLEY and I 
both live. 
There were people who had not faced 
this kind of challenge before. You 
looked at them, and they looked at 
you, and you could see in their faces 
that they never expected this, particu-
larly the seniors. 
My colleague has heard all the Gray 
Panthers stories. Senator MERKLEY 
heard them 50 times; you only heard 
them 25 times. But a lot of those sen-
iors going through in their cars, it was 
clear, also, that was the big outing for 
the day. They didn’t get really dressed 
up, but kind of, and the car was per-
fectly clean. They came through, and 
they wanted to visit. But you knew 
that, without that food, they wouldn’t 
have a chance to make it through the 
day. 
What this comes down to is what 
Senator STABENOW is basically doing, is 
being in the Tikkun Olam business. 
That is a phrase Jews often use; it is 
about perfecting the world. It is about 
the moral obligation we have in Amer-
ica to do everything within our power 
to make sure that kids and families do 
not go hungry. Susannah Morgan was 
real clear about the things she wanted 
Senator MERKLEY and I to talk about 
on the floor of the Senate and make 
sure they got out. She wants to make 
sure that people can get assistance 
through a regular EBT card. 
The Trump administration, of course, 
has pushed to impose strenuous work 
requirements, which don’t make any 
sense—particularly in a public health 
crisis—in workplaces and can be dan-
gerous. We want to expand ways to get 
food to SNAP participants, like home 
delivery, curbside pickup. We want to 
extend what has come to be known as 
the pandemic EBT through the summer 
and any future school closures. 
This is so important because, even 
before the pandemic, I often would go 
to various kinds of programs run by 
community groups, and they would be 
serving a lunch. I would shoot baskets 
with kids for a bit. I would see the kids 
drift away, and they would take at 
least two lunches—at least two. I 
would go and visit. It was clear that 
they were just ravenous; they were in-
credibly hungry. This was pre-COVID. I 
would ask: What did you have to eat 
since you were here yesterday to shoot 
baskets with a Senator? 
They would look at you and say: 
Well, I had a Milky Way. 
That is what we are dealing with in 
America right now. What Senator STA-
BENOW is doing with these programs is 
so incredibly important. When we have 
our priorities straight, kids who are el-
igible for free or reduced-cost meals 
would be able to get that food. I know 
that my colleague from Michigan has 
worked hard to make sure that those 
meals include more fresh fruits and 
vegetables. I heard her talk about it. 
She is trying to reach out to so many 
communities where often—and Senator 
KLOBUCHAR talked about it—it is kind 
of a food desert. If you don’t have the 
program Senator KLOBUCHAR is work-
ing for, you are just going to have a lot 
of people like those kids I met going 
hungry. 
I am going to close with one last 
thought that is important to us in our 
part of the country. The reality is that, 
for many years, none of this was at all 
partisan. We have all heard about Bob 
Dole and George McGovern and the his-
tory books, and they made their com-
mon cause with respect to agriculture, 
and they would round up urban legisla-
tors. We read about that, various his-
torical figures from the East, they 
weren’t partisan. 
In our part of the world, when we 
talk about the practical, commonsense 
ideas that Senator STABENOW is offer-
ing for feeding hungry people, we just 
call them the Oregon Way. People al-
ways ask: Well, where is this Oregon 
Way, Ron? Where is this thing? Is it on 
the top of the capitol dome or Pioneer 
Square in Portland? I say: No, it is 
what we have tried to do for years. 
I want to thank Senator STABENOW 
for bringing heart and a pragmatic ap-
proach to this. We saw how you just 
reached out to Senator ROBERTS. By 
the way, I am on the Intelligence Com-
mittee. I am not going to give out any-
thing classified, but Senator ROBERTS 
walked by, and he said: We are going to 
get this worked out. We are going to 
figure this out. 
I am going to end on a little bit of an 
upbeat note because that happened 
maybe only half an hour ago, and hav-
ing watched my seatmate in action 
with Chairman ROBERTS often pull to-
gether 
agreements 
where 
nobody 
thought an agreement was possible—no 
pressure, don’t feel like we are singling 
you out, but just know that a lot of us 
are going to be your allies in this fight 
because it is a fight for fairness, it is a 
fight for kids, it is a fight for families 
that are hurting, and it is a fight for an 
America 
where 
everybody 
gets 
a 
chance to get ahead. 
Thank you for doing that. 
Ms. STABENOW. I am going to yield 
to Senator MERKLEY in a second. First, 
I want to say to the senior Senator 
from Oregon, when you talk about the 
Oregon Way, this needs to be the Amer-
ican way. This is the American way. 
Right now, the average food benefit 
under SNAP is $4.17 a day for a person.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4126 
July 1, 2020 
Think about going to the grocery 
store—$4.17 a day. We are asking for a 
15-percent increase during this pan-
demic. We ought to all be looking at 
these numbers and going: Come on, the 
America way ought to be to make sure 
somebody can put food on the table for 
the children and that they are not eat-
ing a Milky Way until they can get to 
school. 
I am going to now turn to Senator 
MERKLEY. I want to give a shout-out to 
Senator MERKLEY, who is the ranking 
Democrat on the Agriculture Sub-
committee 
of 
Appropriations, 
ex-
tremely important. He is such a won-
derful partner and advocate on all of 
the food access issues and healthy food 
issues and so on. We are so lucky to 
have Senator MERKLEY in the position 
that he is in. I will turn to Senator 
MERKLEY. 
I yield time to Senator MERKLEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to engage in col-
loquy with my colleague from Michi-
gan. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Senator STABENOW, 
it is a pleasure to be here with you in 
this fight for something as funda-
mental as hunger. As I was listening to 
the conversation, your words and our 
colleague’s from Ohio, SHERROD BROWN, 
who was speaking, and our colleague 
from Minnesota and partner from Or-
egon, I thought: How many Senators 
have 
experienced 
hunger 
this 
last 
week, the inability to have a meal? 
What is your sense of that? 
Ms. STABENOW. My guess would be 
that everyone is like me, and, no, I 
have not experienced a sense of it. 
Mr. MERKLEY. No one in this Cham-
ber is missing a meal. 
Ms. STABENOW. We are all ex-
tremely fortunate; we don’t have to ex-
perience that. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I am pretty sure, 
down the hall in the House of Rep-
resentatives, nobody is missing a meal; 
yet so many people in each of our 
States are missing meals. In my State 
of Oregon, hunger has doubled since 
March. I imagine hunger has increased 
in your home State of Michigan. 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Absolutely—at 
least doubled, absolutely. 
Mr. MERKLEY. It is being driven by 
massive unemployment. The estimate 
in April was for families who earn less 
than $40,000 a year, 40 percent had lost 
their job. I think that was April. Now, 
maybe it is well over 50 percent. Half of 
working America of modest incomes 
lost their jobs, and it wasn’t that easy 
to sign up for unemployment benefits. 
We still have a couple hundred thou-
sand people in Oregon who are waiting 
for unemployment benefits. I can guar-
antee you they are very hungry. I know 
there are those in Michigan as well. 
The majority leader has decided to 
send the Senate on vacation for 2 
weeks. I guess my question to you is: 
Does hunger take a vacation? Do those 
who are hungry in Oregon and hungry 
in Pennsylvania, is it going to take a 
vacation for 2 weeks? 
Ms. STABENOW. I don’t think hun-
ger ever takes a vacation, if it is in the 
middle of the night, early in the morn-
ing, all the way through the week. I 
mean, the reality is, when we are here, 
there are people around this country 
who are hungry. When Senator MCCON-
NELL adjourns the Senate for the week 
and we are not here for the next 2 
weeks, people are going to continue to 
be hungry and probably getting more 
and more hungry as the economic situ-
ation gets worse. 
Mr. MERKLEY. We might think of 
hunger as kind of a temporary discom-
fort, something you get through, but 
my understanding is, when children are 
hungry, when they don’t have the basic 
nutrients on a regular basis, it dam-
ages the development of the mind. 
Is that something you heard? 
Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. 
Mr. MERKLEY. We are talking about 
millions of American children who are 
suffering not just discomfort but dam-
age to their minds because they don’t 
have enough to eat. The majority lead-
er is sending us on vacation rather 
than addressing it. 
Thank you to my colleague for com-
ing to the floor, organizing, carrying 
this forward, the work you do, and au-
thorizing the work the Appropriations 
Committee does and the funding. 
We have got to address this. We have 
to recognize how bad the situation is, 
how bad things are nationally. More 
than 40 million people have lost their 
jobs; 120,000 people have died. The rate 
of infections are exploding across the 
country—and how bad things are in my 
home State—243,000 people are out of 
work. We have an unemployment rate 
of over 14 percent, higher than it was 
any point in the great recession. Food 
insecurity and hunger have doubled 
since March. Food is at the top of the 
hierarchy of needs for human life. 
All we have done is come to the floor 
and say: Let’s help in a pretty modest 
way with a 15-percent increase—the $4 
and change that the Senator talked 
about—60 cents? We probably should be 
doubling it. 
But that 15-percent increase in the 
maximum benefits does make a dif-
ference. It makes a difference. Hunger 
doesn’t take a vacation and neither 
should we. 
As Senator STABENOW proposed, we 
should debate a bill now—pass now a 
bill. We should effect these changes at 
this moment and not leave this Cham-
ber until we have gotten the work of 
the American people done for the most 
important need any human being has, 
and that is basic nutrition. 
When Martin Luther King was ac-
cepting his Nobel Peace Prize, he said 
that he had ‘‘the audacity to believe 
that people everywhere could have 
three meals a day for their bodies, edu-
cation and culture for their minds, and 
dignity, equality and freedom for their 
spirits.’’ Let this Chamber have the au-
dacity not just to believe that people 
can have three meals a day but to 
make it happen. 
I am fully in support of your efforts, 
a full partner on behalf of all those who 
suffer hunger in the United States, on 
behalf of every child who wants a basic 
foundation to thrive here in the United 
States of America. We are failing in 
our job. Hunger doesn’t take a vacation 
and neither should the Senate. Let’s 
get the act passed now. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
GARDNER). The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my friend from Oregon 
for his comments and his ongoing lead-
ership on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. It is incredibly important. 
Now, I am going to turn to the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania, Mr. CASEY, 
and thank him on so many different 
issues, which range from children and 
what they need, in terms of healthcare 
and being able to have the support they 
need to be able to grow and be success-
ful, all the way up to our older citizens 
and those in nursing homes, where he 
is providing such advocacy now as we 
look at what needs to be done to sup-
port our seniors and those in nursing 
homes. 
Thank you for always putting people 
first and for joining us tonight. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to 
thank the senior Senator from Michi-
gan for her leadership. I will say more 
about her work in a moment. 
We would not be here tonight talking 
about this program that we know by 
the acronym, but the words are all im-
portant, Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance 
Program—SNAP—what 
we 
used to call food stamps. We wouldn’t 
be here without her leadership and 
those who made food insecurity and 
anti-hunger initiatives a priority. 
This is a program that I believe is 
core to our responsibility to support 
American families during this national 
crisis—the public health crisis and the 
jobs crisis. This program, the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program, 
is a lifeline for millions of Americans 
to access the food they need to survive. 
I think that is an understatement. As 
the junior Senator from Oregon, Mr. 
MERKLEY, just said, this is about life 
itself. This is about being able to live 
and being able to survive. No human 
being can survive without food, and so 
many go without food on a regular 
basis. So many others are food inse-
cure, but that doesn’t mean they have 
not felt the pain we are talking about. 
I wanted to say just a couple of words 
about Senator STABENOW because this 
has been not just an issue for her, not 
just a program, the SNAP program, 
and not just a cause of food insecurity, 
but it has really been a passion for her. 
Some people are mission-driven in 
their work. She has been one of those 
Senators who has been mission-driven 
to make sure we are doing everything

we can with every opportunity, every 
budget, every season of the Senate; 
that we do everything we can to help 
the most vulnerable. 
Someday, many years from now when 
many of us may not be around, there 
may be folks who are chronicling or 
summarizing the history of the Senate 
on particular issues. I am sure, just as 
we make reference to work that has 
preceded us or Senators who have pre-
ceded us—I have no doubt when a Sen-
ator stands up on this floor years from 
now, maybe even decades from now, 
and they talk about the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program, if they 
start to itemize or catalog or list the 
Senators who had the most profound 
impact on this program, Senator STA-
BENOW will be one of very few who will 
be listed in such a chronicle of the ad-
vocacy done for the SNAP program. 
William Jennings Bryan said a long 
time ago, in a different context, but he 
said it well about a cause, about how 
one person can make such a difference 
on one issue or one cause. We have seen 
some of that lately with Americans de-
manding action on a range of issues— 
marching and protesting for criminal 
justice reform or changes to policing or 
advocates for healthcare or whatever 
issue, whatever cause. William Jen-
nings Bryan said it well. I think he 
said it in 1896: ‘‘The humblest citizen in 
all the land, when clad . . . in a right-
eous cause, is stronger than all the 
hosts of error.’’ 
‘‘When clad . . . in a righteous cause, 
is stronger than all the hosts of error.’’ 
I think what he meant by that is that 
one citizen can have a huge impact. 
What we have even with Senator STA-
BENOW’s work is one Senator who can 
have an impact. This has been for her, 
I know, her righteous cause, and the 
country is better for her service and 
better for her work on this issue. 
What are we talking about here? 
When we say food insecurity, that may 
not sound too threatening to a lot of 
people. That means you are hungry. 
The person we are talking about might 
be an adult, but all too many times it 
is a child. When a child is hungry, it is 
hard as an adult to really fully under-
stand what that means. I never lived a 
day of my life when I was hungry the 
whole day or the second day or the 
third day, so I really can’t explain it. I 
never experienced it. I think that is 
probably true of most Members of Con-
gress. Maybe growing up for some, they 
were, but many, of course, now don’t 
feel that sense of food insecurity. 
It is a devastating reality for tens of 
millions of Americans. That was the 
case before the jobs crisis, before the 
COVID–19 public health crisis. It is 
ever more so now in the aftermath of 
the onset of the virus and while we are 
still in the grip of this COVID–19 dis-
ease—what we know and are describing 
worldwide as a pandemic. 
The pandemic has only made this cri-
sis worse. Even more urgent is the cri-
sis of food insecurity and economic in-
security. The unemployment numbers 
that we see now are further exacer-
bating what were already the undeni-
able realities of hunger, poverty, and 
food insecurity in this country. 
I know, for example, in my home 
State of Pennsylvania—I haven’t seen 
the May numbers yet, but April num-
bers were high: 15 percent unemploy-
ment, 975,000 people out of work, head-
ing toward a million people out of work 
in one State. I am certain that number 
will be lower in May, and thank God 
for that, and I hope lower in June 
again. 
When you are saying in one State 
there are hundreds of thousands more 
on top of the unemployed numbers 
from March, you can understand the 
terrible impact. When we talk about 
unemployment, that often leads to food 
insecurity, and that may lead to the 
kind of desperation that hunger can 
bring. You are talking about real pain 
in the lives of people—physical pain in 
an adult but especially in a child who 
may not be able to articulate the pain 
they are feeling. They may not be able 
to function, literally. They may not be 
able to function in any way. They cer-
tainly can’t learn in school. No human 
being can learn and grow if they are 
hungry all the time—no one, not the 
strongest person we know. 
I come from a heritage of people who 
left Ireland because of hunger. They 
called it the Great Hunger at the time. 
When policies were put in place or ac-
tions were not taken and hundreds of 
thousands of people starved, millions 
left Ireland, just like people leave their 
homelands today to escape hunger, to 
escape 
poverty, 
and 
even 
famine 
itself—the most extreme version of 
hunger around the world. 
We are talking about real physical 
pain. We are not just talking about a 
casual missing of a meal or being a lit-
tle bit hungry, as so many of us have 
never experienced. It is pain, but it is 
also fear. Imagine the fear of a parent. 
I can’t even begin to imagine as a par-
ent knowing that, for a lot of different 
reasons—job loss or other adverse cir-
cumstances in your life—you cannot 
afford to feed your children. That one 
person might have both the pain of 
hunger and the total fear of not being 
able to feed your children. If we are not 
doing something about that in the Sen-
ate, we are just not doing our job. 
We say: Oh, the CARES Act did this 
and the CARES Act did that. Well, do 
you know what? We have been trying 
for months now, on the Democratic 
side of the aisle in the Senate, to get a 
couple of things done. 
What are they? No. 1, increase in 
SNAP benefits by 15 percent. Why can’t 
that be done in the Senate when we 
know the pain and the reality of hun-
ger? Increase the minimum benefit 
level. Why can’t we do that in the Sen-
ate? We passed, what, five bills for $3 
trillion, and we can’t add more money 
to the SNAP program? I know, we did 
it in an earlier bill. Let’s stop patting 
ourselves on the back for that. 
Let’s do something transformative or 
at least do something substantial. 
Let’s not even get to transformative. 
Let’s get to substantial help for Ameri-
cans who are hungry right now, folks 
who are low income and are hungry; 
folks who had a job and lost their job 
are hungry. They may benefit from a 
food pantry or a food bank. We are not 
doing enough for them either. We are 
certainly not doing enough for the Sup-
plemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram, the most vulnerable among us. 
Thirdly, in addition, increase the 
benefits overall by 15—the minimum 
benefit level. We should put a stop to 
the rules the administration has been 
cramming down the throats of Ameri-
cans so that less people will get the 
benefit of the SNAP program. The ad-
ministration is dead wrong about that. 
They haven’t just doubled down on 
pushing these draconian changes to the 
program, but they recently appealed a 
court ruling that put a temporary 
pause on one of the rules. I don’t know 
the words for that—heartless, callous— 
but it is not good for any of us. It is a 
stain on the moral fabric of America 
when any administration does that. 
I know Senator STABENOW and her 
colleagues on the Agriculture, Nutri-
tion, 
and 
Forestry 
Committee—we 
should use the middle word more often 
than we do. It is not simply the Ag 
Committee. It is the Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry Committee. The 
nutrition part of it has been the sub-
ject of some good working relation-
ships on the committee. 
I want to thank Senator STABENOW 
for her work again. I appreciate the 
work she has done with Senator ROB-
ERTS. We have to do more than we have 
done on this program. 
I was proud a couple of years ago to 
finally—after attempt after attempt, 
year after year—finally, to get the 
Global Food Security Act passed. Peo-
ple have been waiting for that from the 
time Dick Lugar served in the Senate 
all the way through the time I teamed 
up with former Senator JOHNNY ISAK-
SON. 
We got the Global Food Security Act 
done, which meant that the Feed the 
Future Program—that great program 
the Bush administration started and 
the Obama administration brought to 
fruition—was codified in law. That was 
a good day for world food security. 
That was a good day for the world 
when America showed that we know 
how to do this, that we know how to 
help countries grow their own food and 
provide food security. Yet we haven’t 
done enough here. We never can say we 
have done enough here if we are not 
funding at an adequate level in the 
middle of a pandemic, in the middle of 
a public health emergency, and in a 
jobs and economic emergency. We can’t 
say we are doing enough if we are not 
going to invest in SNAP. 
I have a lot more to say, but I know 
I am over my time. Let me make one 
final point. 
The moral case is unassailable here. 
There is no disputing the benefit of 
this program, especially now. So I

think the moral question is settled. I 
just hope folks will consider it. 
How about the economic case? 
Say that you are a Member of Con-
gress and that you don’t like this pro-
gram. There are not many people who 
would admit to that, but you don’t like 
it, and you don’t want to add more 
funding to it. That is your position. 
That is a morally objectionable posi-
tion, but let’s say that is your position. 
You could also be for an increase to the 
SNAP program because it is a good 
bang for the buck, OK? 
So if all you are interested in is 
going back home and saying ‘‘Do you 
know what I did today? I voted for a 
program that will more than pay for 
itself, and it will help everybody’’—if 
that is what your game is and if that is 
what makes you happy, your going 
back to your community, to your 
State, then fine. This program, the 
SNAP program, is a great bang for the 
buck. 
If you spend a buck on SNAP benefits 
in an economic downturn—and I will 
make sure I cite the source here. It is 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 
Economic 
Research 
Service. 
Guess 
what. You will get $1.50 in return, 
maybe even as high as $1.80. Let’s go 
with the current number of $1.50. That 
is a pretty good ROI, return on invest-
ment. 
If that is all you care about, is a re-
turn on investment, and you don’t care 
about the program—you are not really 
troubled by food insecurity, and you 
are not really persuaded by the pain of 
hunger—then support it because it is a 
good bang for the buck. That would 
make sense. That is the American way 
to consider what we should be doing 
here. Consider the moral case, which 
should be enough, but you can also 
consider the efficacy of the program— 
the effect, the value—in an economic 
sense. 
We are all better off when SNAP is 
funded at an adequate level—all of us— 
because of that bang for the buck and 
because when people get SNAP dollars, 
they spend them. Guess what. That is 
good for all of us. It is good for our 
local economies, and it is good for our 
State economies. It is good for pro-
ducers, for the people transporting the 
food, and for the people marketing the 
food. That is why farmers and people in 
the ag sector of our economy are some-
times the biggest proponents of the 
SNAP program. 
This is the right thing to do to try to 
ease some of that pain—that awful 
pain—that children feel in the middle 
of the night, in the morning when they 
wake up, at lunchtime when other kids 
are eating something and they may not 
be eating, especially now that they are 
away from school, at night, and when 
they go to bed at night. 
So let’s come together and get some-
thing done. There is some good news in 
that we might be considering another 
bill, but let’s meet our obligation on 
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program. If others who have been re-
luctant to do that vote for this and 
support this, then you can do all the 
pats on the back that you want, but 
let’s do the right thing for America, es-
pecially for those suffering from the 
pain of hunger. 
I yield the floor to the senior Senator 
from Michigan. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, 
I thank my friend from Pennsylvania 
for his passion and for his being such a 
wonderful partner on these issues. I 
very much appreciate his speaking 
about the fact that there is an eco-
nomic benefit. 
If nothing else, if someone wants to 
look at how we can help our farmers, 
how we can help our grocery stores, 
how we can help those in the food 
chain—all of whom we want to help as 
well—you do that in the most efficient 
way possible, which is by giving people 
the funds to go buy food directly in the 
grocery stores so that they are able, 
when they have a need like this, to 
support their families. 
The great thing about SNAP is that 
it is set up so that when the economy 
gets better, the food assistance goes 
down. When the economy gets worse, 
the food assistance goes up. The chal-
lenge for us right now is that there is 
such a crisis and there are so many 
more people needing help—people who 
never in their lives thought they would 
need help—that we are in a situation in 
which we are called upon to meet that 
need and to be able to increase what we 
are doing. 
There was a small effort at the begin-
ning to provide some additional help, 
but it nowhere near met the need we 
have now—nowhere near. When I think 
about negotiating the CARES Act and 
the fact that, again, the average ben-
efit for food assistance in this country 
per person is $4.17 a day, the White 
House said no to any increase to the 
$4.17 a day. Leader MCCONNELL said no 
to any increase in the CARES Act—to 
the $4.17 a day for people. 
There is something wrong with that, 
so we are here on the floor to say we 
have to do better. The Senate has to do 
better. The House did better when it 
passed the Heroes Act. It gave some ad-
ditional support and help. The Senate 
needs to do the same. The Senate could 
have done the same tonight rather 
than to now wait 2 weeks, as we will 
not be in session. We haven’t really 
started negotiating what comes next, 
and it will take weeks after that. 
Every single day, there are people 
going hungry. The pain that Senator 
CASEY talked about is something being 
experienced by people tonight and 
being experienced by people in the 
morning and every single day going 
forward. That is the reality for too 
many families in America—in the 
United 
States 
of 
America—and 
it 
doesn’t have to be that way. 
We can at least give some help. I 
wish we could do more. We couldn’t get 
a 15-percent increase in the CARES 
Act. I would love to be able to do more 
than that, but at a minimum, we 
should be doing that. That is what the 
House did. That is what has been done 
in other economic downturns, and that 
is what we should be doing to help fam-
ilies in America who, frankly, just 
want to know somebody has their 
backs right now when everything is 
coming at them and when they are try-
ing to figure out how they are going to 
keep their heads above water and care 
for their children and make sure that 
the older adults in their lives have the 
help and support they need as well. 
We are going to keep working on this 
until we get it. There is just no excuse 
not to be able to meet the need that so 
many millions of families are feeling 
right now. 
This is a moral moment for the Sen-
ate. It could have been a moral 
Wednesday. If there had not been an 
objection, we could have gotten it done 
tonight. Wouldn’t that have been a 
great way to go into the Fourth of July 
weekend—being able to provide some 
small, additional food assistance for 
millions of Americans who are in need 
right now? This is not going to happen 
now because of the objection, but we 
are going to keep going until we can 
get families the help they need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, before we 
close tonight, I want to talk about a 
story that is troubling a lot of Ameri-
cans—one that we have just learned 
about in the last couple of days—and 
that is the recent events regarding the 
U.S. presence in Afghanistan and some 
of the reporting. 
Like many of my colleagues—and I 
am sure this is a feeling shared by tens 
and tens of millions of Americans—I 
am alarmed, as I know they are, by re-
ports of the intelligence community’s 
discovery that the Russian Govern-
ment offered to pay Taliban and 
Haqqani Network militants to target 
American troops in Afghanistan. 
The New York Times broke the story 
on June 26. Since then, several ques-
tions have emerged regarding how the 
intelligence has been handled, how long 
decisionmakers within the U.S. Gov-
ernment have known about this, and 
thirdly, what measures the administra-
tion is taking to hold Russia account-
able. 
Obviously, there are a number of sto-
ries by other news outlets in addition 
to that by the New York Times. I will 
just refer to one excerpt from the New 
York Times’ June 26 report. 
It reads: ‘‘An operation to incentivize 
the killing of American and other 
NATO troops would be a significant 
and provocative escalation of what 
American and Afghan officials have

said 
is 
Russian 
support 
for 
the 
Taliban.’’ 
The story later goes on to read: ‘‘Any 
involvement with the Taliban that re-
sulted in the deaths of American troops 
would also be a huge escalation of Rus-
sia’s so-called hybrid war against the 
United States, a strategy of desta-
bilizing adversaries through a combina-
tion of such tactics as cyberattacks 
. . . and covert and deniable military 
operations.’’ 
We have learned in recent days that 
these reports have been circulating 
through the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity since early 2019, but there was lit-
tle to no action taken. The timeline re-
garding these events is of particular 
concern to me and, I know, to many 
Americans but especially to those who 
represent a State in which there is a 
direct connection. 
In April of 2019, three U.S. marines 
were killed in a car bomb near Bagram 
Airfield in Afghanistan. There was 
speculation that this may have been a 
bounty attack that had been carried 
out by the Taliban for the Russians. 
There has been further reporting on 
this—tracking the dollars—by the New 
York Times and maybe by a few other 
outlets, but I know the New York 
Times did. 
One of the marines killed in that 
April 2019 attack was a Pennsylvanian. 
If there had been credible intelligence 
regarding the Russian plot and if that 
intelligence had been acted upon, one 
question I have is—and it is only a 
question; I don’t know the answer to 
this question, but I ask it—could the 
death of this young Pennsylvania ma-
rine and his brothers in arms have been 
averted? 
That is a question. I don’t know the 
answer to it. I hope, in the coming days 
and weeks—and I hope not longer than 
weeks—we will have an answer to that 
question, among many, as it troubles 
so many Americans. 
As of the close of last year, December 
of 2019, 294 servicemembers from Penn-
sylvania had been killed in the wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan—the third high-
est toll of any State. Our State has 
sacrificed a lot. If Russia had had any 
hand in contributing to these losses, to 
say that it is offensive, enraging, and 
deeply problematic is an understate-
ment and warrants a close look not 
only at the U.S. engagement in Af-
ghanistan but also at how we respond— 
how the United States of America re-
sponds—to Vladimir Putin’s efforts to 
disrupt U.S. efforts overseas and take 
American lives while doing it. 
Accordingly, I have several questions 
about how the intelligence has been 
handled and what measures have been 
taken to hold Russia accountable for 
these horrific, incendiary, unlawful ac-
tions contrary to international law. 
The administration must brief all 
Members of Congress immediately. I 
think Americans are offended when the 
administration briefs one side of the 
aisle. All Members of Congress should 
be briefed. Those briefings should occur 
immediately and in close proximity to 
the reporting. The briefings should in-
clude when they received the intel-
ligence—when the administration re-
ceived it—when the President was 
briefed, and what actions were consid-
ered in response. I also call on the ad-
ministration to report to Congress on a 
process for protecting our troops in 
moving forward. 
You could be justifiably offended by 
inaction by the administration or for 
the knowledge that preceded that inac-
tion, that they did nothing in response 
to it. 
It is especially offensive now to a lot 
of Americans that this information 
now is in the public record and there 
seems to be no evidence of any kind of 
a response, any kind of an action. 
So I think the administration should 
report to Congress not just on who 
knew what when, but also on what we 
do going forward. 
The families of these fallen soldiers 
deserve answers. The American people, 
obviously, deserve answers as well. 
We cannot let Russia and Vladimir 
Putin get away with this. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want

think we have created a package that 
is acceptable to everyone and we will

hopefully, we will be able to lock in our

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to clarify a point concerning my 
amendment No. 2270 to the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2021, S. 4049. This amendment 
would establish in law the position of 
the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs 
at the State Department and provides 
that the Special Envoy shall have the 
rank and status of ambassador. Under 
article II of the Constitution, the 
President’s power to appoint ambas-
sadors is subject to the advice and con-
sent of the Senate. Accordingly, it is 
my view that the appointment of the 
Special Envoy with the rank and sta-
tus of ambassador, pursuant to this 
amendment, requires the advice and 
consent of the Senate.

FOURTH OF JULY 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about our Nation’s 
independence. 
Some 244 years ago this Saturday, 
the Founding Fathers of this country 
voted to declare our independence from 
Great Britain. 
All Americans know the basics of 
this story, but not everyone knows the 
story behind one of our Nation’s found-
ing documents. 
Thomas Jefferson was just 33 years 
old when the Second Continental Con-
gress commissioned him to draft a dec-
laration of independence. When he sat 
down in a rented room in the heat of 
the Philadelphia summer to write it, 
the American Revolution had already 
begun. 
On one level, he was simply putting 
the 
reasons 
for 
independence 
into 
words. The first shot had been fired 
over a year earlier, after decades of in-
creasingly tyrannical British abuses 
had culminated in open revolt in Mas-
sachusetts. 
Even so, it was not yet clear whether 
the delegates from all 13 colonies 
would put their names to a formal doc-
ument 
declaring 
our 
independence. 
They had to be persuaded. 
After 17 days of writing and rewrit-
ing, struggling to find the right words, 
Jefferson presented his work to Ben-
jamin Franklin and John Adams. He 
then submitted a draft to the Congress 
on July 1, which officially adopted it 
three days later. 
Each year on the Fourth of July, we 
celebrate this moment—the moment 
that we declared our independence 
from the British Empire and began to 
see ourselves as our own nation. 
I love Independence Day celebrations 
in Nebraska. Like many people, my 
family often spends the day enjoying 
the 
great 
outdoors 
before 
hosting 
friends and neighbors for a barbecue. 
But the Fourth of July is about more 
than food and fireworks or parades and 
pancake feeds. It is an opportunity to 
reflect on the nearly two and a half 
centuries of our nation’s history and 
remember what it means to be an 
American. 
To me, America is a nation based on 
an idea. It is the idea, as Jefferson 
wrote, that ‘‘all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable Rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty and the 
pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
Belief in this creed is what unites us 
as Americans. And while we may not 
always live up to this idea, we can 
never stop trying. We should count 
ourselves fortunate to live in the great-
est nation on earth, where the notion

of equal justice for all first came into 
the world. 
I was touched to see that on June 22, 
36 people became American citizens in 
the first naturalization ceremony held 
in Lincoln since February. This diverse 
group of people renounced their loyalty 
to their former countries and took an 
oath of allegiance to the United States. 
Family 
and 
friends 
in 
attendance 
brought homemade banners, red, white, 
and blue balloons, and other patriotic 
displays. 
These 36 people, despite being citi-
zens for only a few weeks, are just as 
American as you or me. And these new 
citizens chose to be Americans. They 
weren’t born here, but they saw Amer-
ica for what it is: a shining city upon a 
hill, where our institutions, though 
they sometimes falter, strive to honor 
Jefferson’s promise of God-given rights 
and equal treatment before the law for 
all citizens. 
We are not perfect, but neither can 
we forget our founding purpose. The 
United States was the first nation in 
history to set this lofty standard for 
ourselves, and we remain its best ex-
ample. 
This Independence Day, as our coun-
try wrestles with both a pandemic and 
national unrest in the wake of the kill-
ing of George Floyd, I urge you to re-
member that we remain, as President 
Abraham Lincoln said during the Civil 
War, ‘‘the last best hope of earth.’’ 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor and note the absence of a quorum.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING MARNY XIONG 
∑Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise to honor the life of Marny 
Xiong, who served as chair of the St. 
Paul school board and was a beloved 
member of the community taken from 
us too soon on June 7, 2020. As one per-
son put it, Marny wasn’t just well- 
liked, she was well-loved. 
Those who knew Marny best de-
scribed her as someone with a joyful 
spirit who was great at making other 
people laugh. Mayor Melvin Carter of 
St. Paul may have said it best when he 
noted that she ‘‘embodied our city’s 
spirit, gave her heart to our students, 
and worked tirelessly to uplift the 
voices of the unheard.’’ 
The daughter of Hmong refugees 
whose parents fled Laos to a refugee 
camp in Thailand before arriving in 
Minnesota, Marny and her eight sib-
lings grew up in St. Paul and attended 
St. Paul public schools, Her father 
earned a high school diploma as an 
adult, opening career opportunities for 
him and showing Marny firsthand the 
value of education and hard work. 
Marny Xiong represented the best of 
us, driven by a simple mission to do 
good and to give back. As the chair of 
the St. Paul School Board, she de-
manded equity for her students—and 
fought for justice for all people across 
our State. During the Covid–19 pan-
demic that sadly took her life, she took 
on the fight against hate crimes 
against Asian Americans and hateful 
rhetoric about the virus. She stood up 
against these acts of hate that threat-
ened the lives and dignity of so many 
in Minnesota. 
Marny led St. Paul’s school board 
and Asian American elected officials in 
condemning xenophobia and denounc-
ing racism, saying: ‘‘While they brew 
hate, we’re building a powerful move-
ment for change.’’ Marny understood 
that there are more students to help, 
more teachers to respect, more com-
munities to support, and more justice 
to deliver. Marny wasn’t afraid or in-
timidated to take on these challenges. 
She was resolute and determined to en-
lighten those who engage in the poli-
tics of fear and division. That is 
Marny’s legacy and what we have in-
herited from her. 
Marny Xiong is a role model and an 
inspiration and will be sorely missed, 
but as we mourn her loss today, tomor-
row we can honor Marny’s legacy by 
building on the movement to which she 
committed her life, a movement to see 
a better, more just, vision of our com-
munities and our country, Marny’s 
movement. 
Thank you.∑

RECOGNIZING AMWAT MOVING 
WAREHOUSING STORAGE 
∑ Mr. 
RUBIO. 
Mr. 
President, 
as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. Today, it is my distinct honor 
to recognize a family-owned business 
that not only provides excellent mov-
ing, warehousing, and storage services 
but also prioritizes dignified work for 
its employees. This week, it is my 
pleasure to honor AMWAT Moving 
Warehousing Storage of Tallahassee, 
FL, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
AMWAT was founded in 1997 by col-
lege sweethearts Dean and Gloria Pugh 
in Tallahassee, FL. After helping sev-
eral friends move residences, the cou-
ple realized they had the potential to 
start their own business. Initially 
named ‘‘A Man With A Truck,’’ the 
business started as a one-man oper-
ation consisting of a pick-up truck and 
trailer operating out of Dean’s spare 
bedroom. Soon after, A Man With a 
Truck moved into a small warehouse, 
hired six employees and acquired three 
moving trucks. 
In 2008, Dean and Gloria acquired the 
largest, oldest moving company in the 
Tallahassee area and rebranded as 
AMWAT Moving Warehousing Storage. 
AMWAT has grown to include 26 em-
ployees and a 13-truck fleet. They pro-
vide long-term storage, handle shipping 
for local businesses, and provide ship-
ping services nationwide. Gloria serves 
as president and chief executive officer 
and Dean is the chief operating officer. 
AMWAT’s 
high-quality 
work 
has 
earned awards from business groups, 
including 
the 
Greater 
Tallahassee 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce, 
the 
Tally 
Awards, Angie’s List, and Wheaton 
World Wide Moving. Dean and Gloria 
are also active in the American Moving 
and Storage Association and the Pro-
fessional Movers Association of Flor-
ida. 
From the beginning, Dean and Gloria 
have understood that providing dig-
nified work is crucial to personal and 
community 
development. 
Through 
training, mentorship, and teamwork, 
they encourage their employees to feel 
a sense of ownership in the company 
and take pride in their work. At 
AMWAT, the employees are the most 
valued asset. 
Locally, AMWAT is committed to ad-
dressing 
poverty, 
upward 
mobility, 
education, and the arts. Their signa-
ture charity event is the annual Sum-
mer Fill-a-Truck Food and Fund Drive, 
which benefits the Second Harvest of 
the Big Bend. They have also partnered 
with ECHO, Junior League of Tallahas-
see, and LeMoyne Arts. 
Like many other small businesses, 
AMWAT experienced a sharp decline in 
revenue due to the coronavirus pan-
demic. When the U.S. Small Business 
Administration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program, PPP, Gloria and 
Dean quickly applied. The PPP pro-
vides forgivable loans to impacted 
small businesses and nonprofits who 
maintain their payroll during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. When their fund-
ing was approved, Gloria and Dean used 
it to keep their 26 employees paid and 
adapt their business procedures to 
meet public safety standards. For Glo-
ria and Dean, the PPP was a ‘‘blessing’’ 
and a ‘‘godsend,’’ providing the secu-
rity needed to continue serving their 
customers, employees, and community. 
AMWAT Moving Warehousing Stor-
age is an outstanding example of the 
important role small businesses play in 
creating dignified work in their com-
munities. I commend AMWAT for pro-
viding excellent moving, storage, and 
logistical services and uplifting their 
employees. Congratulations to Dean, 
Gloria, 
and 
the 
entire 
team 
at 
AMWAT. I look forward to watching 
your continued growth and success.∑

extreme actions being taken immediately, 
more irreversible damage will be done. 
In 2018, the United States emitted 6.5 bil-
lion metric tons of greenhouse gases into the 
atmosphere. This is an estimated 8.8% more 
than 1990. Between 1990 and 2010, the United 
States lost 949,750 acres of forest on average 
per year. The U.S. Department of Energy es-
timates that 1.9 million gallons of oil are 
spilled into U.S. oceans every year. 
Current studies show that the effects of 
climate change are more severe and are mov-
ing faster than was formerly predicted. What 
needs to happen is large scale environmental 
programs with legal incentives such as tax 
breaks, as well as punishments for not adher-
ing to the plans like jail time and loss of 
government funding or subsidies. The most 
accurate proposal of recent years is the 
Green New Deal. This proposal called for a 
World War 2 type mobilization of the coun-
try to achieve 100% clean energy by 2030. 
This plan also looked to better the economy 
by creating jobs in sustainable industries, 
unlike jobs currently involved in fossil fuel 
industries, as well as investing in renewable 
public transportation and clean organic agri-
culture. The first step to combating climate 
change would be to immediately adopt this 
proposal, yet in March of 2019 the proposal 
was rejected by a Republican controlled Sen-
ate. 
The very first step that should be taken is 
the readmittance of the U.S. into the Paris 
Climate Agreement. It is the duty of the 
United States to set an example for the rest 
of the world about how to combat climate 
change. An important idea is to make envi-
ronmental agencies as nonpartisan as pos-
sible, similar to the NLRB where the mem-
bers consist of nearly equal Republicans as 
well as Democrats at all times. This would 
ensure that decisions are made based on 
science instead of based on party ties and po-
litical affiliations. 
The most important goal being to make 
the United States completely carbon neu-
tral. A plan for most, if not all, energy pro-
duced to come from clean sources would be 
necessary to achieving that goal. Another 
necessity would be the implementation of 
programs designed to restore forests and 
wildlife. This would mean increased regula-
tion on logging industries as well as oil in-
dustries. With an increased punishment for 
violating these regulations. These initiatives 
would be able to transition Americans losing 
their jobs in fossil fuel industries into clean 
energy industries, which would be a sustain-
able alternative. Green jobs would have high-
er job security than fossil fuels due to the 
fact that there is a finite amount of coal and 
oil available to be extracted, once the planet 
no longer has these resources available all of 
these millions of workers will lose their jobs 
with no replacement. With a program like 
the Green New Deal, these workers will have 
jobs that do not have an expiration date. It 
is important to remember that those first 
and most heavily affected by this crisis, are 
people with lower incomes. This is not only 
an environmental issue, but also a human 
rights issue. 
It is up to all of us now to be able to pre-
serve this planet and create a stable system 
which will allow all generations moving for-
ward to prosper in a healthy environment. 
MEREDITH JACKSON, BURLINGTON HIGH 
SCHOOL, FRESHMAN 
One issue in Vermont that doesn’t get 
enough recognition is the cost of eating 
healthy. It isn’t affordable for many, and the 
expenses can even discourage people to eat 
healthily. If the prices are discouraging peo-
ple to eat healthily, then they might resort 
to unhealthier foods because they are cheap-
er and in more of the average price range for 
most. 
Healthy Living and City Market both have 
a goal to provide local farm-fresh produce in-
cluding prep items for healthy, nourishing, 
meals, and a selection of ingredients to cook 
vegan or gluten-free meals. Healthy living 
and City Market are great in that they pro-
vide fresh local produce, and for the quality 
that it is the prices make sense. On the 
Healthy Living website, the price for a con-
tainer of raspberries can range anywhere 
from $4.29–$5.69. That may not seem like a 
lot but at McDonald’s, you can get an entire 
meal for that much. That is just what many 
people choose to do, resort to cheaper op-
tions such as fast food. 
Unlike fresh produce and wholegrain-rich 
foods, fast food is quick, easy, and very 
cheap, making it ideal for people who can’t 
afford to shop at places like city Market or 
Healthy living. 
According to Gallup, 80% of Americans eat 
fast food on at least a monthly basis, and 
96% of Americans eat fast food annually. 
Fast food isn’t bad unless a person has it 
often, say at least once a week. Eating 
unhealthy foods, too often, can cause people 
to become overweight or even obese. Over 
99,000,000 adults in the U.S. are overweight 
and over 70,000,000 are obese. 
Obesity can cause many health issues that 
could have been prevented if that person 
were of a healthy weight. Some risks include 
high blood pressure, diabetes, gout, breath-
ing problems, such as sleep apnea and asth-
ma, Gallbladder disease and gallstones, Os-
teoarthritis, Heart disease, stroke, and even 
cancer. Maintaining a healthy weight and 
lifestyle will reduce the risk of many of 
these health problems. 
It’s not guaranteed that people become 
obese overtime because healthy food is too 
expensive, eating unhealthily isn’t the only 
factor that causes obesity, but it could very 
well be. If healthier foods were cheaper, it 
would be an option for more people and 
would encourage them to eat healthier re-
ducing the risk of obesity. Having the avail-
ability of healthy meals is important. 
A healthy diet is beneficial to your every-
day life in so many ways. Some benefits to 
eating healthy are a maintained/healthy 
weight, reduced risk of chronic illnesses such 
as cardiovascular disease and cancer, more 
energy, and an increase in happiness. Also, a 
recent study has proven that having a diet 
consisting of plenty of fruits and vegetables 
and limits highly processed food, can reduce 
certain signs of depression. 
This issue is very real and very important 
but thinking up solutions to this problem 
can be quite the challenge. There are a few 
solutions that seem doable and not too far-
fetched or unrealistic. 
First, expanding the fresh produce area in 
stores like Hannafords to give more options 
and kind of push out some of the unhealthy, 
overly processed items in the store. This 
wouldn’t necessarily make it less expensive 
but having more options might encourage 
people to shop in that section more often. 
Second, doing some more advertising for 
the Farm Share Program. The Farm Share 
Program 
provides 
limited-income 
Vermonters with access to high-quality 
produce on a weekly basis. The program 
helps hundreds of families get access to a 
season’s worth of farm-fresh produce by re-
ducing the cost of the shares. The program 
itself is already a solution to this problem, 
but I feel like advertising would be good be-
cause it would inform more people that they 
have that option. All they have to do is sign 
up. 
Third, and last, is more of something peo-
ple could do themselves or with a group of 
people, but people could start their own gar-
dens or start a larger neighborhood garden. 
This would provide people with plenty of 
fresh fruits and vegetables. All they would 
have to do is chip in a little hard work and 
time, then they could have all the free 
produce that was grown. 
Eating healthy is expensive because a lot 
of work goes into growing, and getting, that 
local farm-fresh produce into stores. Farm-
ers spend countless hours growing the crops 
from which it all comes from, people need to 
pick, sort, and wash everything, then, there 
is packaging and delivering. The list goes on. 
Another part is due to the fact that it is high 
quality, locally grown, and fresh. A lot of 
money goes into providing it, so a lot of 
money needs to be made in order for them to 
keep providing the produce to stores for ev-
eryone. The problem is big, the solutions are 
limited, but something needs to be done in 
order to provide farm-fresh products to the 
people of Vermont at a more reasonable and 
affordable price. 
CALEB MATOSKY, RICE MEMORIAL HIGH 
SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
As citizens of one of the wealthiest nations 
in the world, we have an inherent responsi-
bility to set an example for others to follow. 
America has failed to take action and ad-
dress what is perhaps the greatest threat our 
world has faced since the beginning of re-
corded history: climate change. If Americans 
continue to deny its effects, the future of our 
country will be put into jeopardy. Rising sea 
levels, more severe weather events, rampant 
wildfires, devastating droughts, and dis-
appearing winters are just a few of the ef-
fects of climate change we are already expe-
riencing. Skeptics and deniers might argue 
that America is taking enough action to 
fight global warming: this sort of lazy and 
selfish thinking is what has caused the 
American people and our government to 
allow climate change to occur uninhibited 
until the very end of the last century. If our 
government does not make drastic changes 
within the next several years, America as we 
know it could be forever changed. We have 
the money, we have the ability to implement 
changes, and all that remains is for law-
makers to place the future of our planet over 
their allegiance to fossil fuels. 
I propose widespread legislation to ensure 
that America is powered by 80% renewable 
energy by 2030, which would be a large step 
in the right direction for the future of our 
planet. We need to penalize those who profit 
off of destroying the environment through 
fossil 
fuels, 
as 
these 
energy 
producers 
produce more emissions per day than many 
people produce in a year. Through new laws 
which put a price on CO2 emissions, and gov-
ernment tax relief for those who produce re-
newable power, we can work to rid the earth 
of harmful coal burning. According to the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration, 
coal fueled power generation produces 1.15 
billion tons of CO2 each year. It is also the 
most carbon rich fossil fuel, producing 2.5 
tons of CO2 per ton of coal burned. Despite 
this, coal is still being used as the primary 
source of energy in America. This needs to 
change. Additionally, we need to take action 
to crack down on other nations who dis-
regard the state of the world’s climate, and 
ensure that nations such as China and India 
take responsibility for their role in the issue. 
The United States is the wealthiest nation 
in the world, and if only a fraction of our 
military budget was used to invest in the fu-
ture of our environment, the future of 
younger generations and the future of our 
species as a whole we might be able to pre-
vent many of climate change’s worst effects. 
There is no time left to wait, or to deny the 
challenges before us: we must take urgent 
action and do everything we can to lower 
CO2 emissions before it is too late.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Ms. BALDWIN, 
Mr. 
CASEY, 
Mr. 
REED, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. MARKEY, Ms. 
HARRIS, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. CAR-
PER, Mr. VAN
HOLLEN, Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, Mr. MERKLEY, Ms. 
SMITH, Ms. WARREN, and Mr. 
CARDIN): 
S. 4132. A bill to establish the Com-
mission on the COVID–19 Pandemic in 
the United States; to the Committee 
on Rules and Administration. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise 
to 
speak 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Coronavirus 
Commission 
Act. 
Rep-
resentative ADAM
SCHIFF
has intro-
duced companion legislation in the 
House. 
This bill would establish a commis-
sion on the coronavirus pandemic to 
better understand the vulnerabilities it 
has revealed in our national security 
and healthcare system and improve our 
preparedness for future crises. 
It is crucial to improve our under-
standing 
of 
pandemic 
threats 
and 
health issues that the United States 
could face in the coming decades to 
better protect our population and miti-
gate the risk of a similar human and 
economic catastrophe. 
Nearly 130,000 Americans have died 
from COVID–19. Hospitals have strug-
gled to secure enough personal protec-
tive equipment to keep health workers 
safe, testing levels remain inadequate, 
and a breakthrough therapeutic, let 
alone a vaccine, has yet to be devel-
oped. 
More than 41 million Americans have 
been laid off, and the unemployment 
rate is likely well over 20 percent. 
Large numbers of businesses have per-
manently closed due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
The commission that would be cre-
ated by our bill would conduct a com-
prehensive review of the government’s 
coronavirus response and make rec-
ommendations on how we can be better 
prepared in the future. The commission 
would complement other oversight ef-
forts in Congress and elsewhere. 
The coronavirus commission would 
examine U.S. Government preparedness 
in advance of this pandemic, the Fed-
eral Government’s response to it, and 
provide recommendations to improve 
our ability to respond to and recover 
from future outbreaks, epidemics, and 
pandemics. 
This legislation is modeled after and 
closely mirrors legislation enacted in 
2002 that created the 9/11 Commission. 
The Coronavirus Commission would 
be composed of 10 members, with the 
same partisan balance as the 9/11 com-
missioners and prohibited from being 
current Federal officials, with a vari-
ety of backgrounds in relevant fields, 
including public health, epidemiology, 
emergency preparedness, armed serv-
ices, and intelligence; provide a full ac-
counting to the President, Congress, 
and the American people of the facts 
and circumstances related to the out-
break in the United States, including 
our preparedness, the intelligence and 
information we had available before 
the virus reached the United States, 
and how Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments, as well as the private sector, 
responded to the crisis; hold hearings 
and public events to obtain informa-
tion and to educate the public; possess 
subpoena power to compel cooperation 
by relevant witnesses and materials 
from the Federal Government, as well 
as State and local governments; make 
specific recommendations to Congress 
and the executive branch to improve 
our preparedness for pandemic disease; 
have adequate staffing and resources to 
be able to complete expeditiously the 
monumental task at hand so we can be 
prepared for the next epidemic or pan-
demic to hit the nation; and the com-
mission would be established after Feb-
ruary 2021, hopefully when the pan-
demic has been overcome and after the 
presidential election. 
The coronavirus showed just how un-
prepared and slow we were to respond 
to a major outbreak, and that lack of 
readiness has endangered lives. 
We were unable to ramp up testing, 
we had insufficient safety equipment 
for doctors and nurses, and we lacked 
any kind of consistent Federal guide-
lines for States and cities.

S4139 
July 1, 2020 
We know this will not be the last 
outbreak, so a 9/11 Commission-style 
panel is necessary to fix these mistakes 
going forward and apply the lessons 
from this pandemic to future crises. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. 
Thank you.

By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself 
and Mr. WYDEN): 
S. 4143. A bill to extend the unem-
ployment insurance provisions of the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security (CARES) Act for the duration 
of the economic recovery, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on the main topic this morning, I am 
proud to support Senator WYDEN and 
Senator BENNET. As the number of 
COVID–19 
cases 
accelerates 
across 
much of the country, the economic toll 
of this pandemic continues to fall hard 
on American families and American 
workers. Over 33 million Americans—at 
least one-fifth of the entire work-
force—have now applied for unemploy-
ment assistance since the pandemic 
began. 
Democrats secured a crucial en-
hancement of that unemployment as-
sistance in the CARES Act—an extra 
$600 a week, which, according to a 
study by Columbia University, pre-
vented as many as 12 million Ameri-
cans from slipping into poverty. By the 
end of this month, those emergency un-
employment benefits will expire, but 
unfortunately the high levels of unem-
ployment will not. Without an exten-
sion of enhanced benefits, Americans 
struggling without work will have 
their legs cut out from under them at 
the worst possible time, in the middle 
of a raging pandemic. 
I am joining with my colleague, 
Ranking Member WYDEN of the Senate 
Finance Committee, to introduce a bill 
that will serve as both a short-term so-
lution and a bold long-term strategy to 
keep American workers and the Amer-
ican economy afloat. I thank Senator 
WYDEN for his help and Senator BENNET 
for his help. Together, we put together 
a very strong piece of legislation. 
Our bill, the Schumer-Wyden Amer-
ican Workforce Rescue Act, would do 
something very simple: It would tie the 
extension of enhanced unemployment 
benefits to economic data, not arbi-
trary political deadlines. As long as un-
employment remains very high—over 
11 percent—the enhanced benefits will 
stay in place. When unemployment 
goes down, the benefits will phase out 
appropriately. 
This automatic stabilization for un-
employment benefits would be one of 
the first programs of its kind, but at 
its core, this policy is basic common 
sense. When Americans truly need the 
benefits, the benefits will be there. 
When the economy gets better, those 
enhanced benefits will be reduced. The 
impetus for this legislation is common 
sense. We should not allow the eco-
nomic security of the American people 
to depend on the political whims of the 
legislatures—Federal or State. 
When we passed the CARES Act over 
2 months ago, Democrats knew the 
extra $600 in weekly unemployment as-
sistance was only a temporary salve for 
struggling Americans. We had hoped 
the economy would be able to bounce 
back and unemployment would quickly 
go down. Clearly, that is not the case 
today. 
Experts are warning us that the eco-
nomic drag from this crisis will take 
years, if not a full decade, to fully 
abate. Further action is very much 
needed and very, very necessary. But 
for months, Republicans have doubled 
and tripled down on their strategy of 
delaying action on COVID–19 relief leg-
islation. They have kept the American 
people needlessly wondering if the help 
they rely on will remain in place much 
longer. 
We need to take the next step and tie 
unemployment benefits to economic 
triggers that will ensure that so long 
as Americans are hurting, a safety net 
will remain in place—whether it is 
COVID–19 or any other economic dis-
aster in the future that causes unem-
ployment to rise. That is how you give 
the American people the kind of peace 
of mind they need that they will not 
needlessly fall into poverty this year or 
next year or the year after. 
No doubt, this is a new idea. It would 
be one of the first programs of its kind. 
But we need to take this bold step for-
ward to guarantee that the Federal 
Government 
effectively 
serves 
the 
American people in times of crisis. 
There is a long road ahead before the 
U.S. economy gets back on its feet. In 
many parts of the country, States are 
reimposing restrictions on businesses, 
restaurants, and other places of em-
ployment to halt a renewed spread of 
the disease. Americans will continue to 
wonder, when can I get back to work? 
I am proud to join my colleagues and 
champion this legislation to provide 
unemployment benefits for as long as 
Americans need them—provide unem-
ployment benefits for as long as Ameri-
cans need them. 
Before I yield, I want to thank my 
colleague Senator WYDEN
for cham-
pioning this legislation as well. He has 
been a leading and fierce advocate for 
this policy in our caucus, and I am 
both grateful and proud to stand with 
him this morning. I also thank Senator 
BENNET, who is always thoughtful and 
thinking on to the future—one of the 
first Members to alert this Chamber 
and the country of the disparities in in-
come and wealth distribution—and has 
had vital input as well. We thank him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4140 
July 1, 2020 
This policy is smart, it is timely, and 
it is forward-thinking. So it is no sur-
prise that my colleagues, Senator 
WYDEN—one of the authors—and Sen-
ator BENNET have had great input. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Senator WYDEN and then Sen-
ator BENNET be allowed to speak imme-
diately after me for as much time as 
they may consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is a 
pleasure to be with Senator SCHUMER 
to advance the Schumer-Wyden legisla-
tive proposal today, and I am very 
pleased that we are joined by Senator 
BENNET, a particularly valuable mem-
ber of the Senate Finance Committee, 
who has worked on these issues for 
many, many years. 
As Senator SCHUMER outlined, we are 
talking about a fresh approach as we 
look to extending supercharged unem-
ployment benefits for as long as our 
economy suffers under the COVID–19 
pandemic. As the ranking Democrat on 
the Finance Committee that produced 
the $600 extra benefit each week until 
July 31 and the breakthrough to cover 
for the first time gig workers and the 
self-employed and part-timers and oth-
ers, I am going to take a few minutes 
to explain why this next step to create 
a dependable safety net in America is a 
no-brainer. 
We know that tens of millions of 
Americans are out of work due to 
COVID–19. The pandemic is, in fact, 
getting worse. Dr. Tony Fauci yester-
day talked about the prospect of hav-
ing 100,000 new confirmed cases per day 
nationwide. We don’t even want to 
imagine what the unemployment situa-
tion is going to look like with 100,000 
new coronavirus cases every day. You 
cannot have a healthy economy in a 
country suffering from mass death. 
I know the President got up in the 
Rose Garden and celebrated the last 
jobs report like it was the greatest 
news since the end of World War II, but 
you have to be living in a country club 
fantasy land to believe this economic 
crisis is anywhere close to ending. 
Tens of millions of Americans today 
are out of work in States with COVID 
hotspots. There are reports that people 
who went back to work in the spring 
are getting laid off for a second time. 
The numbers show that it dispropor-
tionately harms Black and Hispanic 
people suffering in this crisis, and the 
layoffs are hitting those Americans es-
pecially hard in industries that pay 
modest wages. This is a recipe for in-
justice and for long-term economic 
hardship. Our proposal is desperately 
needed because the country is not on a 
straight line to recovery. 
Democrats 
demanded 
the 
super-
charged unemployment benefits be-
cause workers are not to blame for the 
crisis. Doctors don’t yet have a cure for 
COVID–19, but the Congress does have a 
way to address the financial strain of 
joblessness. That is why Democrats de-
manded full wage replacement during 
the negotiations on unemployment 
benefits in the CARES Act. 
Secretary Scalia told those of us ne-
gotiating this issue that State UI sys-
tems—unemployment 
systems—were 
too outdated to make it work anytime 
soon. These are Federal benefits, but 
under employment law, the States ad-
minister the program and get the bene-
fits out. 
We knew that there would be some 
challenges, and we proposed a simple 
solution: $600 extra per week across the 
board, adding up to full wage replace-
ment for the typical worker. It was 
clear that was the only possibility of 
getting the supercharged benefits out 
to millions of workers quickly. 
It hadn’t been easy. In a number of 
States, the unemployment systems run 
on Bronze Age technology. In some 
other cases—and Leader SCHUMER and I 
are inquiring into these right now—it 
is a case of Republican sabotage. That 
is why, for the long term, it is cer-
tainly worth looking at a Federal ap-
proach for administering unemploy-
ment benefits as a better strategy. 
But in today’s economic conditions, 
dealing with the suffering we are see-
ing right now—the suffering that Tony 
Fauci talked about yesterday that 
could hammer this country from sea to 
shining sea—if you are dealing with to-
day’s conditions and you want to get 
full-wage benefits out on time, there is 
no alternative to $600 per week across 
the board. Furthermore, there is no 
good argument for cutting or elimi-
nating benefits as long as the pandemic 
is raging and getting worse. 
On the one hand, we heard Secretary 
Scalia and other Republicans repeat 
the old line. They have been talking 
against unemployment for ages, and 
they always say the problem is lazy 
workers dependent on government are 
going to drag the economy down by 
collecting unemployment instead of 
going back to their jobs. 
On the other hand, Republicans have 
repeatedly said the economy is roaring 
back to full employment so there is no 
need for extending benefits any longer. 
You can’t have it both ways. You can’t 
have it both ways, that these workers 
are dragging the economy down and 
then talk about how everything is 
booming. 
Regardless of how these arguments 
conflict, neither one holds any water to 
begin with. I believe it is an insult to 
American workers to say they would 
rather sit at home than work hard and 
earn their pay. Our workers have a 
strong working ethic, and how could 
anybody believe in the greatness of 
America, as the President is always 
talking about, and think so little of its 
workers? 
Second, it is time to quit pretending 
to know whether the crisis is anywhere 
near over. The number of people filing 
new unemployment claims every week, 
even now, is two and three times high-
er than the worst single week of the 
Great Recession. 
Senators have a right to stake out 
whatever ground they want on this 
issue. I will tell you, the American peo-
ple overwhelmingly support extending 
supercharged unemployment benefits. 
You see it in polls—polls done by cen-
trist organizations. But more impor-
tantly, you hear about it when you are 
home. 
Americans 
don’t 
buy 
Secretary 
Scalia’s line about lazy workers or de-
pendence on the government. I can tell 
you, based on the conversations I had 
with Oregonians, they don’t want any 
handouts. They understand the country 
is facing a severe historic crisis of job-
lessness, and they want the Congress to 
act. You cannot have a healthy econ-
omy in a country suffering from mass 
debt, particularly in the middle of a 
pandemic. 
It would be an act of sabotage and, I 
think, unthinkable cruelty to slash 
these benefits and send all these jobless 
families into destitution. That is why 
Senator SCHUMER and I have outlined 
this proposal to extend these super-
charged unemployment benefits in a 
manner that is tethered to economic 
conditions on the ground. 
We always hear our colleagues talk 
about policies and the need for policies 
that really mirror what is going on in 
the real-world economy, in the private 
sector. That is what this proposal does. 
This proposal says we are going to tie 
the economic benefits; we are going to 
tether them to economic conditions on 
the ground. 
I saw our colleague from South Da-
kota, a Member of the Republican lead-
ership, Senator THUNE, say that maybe 
the benefits ought to taper down when 
unemployment goes down. I looked at 
that, and I said that Democrats share 
that view. That is what our trigger pro-
posal is all about. You have to have 
them in a way that is going to make 
sure people can pay rent and groceries, 
which is what the $600 benefit made 
possible and will in the future. 
But 
when 
unemployment 
tapers 
down, then, under our proposal, we 
make an accommodation for that. 
What we are going to do is common 
sense. It provides certainty and pre-
dictability for American workers, but 
it will also send a message across the 
country that there is a policy that will 
make a more dependable safety net. 
Yet it will also do what the head of the 
Federal Reserve just said, which is to 
make sure that family budgets, which 
are the ones that drive the American 
economy, are ones where people can 
pay the rent and buy groceries. 
The bottom line is we have a moral 
obligation to not turn our back on 
those who are suffering. I am telling 
you, the Senate is going to go home 
here in a day or so for several weeks, 
and Senators are going to hear loud 
and clear that workers are concerned 
about whether, after July 31, they are 
going to be able to pay the rent and be 
able to buy groceries. I think they are 
worried, and I hear it from all parts of 
my community—about a tsunami of 
evictions and people simply not being 
able to feed their families. I think

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4141 
July 1, 2020 
those who disagree with the Schumer- 
Wyden proposal ought to come out here 
and say what they going to offer those 
people who are hurting. 
Influential objective thinkers about 
the economy, like Jerome Powell, are 
saying that these kinds of benefits are 
absolutely key to making sure that the 
family budget, which drives the Amer-
ican economy, is going to be positioned 
to pay the rent and buy groceries. 
I gather from Leader SCHUMER’s re-
marks that I can yield to our Senator 
from Colorado, a particularly valuable 
member of the Finance Committee, 
who has been working on safety net 
issues for many, many years. 
Mr. BENNET. I would like to thank 
Leader SCHUMER and the ranking mem-
ber of the Finance Committee, Senator 
WYDEN, for bringing this commonsense 
proposal to the floor. 
I have long advocated for the idea 
that we should tie benefits to the con-
ditions of the economy rather than 
simply politically convenient dates or 
inconvenient dates that don’t matter, 
don’t make any sense to working peo-
ple in our country, and create idiotic 
fights here that don’t help the people 
we all have been sent here, in theory at 
least, to serve. 
Right now, we are facing an unprece-
dented set of conditions in our country. 
We are being racked by an economic 
downturn. It is different from any that 
we have ever seen before and at the 
same time, we are facing this incred-
ible health crisis. One in six workers in 
this country is unemployed. One in six 
workers is unemployed today. 
But for once, thankfully, we were 
able to come together in a bipartisan 
way in March and pass the CARES Act, 
which is benefitting these workers in 
two ways. 
First, we expanded unemployment 
benefits to cover almost 10 million self- 
employed workers, gig workers, and 
others who are usually left behind in 
circumstances like this. That is some-
thing we should have changed a long 
time ago, but we finally got it done, 
and we did it in a bipartisan way. 
Second, as Leader SCHUMER and Sen-
ator WYDEN said, we added $600 per 
week to normal unemployment bene-
fits for all 30 million workers claiming 
benefits. That $600 weekly benefit has 
prevented a level of severe hardship 
that is almost impossible to describe. 
It has paid rent and prevented evic-
tions. It has kept food on the table so 
families don’t go hungry. It has kept 
the lights on and paid for the internet 
so our kids can learn. The bottom line 
is that the $600 weekly payment has 
been an essential lifeline to families in 
the middle of the worst economic crisis 
since the Great Depression. 
In Colorado alone, over 450,000 work-
ers are receiving the expanded benefit, 
and it has put a total of nearly $2.5 bil-
lion into our economy. Nationwide, the 
numbers are staggering. One analysis 
showed that these additional payments 
help keep 12 million Americans out of 
poverty and keep poverty rates from 
rising. Without these payments, wages 
across the entire economy would have 
declined by 10 percent from February 
to May. We completely offset that de-
cline. 
You know what that means is that 
working people actually were able to 
continue to buy things in this econ-
omy. The leader might be interested to 
know that I was talking to an econo-
mist recently, Raj Chetty, from Har-
vard, who has done a study, including 
other places, of New York. That study 
shows that the biggest loss in terms of 
consumer spending has come from the 
wealthiest areas in New York. That re-
sulted in the biggest unemployment. 
In other words, if you have a small 
business in a wealthy area in New 
York, your small business is cratering 
because wealthy people aren’t spending 
money on services because they are 
scared of getting COVID. 
In other parts of New York, there has 
been much less destabilization, and 
that is because of these unemployment 
benefits—directly because of these un-
employment benefits—because where 
the unemployment rate has gone up, 
people’s incomes have been able to be 
stable. 
I am the first to say that not every-
thing we have done with the CARES 
Act has been perfect. As we know, the 
CARES Act left out too many families, 
and too many States have been too 
slow to get these benefits out. That is 
the 
result 
of 
delivering 
benefits 
through 50 different systems that have 
been underfunded and undermined for 
50 years. But once they have gotten 
out, these benefits have made a trans-
formational difference. Everyone in the 
Senate should be proud of that. 
I come out here all the time and com-
plain how terrible this place is. I was 
amazed to hear the majority leader 
this morning talk about the ‘‘incom-
petence’’ of local officials. There is no 
body in the world more incompetent 
than this Senate. But here is a moment 
when we can actually be proud of some-
thing that we did here. Even President 
Trump has been running campaign ads 
touting these benefits. Even as he is 
running these ads—which, as Senator 
WYDEN said, he is running because this 
unemployment benefit is popular—he 
is threatening the take away the ben-
efit by allowing the $600 to sunset at 
the end of July. That would be a pro-
found mistake. 
Right now, even with these enhanced 
benefits in place, 17 percent of Amer-
ican families can’t cover 3 months of 
basic expenses. Without the extra bene-
fits, that number wouldn’t be 17 per-
cent. It would be 43 percent, almost 
half of the families in our country. 
Today, nearly 10 percent of Americans 
can’t make the rent. Without the extra 
benefits, that number would double or 
triple. 
If we let these benefits expire, we are 
going to throw tens of millions of 
Americans who rely on them into a 
profound financial crisis. We will be 
cutting their monthly income by $2,400. 
If we go over that cliff and completely cut 
off benefits, not only will it cut incomes by 
50 percent or 60 percent or 70 percent for lit-
erally millions of Americans who can’t go 
back to work, but it will cause extreme dam-
age to the economy. 
Nothing has kept our economy afloat 
more than this investment in unem-
ployment. Allowing these benefits to 
expire would remove $50 billion a 
month from the economy, reducing the 
GDP by 2.5 percent in the second half 
of this year. That would lead to 2 mil-
lion jobs lost and a significant increase 
in the unemployment rate. So we 
would be right back here again. We 
shouldn’t be doing that, at this point, 
with this very fragile economy and 
when COVID–19 is spreading in far too 
many places. 
Some of the industries are facing ex-
treme crises in my State as well as 
across the country. Hotels are pro-
jected to suffer revenue losses of al-
most 60 percent in 2020. Between March 
and May 2020, total restaurant sales 
were down more than $94 billion from 
expected levels, and 90 percent of inde-
pendent concert venues are at risk of 
permanently closing down in a few 
months without receiving additional 
relief. We can’t tell people who are 
working in all of these industries— 
when there is no way these businesses 
will even be close to being 100 percent 
in the near future—that they are just 
on their own. 
That is why we need to pass an ex-
panded unemployment benefit that 
continues after July. We should tie 
that expanded benefit to the unemploy-
ment rate, as Senator SCHUMER and 
Senator WYDEN have designed, so that 
it steps the benefit down as the econ-
omy heals. That makes sense. Nobody 
here wants to be in a place at which 
the 
unemployment 
benefit 
disincentivizes people from working, 
which is why they step it down, but it 
needs to stay in place until this econ-
omy heals. 
It is the wrong approach for the 
country and for the working people in 
this country to send them over the cliff 
right now, and it will be the wrong ap-
proach to send them over the cliff in 6 
months or even in 2 years if the unem-
ployment rate is still elevated. We 
need to extend expanded unemploy-
ment benefits, and we need to do it 
until the economy recovers. It is the 
right thing for the workers and fami-
lies who are wondering how they are 
going to get through one of the most 
difficult challenges of their lives. It is 
the right thing to do for the broader 
economy in order for it to come back 
as strongly as it can as we work toward 
a vaccine. 
I thank my colleagues again for their 
tremendous leadership. I hope that we 
will be able to work on this in a bipar-
tisan way, as we did before, and that 
we will be able to pass these extensions 
for the American people. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD.

tions to Israel; and

sion-guided munitions by Israel, in accord-
ance with existing requirements and prac-
tices regarding the export of defense articles 
and defense services, coordinated with the

fense resources by taking advantage of

S. RES 641 
Whereas, in 1898, Puerto Rico became a ter-
ritory of the United States and, the fol-
lowing year, Congress authorized raising a 
military unit of volunteer soldiers on the is-
land, which was organized as the ‘‘Puerto 
Rico Regiment of Volunteer Infantry’’; 
Whereas, in 1908, Congress incorporated the 
regiment as part of the regular United 
States Army as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Regiment 
of Infantry’’; 
Whereas, in 1917, after the United States’ 
entry into World War I, the Puerto Rico 
Regiment of Infantry was sent to Panama to 
defend the Panama Canal Zone; 
Whereas, in 1920, Congress redesignated the 
unit as the 65th Infantry Regiment of the 
United States Army; 
Whereas during World War II, the 65th In-
fantry Regiment served in North Africa and

France and Germany for which members of 
the unit received commendations for valiant 
service, including 1 Distinguished Service 
Cross, 2 Silver Stars, 2 Bronze Stars, and 90 
Purple Hearts; 
Whereas, in 1950, the 65th Infantry Regi-
ment deployed to South Korea, and during 
the voyage the soldiers nicknamed the unit 
the ‘‘Borinqueneers’’, a reference to the na-
tive Taı´no Tribe’s name for the island of 
Puerto Rico; 
Whereas during the Korean War, the 65th 
Infantry 
Regiment 
(hereinafter, 
the 
‘‘Borinqueneers’’) 
engaged 
in substantial 
combat operations on the Korean Peninsula, 
and the unit played a central role in several 
important offensives and counter-offensives 
that earned it well-deserved admiration and 
commendation; 
Whereas the Borinqueneers’ extraordinary 
service during the Korean War resulted in 
the Regiment receiving 2 Presidential Unit 
Citations (Army and Navy), 2 Republic of 
Korea Presidential Unit Citations, a Meri-
torious Unit Commendation (Army), a Navy 
Unit Commendation, the Chryssoun Aristion 
Andrias (Bravery Gold Medal of Greece), and

tions Counteroffensive, CCF Spring Offen-
sive, United Nations Summer-Fall Offensive, 
Second Korean Winter, Korea Summer-Fall

in numerous individual commendations and 
awards for its soldiers, including 1 Medal of 
Honor, 9 Distinguished Service Crosses, more 
than 250 Silver Stars, more than 600 Bronze 
Stars, and more than 2,700 Purple Hearts;

MONTH 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Ms. HAR-
RIS, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. 
BROWN, Mr. KAINE, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. 
JONES, and Mr. COONS) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 643 
Whereas spirituals, ragtime, blues, jazz, 
gospel, classical composition, and countless 
other categories of music have been created 
or enhanced by African Americans and are 
etched into the history and culture of the 
United States; 
Whereas the first Africans transported to 
the United States came from a variety of 
ethnic groups with a long history of distinct 
and cultivated musical traditions, brought 
musical instruments with them, and built 
new musical instruments in the United 
States; 
Whereas spirituals were a distinct response 
to the conditions of African slavery in the 
United States and expressed the longing of 
slaves for spiritual and bodily freedom, for 
safety from harm and evil, and for relief 
from the hardships of slavery; 
Whereas jazz, arguably the most creative 
and complex music that the United States 
has produced, combines the musical tradi-
tions of African Americans in New Orleans 
with the creative flexibility of blues music; 
Whereas masterful trumpeters Louis Arm-
strong and Miles Davis achieved national 
and international recognition with the suc-
cess of ‘‘West End Blues’’ by Louis Arm-
strong in the 1920s and ‘‘So What’’ by Miles 
Davis in the late 1950s; 
Whereas talented jazz pianist and vocalist 
Nathaniel Adams Coles recorded more than 
150 singles and sold more than 50,000,000 
records; 
Whereas the talent of Ella Fitzgerald, a 
winner of 13 Grammys, is epitomized by a 
rendition of ‘‘Summertime’’, a bluesy record 
accompanied by melodic vocals; 
Whereas Natalie Cole, the daughter of Na-
thaniel Adams Coles, achieved musical suc-
cess in the mid-1970s as a rhythm and blues 
artist with the hits ‘‘This Will Be’’ and ‘‘Un-
forgettable’’; 
Whereas, in the 1940s, bebop evolved 
through jam sessions, which included trum-
peter Dizzy Gillespie and the alto saxo-
phonist Charlie Parker, that were held at 
clubs in Harlem, New York, such as Minton’s 
Playhouse; 
Whereas earlier classical singers such as 
Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, one of the first 
widely known African-American vocalists, 
and other early African-American singing 
pioneers, including Nellie Mitchell Brown, 
Marie Selika Williams, Rachel Walker Tur-
ner, Marian Anderson, and Flora Batson Ber-
gen, paved the way for the female African- 
American concert singers who have achieved 
great popularity during the last 50 years; 
Whereas the term ‘‘rhythm and blues’’ 
originated in the late 1940s as a way to de-
scribe recordings marketed to African Amer-
icans and replaced the term ‘‘race music’’;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4146 
July 1, 2020 
Whereas lyrical themes in rhythm and 
blues often encapsulate the African-Amer-
ican experience of pain, the quest for free-
dom, joy, triumphs and failures, relation-
ships, economics, and aspiration and were 
popularized by artists such as Ray Charles, 
Ruth Brown, Etta James, and Otis Redding; 
Whereas soul music originated in the Afri-
can-American community in the late 1950s 
and early 1960s, combines elements of Afri-
can-American gospel music, rhythm and 
blues, and jazz, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Aretha Franklin, James Brown, 
Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Bill Withers, and 
Jackie Wilson; 
Whereas Motown, founded as a record label 
in 1959, evolved into a distinctive style 
known for the ‘‘Motown Sound’’, a blend of 
pop and soul musical stylings made popular 
by prominent Black artists such as Marvin 
Gaye, James Mason, and Mary Wells; 
Whereas, in the early 1970s, the musical 
style of disco emerged and was popularized 
by programs such as Soul Train and by art-
ists such as Donna Summer; 
Whereas reggae is a genre of music that 
originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s and 
incorporates some of the musical elements of 
rhythm and blues, jazz, mento, calypso, and 
African music, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Bob Marley; 
Whereas rock and roll was developed from 
African-American musical styles such as 
gospel and rhythm and blues and was popu-
larized by artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo 
Diddley, Little Richard, and Jimi Hendrix; 
Whereas rap, arguably the most complex 
and influential form of hip-hop culture, com-
bines blues, jazz, and soul, elements of the 
African-American musical tradition, with 
Caribbean calypso, dub, and dance hall 
reggae; 
Whereas the development and popularity of 
old style rap combined confident beats with 
wordplay and storytelling, highlighting the 
struggle of African-American youth growing 
up in underresourced neighborhoods; 
Whereas contemporary rhythm and blues, 
which originated in the late 1970s and com-
bines elements of pop, rhythm and blues, 
soul, funk, hip hop, gospel, and electronic 
dance music was popularized by artists such 
as Whitney Houston and Aaliyah; 
Whereas Prince Rogers Nelson, who was 
known for electric performances and a wide 
vocal range, pioneered music that integrated 
a wide variety of styles, including funk, 
rock, contemporary rhythm and blues, new 
wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop; 
Whereas a recent study by the Department 
of Education found that only 28 percent of 
African-American students receive any kind 
of arts education; 
Whereas African-American students scored 
the lowest of all ethnicities in the most re-
cent National Assessment for Educational 
Progress arts assessment; 
Whereas students who are eligible for the 
school lunch program established under the 
Richard B. Russell National School Lunch 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) have significantly 
lower scores on the music portion of the Na-
tional Assessment for Educational Progress 
arts assessment than students who are ineli-
gible for that program, which suggests that 
students in low-income families are dis-
advantaged in the subject of music; 
Whereas a recent study found that— 
(1) nearly 2⁄3 of music ensemble students 
were White and middle class, and only 15 per-
cent of those students were African-Amer-
ican; and 
(2) only 7 percent of music teacher licen-
sure candidates were African-American; and 
Whereas students of color face many bar-
riers to accessing music education and train-
ing, especially students in large urban public 
schools: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes— 
(A) the contributions of African Americans 
to the musical heritage of the United States; 
(B) the wide array of talented and popular 
African-American 
musical 
artists, 
com-
posers, songwriters, and musicians who are 
underrecognized for contributions to music; 
(C) the achievements, talent, and hard 
work of African-American pioneer artists 
and the obstacles that those artists over-
came to gain recognition; 
(D) the need for African-American students 
to have greater access to, and participation 
in, music education in schools across the 
United States; and 
(E) Black History Month and African- 
American Music Appreciation Month as an 
important time— 
(i) to celebrate the impact of the African- 
American musical heritage on the musical 
heritage of the United States; and 
(ii) to encourage greater access to music 
education so that the next generation may 
continue to greatly contribute to the musi-
cal heritage of the United States; and 
(2) designates June 2020 as ‘‘African-Amer-
ican Music Appreciation Month’’.

submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs: 
S. RES. 644 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
is, by law, ‘‘a basic and fundamental service 
provided to the people by the Government of 
the United States, authorized by the Con-
stitution, created by Act of Congress, and 
supported by the people’’; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
is obligated under the law to ‘‘provide 
prompt, reliable, and efficient services to pa-
trons in all areas’’ and ‘‘render services to 
all communities’’, in such a way so that ‘‘the 
costs of the Postal Service shall not be ap-
portioned to impair the overall value of such 
service to the people’’; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
maintains a universal network that connects 
all rural, suburban, and urban communities 
in the United States; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
carries necessary correspondence and goods 
to each community, including prescriptions 
and critical medications; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
uniquely serves ‘‘the last mile’’, delivering 
to every business and residential customer 
not fewer than 6 days per week; 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
helps small businesses stay connected with 
their customers no matter where they live; 
Whereas more than 630,000 employees work 
for the United States Postal Service, includ-
ing more than 97,000 military veterans, to 
carry out this mission; and 
Whereas the United States Postal Service 
is at the center of the mailing industry, 
which generates $1,600,000,000,000 annually 
and employs approximately 7,300,000 individ-
uals in the United States: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Sen-
ate— 
(1) that the United States Postal Service— 
(A) should not close post offices or facili-
ties, especially in areas that would otherwise 
lack access to the services these facilities 
provide; 
(B) should not reduce its standards of serv-
ice, or prevent individuals and businesses in 
every community from receiving their mail 
expediently and predictably; 
(C) should not unduly or excessively raise 
the prices of its products or services in such 
a way as to jeopardize the affordability and 
accessibility of such products and services in 
each community across the nation; and 
(D) should maintain prompt, reliable, and 
efficient services to all patrons affordably, 
as required under the law and by the people 
of the United States; and 
(2) that Congress should appropriate funds 
to offset lost revenues of the United States 
Postal Service during the COVID–19 emer-
gency and should take all appropriate meas-
ures to ensure the United States Postal 
Service maintains its services and remains 
an accessible, independent establishment of 
the Federal Government.

suring public dissemination of, and access to,

states of emergency to violate or otherwise 
restrict the human rights of citizens, incon-

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SUR-
FACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 2 and look forward to working with my 
colleagues to strengthen and improve this leg-
islation as it moves through the legislative 
process. 
I thank the Chairs of the various committees 
who have worked hard and tirelessly to put 
this legislation together. 
My colleagues may have noticed that over 
the past few weeks demonstrators of all colors 
and creeds have taken to the streets to press 
for changes in our country caused by systemic 
racism. While it was police brutality that 
brought them to the streets, let’s be clear that 
these inequalities span across all institutions 
of our society. 
One area where this systemic discrimination 
has been long known is in federal transpor-
tation funding. For much too long, good ol’ 
boys networks have held tight the rein on this 
funding so that qualified small businesses 
owned by minorities and women have been 
left on the sideline. Even today, their participa-
tion is far too low, even as we celebrate some 
progress. Report after report continue to find 
systemic barriers, such as access to capital, 
that leave these businesses hard pressed to 
compete for these funds. 
Economic disempowerment is one of the 
most crippling effects of the systemic and in-
stitutional racism that has gripped this country. 
When businesses owned by minorities are ex-
cluded or have to jump through so many 
hoops as to be effectively excluded from being 
able to fairly compete for and undertake the 
billions of dollars in transportation funding we 
distribute every year, then we have a problem. 
A big problem. 
Policies to promote equity and end systemic 
racism in America must not overlook the trans-
portation sector. We must continue to prioritize 
tearing down barriers that limit the ability to 
win work because of the color of the skin of 
the owner or owners or gender or any other 
form of unlawful discrimination when advanc-
ing transportation legislation. 
With so many literally crying out in our 
streets across our nation for Congress to act 
boldly and strongly to address inequalities that 
are so entrenched and pervasive, particularly 
against women and people of color, this bill 
marks a great opportunity to move the ball for-
ward. Unfortunately, while H.R. 2 today recog-
nizes the historic discrimination in the trans-
portation industry that has left qualified 
businesss owned by minorities and women 
behind, and I applaud those steps, it overalls 
punts on trying to help ensure a fair and com-
petitive process for winning work on the $1.5 
trillion in funding authorized in this legislation. 
Even as the DOT Inspector General, GAO, 
and others continue to identify problems with 
existing programs (much less make rec-
ommendations about ways to improve them) 
that hinder their effectiveness, including grant-
ees supplying incorrect data, problems with 
certification, and much more, this bill largely 
stands pat with the status quo. I am dis-
appointed that some amendments to try and 
improve existing programs to address identi-
fied problems were not made in order. 
The status quo is unacceptable. We need to 
take every opportunity to tear down systemic 
racism and discrimination, including that found 
in our transportation and infrastructure sector. 
If the federal government is unwilling to lead 
in this area, who will? 
I include in the RECORD a letter that I au-
thored, and which 40 of my colleagues joined, 
to the House Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee earlier this Congress asking for an 
infrastructure package that helps ensure a 
level playing field for these qualified busi-
nesses. 
At the end of the day, what these commu-
nities desire is not a promise of hearings or 
more excuses about why we have to be care-
ful here, but the opportunity for all commu-
nities to compete on a fair, impartial, and unbi-
ased basis for federal transportation dollars 
that they, as taxpayer, contribute to. It is clear 
that even today, that is not the reality. We 
need to dismantle the institutional barriers that 
stack the odds against these qualified busi-
nesses. 
Again, I support the level of investment in 
this bill. I support the plus-ups for public trans-
portation, water, rail, and to combat climate 
change. Those are critical changes that will 
help improve infrastructure and address real 
needs in our communities. 
And while I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill, and will vote for it, I also want to 
make clear that there is more work to do here 
to heed the voices that have taken to our 
streets and are screaming out today to end 
racism in all its forms, in all aspects of our so-
ciety. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, February 8, 2019. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, House Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: As you put to-
gether an infrastructure package, we write 
to urge you to take steps to ensure that mi-
nority contractors can fully participate in 
all projects funded by any proposal in the 
116th Congress. We urge the inclusion of 
funding and provisions in any such proposal 
that help facilitate the certification of these 
contractors as well as to support their abil-
ity to fairly compete and win work. Addi-
tionally, we urge you to ensure that all hear-
ings on an infrastructure package in the 
116th Congress include the voices and view-
points of minority contractors who can tes-
tify to the ongoing challenges they face in 
competing for and winning work on federally 
funded infrastructure projects. 
Transportation projects mean jobs and 
businesses for communities across our na-
tion and ensuring that all businesses in our 
communities, including small and disadvan-
taged concerns owned businesses, must re-
main a priority. 
Unfortunately, too often, the promises pro-
vided by federal law and regulations regard-
ing minority contractor participation in fed-
erally funded infrastructure projects fall 
well short of the reality. Despite some suc-
cesses, many states are still struggling to 
meet participation goals and requirements 
with their regular federal infrastructure 
funding, when such goals and requirements 
are attached. What these challenges do point 
out is the need for lawmakers to continue to 
make forceful efforts to attack the histori-
cally and ongoing inequality when it comes 
to federal infrastructure contracting. 
I know you agree with us that a new infra-
structure package must benefit all stake-
holders, 
including 
minority 
contractors. 
Therefore, including the voices of minority 
contractors in the development of an infra-
structure package, including hearings on 
such a package, is a necessary first step. 
Hearing from these stakeholders will allow 
you to better understand existing gaps in 
federal and state participation requirements 
and help get to the bottom of the most fre-
quent complaints and problems. And the 
message you will most likely hear is that the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) needs 
to improve the effectiveness and oversight of 
its Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) 
program, including better enforcement. 
The DOT’s implementation of its DBE pro-
grams has been the subject of numerous re-
ports by its Office of Inspector General (IG), 
highlighting problems with the Depart-
ment’s various DBE programs including at 
the Federal Aviation Administration. One of 
the most glaring conclusions from the past 
reports is the IG’s conclusion that ‘‘[t]he De-
partment does not provide effective program 
management for the multibillion-dollar DBE 
program.’’ Before we pour billions more of 
federal transportation dollars through DOT 
to the states as a part of an infrastructure 
package or surface transportation reauthor-
ization, Congress should listen to, and then 
appropriately respond to, the needs and con-
cerns of stakeholders, including minority 
contractors and the IG. And any such pack-
age should incorporate their ideas about how 
to best construct a proposal to help ensure 
that all communities truly benefit and have 
a fair and equal opportunity to compete for 
the thousands of contracts and subcontracts 
that are likely to flow from that package. 
We also know that without pressure from 
Congress, long overdue but needed improve-
ment will not occur and these business and 
our communities will find themselves re-
maining on the sidelines, even as billions in 
new funding flow to communities nation-
wide. 
Again, as you move forward on con-
structing the infrastructure package that 
our nation needs, we must consider and ad-
dress the needs of these qualified but often 
overlooked businesses. The fact is that de-
spite repeated affirmation by Congress, some 
states still make no or limited efforts to help 
certified firms obtain DBE work on federally 
funded projects and in others, most certified 
DBEs never win any business should concern 
and trouble us as policymakers. 
Lastly, one step such legislation can take 
is to make clear that all infrastructure agen-
cies have a responsibility for implementing

and enforcing rules, guidance, and federal 
laws which require equal employment and 
labor opportunities in federal contracting 
such as Executive Order 11246 (Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity). That E.O. requires 
agencies to include certain nondiscrimina-
tion and equal employment opportunity pro-
visions in ’federal contracts, including feder-
ally assisted construction contracts. Unfor-
tunately, we are concerned that this Admin-
istration’s weak record and blatant attempts 
to roll back important protections enshrined 
in federal contracting law and regulations 
will have a disparate impact on minority 
communities and contractors. 
There is no reason why any package to in-
vest in our infrastructure in order to foster 
a safe and modem transportation system 
should not also help small businesses like 
yours. These are not conflicting goals; it ac-
tually makes good and sound economic and 
transportation policy. 
As Members of Congress who care deeply 
about ending unequal access to federal con-
tracts and addressing our nation’s glaring in-
frastructure needs, we hope you understand 
the need to make sure both goals are met in 
any infrastructure package and will work 
with us to achieve them.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
SHERRY ABELOVE ON THE OCCA-
SION OF HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize my constituent Sherry Abelove, 
who is retiring this week after 31 years of 
dedicated public service. Sherry is a licensed 
social worker, who has devoted her career to 
serving the people of Maryland and Mont-
gomery County. 
After receiving her master’s degree in social 
work from Washington University in St. Louis, 
Sherry went on to receive her certification as 
a Licensed Certified Social Worker—Clinical in 
the state of Maryland. In 1989, Sherry began 
work for the Developmental Disabilities Admin-
istration within Maryland’s Department of 
Health. For 17 years, she served Maryland’s 
developmentally disabled residents and their 
families. 
In 2006, Sherry went to work for Aging and 
Disability within Montgomery County’s Depart-
ment of Health of Human Services, where she 
worked within Adult Protective Services to re-
duce the risk to senior citizens and those with 
disabilities. Sherry continued to dedicate her 
skills and experience to most vulnerable mem-
bers of the community and state. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
the extraordinary career of Sherry Abelove 
and hope that my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating Sherry on a dedicated lifetime 
of service.

CHANGE OF COMMAND AT NSWC 
CRANE 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Change of Command 
at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Divi-
sion. 
On 
July 
1, 
2020, 
Captain 
Mark 
H. 
Oesterreich will move on from NSWC Crane 
after three years of faithful service, and Cap-
tain Duncan McKay assume command. 
NSWC Crane is the world’s third largest 
naval base and is home to a variety of re-
search and testing projects that are critical to 
our national security ranging from hypersonics 
to Electronic Warfare is not only a key site for 
the Navy but also an important economic re-
source for the Indiana and the Eighth District. 
NSWC is the third largest employer in South-
west Indiana, and the Center provides nearly 
$2 million to Indiana’s economy each day. Ex-
cellent leadership at NSWC Crane is thus vital 
for both the Navy and the State of Indiana. 
During his time at the helm of NWSC 
Crane, Captain Oesterreich oversaw important 
progress made in all three of its focus areas— 
electronic warfare, expeditionary warfare, and 
strategic missions. More importantly, Captain 
‘‘O’’ successfully instilled trust and confidence 
in the sailors under his command. I am grate-
ful for his leadership during the past three 
years, and I wish him fair winds and following 
seas as he moves on from this command. 
Captain McKay comes to Southwest Indiana 
with tremendous experience that will make 
him an asset to NSWC Crane. After initial de-
ployments to the North Atlantic, Mediterra-
nean, and Persian Gulf, he served as the 
Battlegroup Operations Officer for Commander 
Submarine Squadron Eleven (CSS–11) in San 
Diego. He then completed graduate studies at 
the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and served in important logistical 
and maintenance roles. In his most recent 
tour, Captain McKay served as the Operations 
Officer at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. I look 
forward to working with Captain McKay as 
NSWC Crane begins a new chapter under his 
leadership. 
On behalf of all Eighth District Hoosiers, it is 
my 
pleasure 
to 
congratulate 
Captain 
Oesterreich and welcome Captain McKay to 
NSWC Crane.

LAREDO INTERNATIONAL RAIL 
BRIDGE 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to highlight an issue on our south-
ern border, at the Laredo International Rail 
Bridge, linking the United States to Mexico. 
This particular bridge is owned by the Kansas 
City Southern railroad. They are a crucial fix-
ture of the greater Kansas City area economy, 
employing more than 7,000 people and oper-
ating thousands of miles of rail network be-
tween the United States and Mexico. 
Trains that cross the Laredo International 
Rail Bridge in either direction are required to 
stop in the middle of the bridge and switch out 
the crews and perform various inspections be-
fore continuing. This often exacerbates the 
congestion at the busiest rail crossing on the 
southern border and leaves the sometimes 
miles-long trains blocking streets and high-
ways on both sides of the border. Moreover, 
it limits the number of trains that can make 
this crossing daily. Many of those trains are 
carrying 
agricultural 
goods, 
some 
being 
shipped from Kansas. 
I understand the difficult situation at this bor-
der and the importance of finding a solution. 
The current status of operations at the Laredo 
International Rail Bridge is inefficient, time- 
consuming, and a safety hazard. I am also 
concerned about alternate solutions that do 
not take our rail workers’ labor rights into ac-
count. I am committed to working with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to find a so-
lution that will protect workers’ rights and 
maintain safety, while also maximizing time 
and space so that our railroads can continue 
to be successful. Safety and efficiency are the 
watchwords in solving this problem and we 
need a reasonable and equitable solution.

HONORING PLEASANT GREEN 
MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Pleasant Green 
Missionary Baptist Church (PGBC), located at 
505 East College Street, shepherded by Rev-
erend Darrel McQuirter, as they celebrate 150 
years of religious service in the Clinton, MS 
community. 
On June 28, 1852, the First Baptist Church 
of Clinton was incorporated, ending that first 
year 
with 
fifty-six 
members, 
twenty-eight 
Whites and twenty-eight Blacks. For the first 
eight years, the congregation worshipped to-
gether on the Mississippi College campus in 
Clinton, MS. After the campus chapel was 
built in 1860, Blacks were allowed to worship 
independently in the chapel basement. Led by 
Mississippi College Professor Reverend T.A. 
Parrish and college president Walter Hillman, 
in 1867 a Sunday School was formed for the 
Black congregants. Pleasant Green Missionary 
Baptist Church was established in 1870 under 
the leadership of Reverend Dunbar, who was 
associated with Mississippi College. The col-
lege allowed Pleasant Green Missionary Bap-
tist Church (PGBC) to meet on the Robinson’s 
Athletic Field until property was purchased 
and a wood frame structure was built, incor-
porating stained glass windows at what is now 
505 East College Street. As time progressed, 
a brick building with modern amenities was 
erected. 
Currently, Pleasant Green Missionary Bap-
tist Church (PGBC), acknowledges the strug-
gles and accomplishments of the spirit-filled 
and faithful people and events of the past that 
have made a bright future for the current 
members. Now, the church’s legacy continues, 
ever growing and building, while striving to 
keep all plans within God’s will and reaching 
out to all people. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Pleasant Green Missionary 
Baptist Church (PGBC), as they celebrate 150 
years of service.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
90TH 
BIRTH-
DAY OF PROFESSOR JEROME A. 
COHEN 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Professor Jerome Alan 
Cohen, the Founder and Faculty Director 
Emeritus of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute of the 
New York University School of Law. Professor 
Jerry Cohen is a true champion of human 
rights and the rule of law in China and today 
he is celebrating his 90th birthday with his 
family and friends. 
Professor Cohen is one of the foremost ex-
perts in Chinese law and government and he 
also serves as a Senior Fellow for Asia Stud-
ies at the Council on Foreign Relations. He 
has provided sage advice and wise counsel to 
international leaders, U.S. government offi-
cials, and Members of Congress throughout 
his illustrious career including in testimony to 
the Congressional-Executive Commission on 
China. 
Professor Cohen’s extraordinary career on 
China began in the 1950s when he traveled to 
Hong Kong to interview with refugees and 
publish a book on Chinese criminal procedure. 
In the 1960s he created the East Asia Legal 
Studies Association at Harvard School of Law 
and was influential in securing the release of 
John T. Downey, a former classmate who had 
been held in a Chinese prison. In the following 
years he met with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai 
and accompanied Senator Ted Kennedy to 
Beijing to meet with Deng Xiaoping. 
Throughout the 1990s, Professor Cohen 
lived and worked in mainland China. After the 
Tiananmen Square protests, he established 
the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at New York Uni-
versity School of Law, dedicated to facilitating 
the development of the rule of law throughout 
Asia. As a strong advocate for human rights, 
Professor Cohen led the way supporting polit-
ical prisoners in China and helped secure the 
release 
of 
Song 
Yongyi 
and 
Chen 
Guangcheng. His former students include Tai-
wanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, and Annette 
Lu, former Taiwanese vice president under 
Chen Shui-bian. 
Professor Jerry Cohen has not only partici-
pated in the history of U.S.-China relations, he 
has shaped it. All those to advocate for human 
rights and the rule of law in China owe him a 
great debt of gratitude. Thank you, Professor 
Cohen for your exemplary service for human-
ity.

Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the honorable life and work of a be-
loved Alabamian, Mrs. Ann Varnum. Mrs. 
Varnum passed away on Wednesday, June 
10, 2020, after a full life of 80 years. A Dothan

ary 15, 1940, to the late Elizabeth and J.P. 
Jones. Mrs. Varnum attended and graduated 
from Huntington College and Auburn Univer-
sity with a degree in English. Following grad-
uation, she began a career in teaching before 
getting her big break at Dothan’s WTVY tele-
vision station. 
Mrs. Varnum devoted nearly 50 years to 
WTVY, working her way into the hearts of Ala-
bamians through her dedication to the commu-
nity, charming personality, and devotion to 
God. She is best remembered for hosting the 
station’s morning show, beginning in 1974 
until the late 1990s. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join

COMMEMORATING BRIGADIER 
GENERAL TODD CANTERBURY 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the retirement of Brigadier 
General Todd Canterbury. He began his ca-
reer in the Air Force after earning his commis-
sion from Arizona State University’s ROTC 
program in 1993 and is retiring as the Com-
mander of the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air 
Force Base, Arizona. 
Flying fighter jets is in his blood as General 
Canterbury is the son of the former Com-
mander of the 56th Fighter Wing—making 
them the first and only father-son combination 
to hold base commanding positions at Luke 
Air Force Base. 
In his 27-year Air Force career, he had 20 
assignments, was a graduate of the National 
War College, and served as a Command Pilot. 
He has more than 4,200 flight hours in the F– 
15 Eagle, F–16 Fighting Falcon, F–35 Light-
ning II, and MC–12W Liberty aircraft with over 
650 being combat hours defending our great 
nation. 
During his time in service, General Canter-
bury acquired a long list of achievements and 
awards to include the Defense Superior Serv-
ice Medal, Bronze Star Medal, multiple combat 
campaign medals, and more. 
I would also like to recognize General Can-
terbury’s leadership in making Luke Air Force 
Base the F–35 fighter pilot training head-
quarters, which created a partnership between 
the United States and NATO members to train 
their pilots on the F–35 aircraft. 
General Canterbury has not only made his 
family proud, but the United States Air Force, 
Arizona, and his country. We appreciate his 
selfless service and wish him the best in his 
next adventure. 
On this day, I invite my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the sacrifices that his family 
has made over the years and to thank Briga-
dier General Canterbury for his service to the 
United States of America.

SPEECH OF 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to say a few words about the Disadvan-
taged Business Enterprise—or DBE—Pro-
gram. While our progress toward equal oppor-
tunity for minority and women entrepreneurs 
has been slower than I would like, the DBE 
program is a big part of the reason we are at 
least moving in the right direction. In a recent 
study in my home State of Illinois, researchers 
examined business opportunities associated 
with the Pace Suburban Bus agency. This 
agency connects my district to the suburbs 
surrounding Chicago and also provides para-
transit services to people with disabilities. This 
study didn’t just examine Pace’s own spend-
ing, but also examined how businesses in the 
broader Illinois construction market are faring. 
This is very important because Pace operates 
the DBE program which at least opens the 
door to businesses owned by women and mi-
norities, while the broader construction market 
is dominated by the private sector which gen-
erally lacks such equal opportunity measures. 
The study performed regression analyses to 
determine what business earnings were for 
women and minority business owners even 
after adjusting for a number of factors such as 
education, age, occupation and industry. The 
results were startling: business earnings for 
Latino firm owners as compared to white male 
firm owners were 6 percent lower, for Asians 
they were 10 percent lower, for white women 
they were 19 percent lower, for Native Ameri-
cans and African Americans, they were 26 
percent lower. Pace Suburban Bus Disparity 
Study 2015, Colette Holt & Associates, 2015, 
at 96. These statistics make clear why it’s so 
incredibly difficult for women and minorities to 
get ahead in business—and why the DBE Pro-
gram is so necessary.

AFTER 
44 
YEARS 
OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Retirement of Po-
lice Chief Barry Barnard of Prince William 
County after 44 Years of Public Service. Barry 
Barnard was selected as police chief in 2016, 
and has served in the Prince William County 
Police Department since 1976. 
Police Chief Barry Barnard joined the Prince 
William County Police Department as an offi-
cer in patrol. Barnard served as an officer in 
patrol until 2000, when he was named an as-
sistant chief of police. In 2009, Barnard was 
appointed as the deputy chief of police in 
2009, and held the position of acting chief of 
police in 2012, before becoming Chief of Po-
lice in 2016. 
Police Chief Barry Barnard’s long history 
with the Prince William County Police Depart-
ment shows his dedication and loyalty to his 
community. Throughout his time as police 
chief, Barnard was committed to providing effi-
cient and interactive police service to the resi-
dents of Prince William County. He served as 
the final authority in all matters of policy oper-
ations and discipline. 
Barnard committed to the principles of integ-
rity and trust during his time with the Prince 
William County Police Department, and he be-
lieves that honesty and equality in delivery of 
police services is essential. Barnard is a 
strong example of what public service should 
look like, and he is leaving a strong and posi-
tive legacy on the Prince William County Po-
lice Department. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in recognizing Prince William 
County Police Chief Barry Barnard’s public 
service and dedication to his community in the 
First District of Virginia.

HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 29, 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the following letters: 
1. A letter on behalf of 600 organizations in 
support of the housing provisions included in 
the Heroes Act, which are the same provisions 
included in the bill we are considering today, 
H.R. 7301. 
2. A letter on behalf of over 800 national, 
state, and local organizations in support of 
H.R. 6820, the Emergency Rental Assistance 
and Rental Market Stabilization Act of 2020, 
which is also included in H.R. 7301. 
3. A letter from the National Urban League 
in support of H.R. 7301. 
4. A letter from the Consortium for Citizens 
with Disabilities Housing Task Force in sup-
port of H.R. 7301. 
5. A letter from the National Alliance to End 
Homelessness in support of H.R. 7301

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER PELOSI, 
AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: We, the 
National Low Income Housing Coalition on 
behalf of more than 600 national, state, and 
local organizations across the country, urge 
you to immediately enact the critical hous-
ing investments and protections included in 
the ‘‘Emergency Housing Protections and 
Relief Act of 202Q’’ (H.R. 7301) and the 
‘‘Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus 
Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act’’ to ad-
dress the health and housing needs of Amer-
ica’s lowest-income renters and people expe-
riencing homelessness during and after the 
coronavirus pandemic. Every day that Con-
gress waits to enact this vital legislation, 
policymakers put millions of low-income 
people—including seniors, people with dis-
abilities, families with children, low-wage 
workers and other individuals who were al-
ready struggling to pay rent before the cur-
rent pandemic—at risk of eviction and home-
lessness. Without the protections and re-
sources in H.R. 7301 and the HEROES Act, 
our nation will see an increase in homeless-
ness as renters lose their homes. 
The ‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act (CARES Act)’’ included 
$12 billion in housing and homelessness re-
sources and other critical protections for 
low-income renters. This bill was an impor-
tant first step, but far more resources are 
needed to protect those individuals living on 
the brink. While the CARES Act’s stimulus 
checks and expanded unemployment benefits 
will certainly help, they only last a short du-
ration, many people with the greatest needs 
are facing challenges in accessing these re-
sources, and even those who were successful 
in receiving these benefits will still be se-
verely rent-burdened and at risk of home-
lessness unless Congress provides targeted 
assistance. 
Even before the pandemic, people of color 
were significantly more likely than white 
people to experience housing instability,

evictions, and homelessness, the result of 
centuries of institutional racism and eco-
nomic inequity. People of color will also 
likely experience greater burdens in the 
aftermath of the acute crisis. In addition to 
facing higher mortality rates, people of color 
are more likely to be impacted by job insecu-
rity, food insecurity, housing instability and 
homelessness. 
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE FUNDS 
To address these challenges, H.R. 7301 and 
the HEROES Act provide the full $11.5 billion 
needed to prevent and respond to outbreaks 
among people experiencing homelessness, 
who are at a higher risk of severe illness and 
death due to the disease. People who are 
homeless and contract coronavirus are twice 
as likely to be hospitalized, two to four 
times as likely to require critical care, and 
two to three times as likely to die than oth-
ers in the general public. If unchecked, as 
many as 20,000 people who are homeless 
could require hospitalization and nearly 3,500 
could die. This has enormous implications 
for individuals, their communities, and our 
already 
overstretched 
hospital 
systems. 
These funds are needed to minimize the num-
ber of people living in homeless encamp-
ments and congregate shelters and identify 
alternative space, including hotels, for isola-
tion and self-quarantine. 
NATIONAL, UNIFORM MORATORIUM ON EVICTIONS 
The HEROES Act and H.R. 7301 include a 
uniform, 12–month eviction and foreclosure 
moratorium policy to protect all renters and 
homeowners at a time when our collective 
health depends on each of us staying home. 
In the CARES Act, Congress instituted a 
shorter, temporary moratorium for only 
some renters and homeowners in federally 
subsidized housing. NLIHC created a search-
able database and map to help renters deter-
mine whether they are protected under the 
CARES Act, but these tools are not complete 
because not all data is publicly available. 
States and localities have also instituted 
their own eviction and foreclosure morato-
riums, creating a patchwork of responses— 
many of which expire in the coming weeks— 
that provides relief to only some and creates 
confusion that has allowed some landlords to 
move forward with illegal evictions. 
EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE 
To help keep low-income seniors, people 
with disabilities, families with children, low- 
wage workers, and other individuals stably 
housed, the HEROES Act and H.R. 7301 in-
clude the ‘‘Emergency Rental Assistance and 
Rental Market Stabilization Act’’ proposed 
by Senator Sherrod Brown (D–OH), Congress-
woman Maxine Waters (D–CA), Congressman 
Denny Heck (D–WA) and 145 House cospon-
sors and 35 Senate cosponsors to provide $100 
billion in emergency rental assistance. 
Research from the National Low Income 
Housing Coalition estimates that at least 
$100 billion in emergency rental assistance is 
needed. Emergency rental assistance pro-
vides direct support to renters in need—in-
cluding those who have lost jobs or wages 
due to the pandemic—to help them shelter in 
place and avoid housing instability. A mora-
torium on evictions offers renters some im-
portant protections, but rent arrears will ac-
cumulate. People who have lost income as a 
result of the pandemic will struggle to cover 
large sums of back-rent once it comes due. 
Without emergency rental assistance, these 
households will face the destabilizing im-
pacts of evictions and, in worst cases, home-
lessness, 
with 
enormous 
negative 
con-
sequences for individuals, their commu-
nities, and our economy. Emergency rental 
assistance is also necessary to ensure the 
continued viability of our country’s essential 
affordable housing infrastructure. 
The HEROES Act and H.R. 7301 also pro-
vide an additional $13 billion to further ad-
dress housing instability, including 100,000 
new emergency housing vouchers targeted to 
people with the greatest needs, including 
people experiencing or at risk of homeless-
ness and survivors of domestic violence. 
We urge you to immediate enact to imme-
diately provide the critical resources and 
protections included in H.R. 7301 and the HE-
ROES Act to prevent evictions and home-
lessness 
and 
promote 
housing 
stability 
among those individuals with the greatest 
needs during and after this crisis.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER PELOSI, 
AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: We, the 
National Low Income Housing Coalition on 
behalf of more than 800 national, state, and 
local organizations across the country, urge 
you to address in the next coronavirus relief 
package the urgent health and housing needs 
of America’s lowest-income renter house-
holds—8 million of which were struggling to 
pay rent and make ends meet before the cur-
rent coronavirus pandemic and who now are 
facing increased risks of evictions and home-
lessness. To avert a surge in evictions and 
homelessness, we urge you to include in any 
comprehensive coronavirus relief package 
the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental 
Market Stabilization Act proposed by Sen-
ator Sherrod Brown (D–OH), Congressman 
Denny Heck (D–WA), and Congresswoman 
Maxine Waters (D–CA) to provide $100 billion 
in emergency rental assistance to help keep 
America’s low-income seniors, people with 
disabilities, families with children, low-wage 
workers, and others stably housed during 
this crisis. 
The ‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act (CARES Act)’’ included 
$12 billion in housing and homelessness re-
sources and other critical protections for 
low-income renters. This bill was an impor-
tant first step, but far more resources are 
needed to protect those individuals living on 
the brink. While the CARES Act’s stimulus 
checks and expanded unemployment benefits 
will certainly help, they only last a short du-
ration, many people with the greatest needs 
are facing challenges in accessing these re-
sources, and even those who were successful 
in receiving these benefits will still be se-
verely rent-burdened and at risk of home-
lessness unless Congress provides targeted 
emergency rental assistance. Research from 
the National Low Income Housing Coalition 
estimates that at least $100 billion in emer-
gency rental assistance is needed. 
Even before the pandemic, people of color 
were significantly more likely than white 
people to experience evictions and homeless-
ness, the result of centuries of institutional 
racism and economic inequity. People of 
color will also likely experience greater bur-
dens in the aftermath of the acute crisis. In 
addition to facing higher mortality rates in 
their communities, the economic impact of 
COVID–19 will likely increase rates of job in-
security, food insecurity, housing instability 
and homelessness. 
Emergency rental assistance provides di-
rect support to people who have lost jobs to 
help them shelter in place and avoid housing 
instability during and after the pandemic. 
Temporary moratoria on evictions offer tem-
porary protections for some renters, but rent 
arrears will accumulate. People who have 
lost income as a result of the COVID–19 out-
break will struggle to cover large sums of 
back-rent once it comes due. Without emer-
gency rental assistance, these households 
will face the destabilizing impacts of evic-
tions and, in worst cases, homelessness, with 
enormous negative consequences for individ-
uals, their communities, and our economy. 
Emergency rental assistance is also nec-
essary to ensure the continued viability of 
our country’s essential affordable housing 
infrastructure. 
In enacted, the Emergency Rental Assist-
ance and Rental Market Stabilization Act 
would provide states, localities, territories, 
and tribes with flexible resources to provide 
direct support to households in need with 
short-and medium-term rental assistance or 
to cover up to 6 months of back rent and late 
fees. The funds may also be used to stabilize 
households by helping to address the cost of 
security deposits and utility deposits and 
payments, among other expenses. These 
funds are designed to reach people in need 
quickly and directly; half of the funds must 
be allocated to states and local governments 
within 7 days. The Emergency Solutions 
Grants program utilized in this legislative 
proposal was modelled by Congress on the 
Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-hous-
ing (HPRP) program created and used suc-
cessfully in the aftermath the 2008 financial 
crisis. 
We urge you to include in any comprehen-
sive coronavirus relief package the Emer-
gency Rental Assistance and Rental Market 
Stabilization Act to prevent evictions and 
homelessness and promote housing stability 
among those individuals with the greatest 
needs during and after this crisis. 
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, 
JUNE 29, 2020. 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES: On behalf of the 
National Urban League and our 90 affiliates 
across 36 states, I write to express strong 
support for the important housing assistance 
provisions included in the ‘‘Emergency Hous-
ing Protections And Relief Act of 2020’’ (H.R. 
7301). As Congress considers further legisla-
tion to help combat the many devastating 
economic impacts of the novel coronavirus 
(COVID–19) pandemic, passage of the sweep-
ing housing assistance measures included in 
H.R. 7301 will be crucial to ensuring that 
American families are given the tools they 
need to adequately navigate this unprece-
dented crisis. We urge members to vote in 
favor of this legislation when it comes to the 
House floor for a vote. 
As you know, the collapse of our nation’s 
economy due to the COVID–19 pandemic 
marked a formal end to 128–months of eco-
nomic expansion that started when the U.S. 
began recovering from the depths of the 2008 
financial crisis, and the beginning of another 
prolonged 
downturn. 
The 
Congressional 
Budget Office estimates that the COVID–19 
pandemic will shrink the size of the U.S. 
economy by roughly $8 trillion over the next 
decade. 
The worsening economic outlook will un-
fortunately lead to even higher unemploy-
ment, lower wages, and significantly less in-
come for working families nationwide, many 
of whom were struggling to make ends meet 
long before the pandemic hit. According to a 
May 2020 survey released by the Federal Re-
serve, nearly 40% of U.S. adults reported 
lacking enough savings or cash on hand to 
cover an unexpected emergency of $400 or 
more without needing to borrow. Addition-
ally, 32% of all U.S. renters reported being 
unable to pay their full rent last month 
while more than 4.2 million homeowners

needed to request forbearance on their mort-
gages due to COVID–19 related financial 
hardships. Without additional legislation 
from Congress, our nation may soon face un-
precedented levels of evictions and fore-
closures that will increase homelessness and 
ultimately many harm our economic recov-
ery. 
The housing assistance protections in-
cluded as part of H.R. 7301 are particularly 
important in light of the many financial 
challenges homeowners and renters nation-
wide will continue to face as a result of this 
pandemic. As such, the bill’s inclusion of $100 
billion for the creation of an emergency 
rental assistance fund aimed at helping rent-
ers meet financial obligations such as rent, 
property taxes, property taxes, and unpaid 
utilities will be crucial to ensuring a faster 
recovery for workers takes place after this 
pandemic has subsided. The extension of ex-
isting federal eviction moratoriums through 
at least March 2021 will also provide impor-
tant assurances for families faced with 
COVID–19-related financial hardships during 
these challenging times. 
As Americans continue to face economic 
circumstances that threaten their financial 
and housing insecurity, the bill’s inclusion of 
additional resources for federally assisted 
housing programs such as public housing and 
Section 8 will help keep them affordable and 
available to those who need them. Moreover, 
the dedication of $11.5 billion in funding for 
homeless assistance grants to help ensure 
that Americans experiencing homelessness 
during this difficult time will also be able to 
receive access to the necessary health serv-
ices 
they 
need 
while 
following 
social 
distancing guidance rules. 
As the outbreak of the corona virus pan-
demic continues to bring about unprece-
dented declines in economic productivity 
across the entire U.S. economy, homeowners 
and renters nationwide will need help com-
bating the the devastating economic effects 
of this crisis. To this end, we are especially 
pleased that the bill includes$ 100 million in 
funding to the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development’s (HUD) Housing Coun-
seling Assistance program (Section 109) will 
be crucial to ensuring that Americans have 
access to the necessary housing information 
and resources they need to secure affordable 
housing or avoid foreclosure on their homes. 
We are especially pleased that the housing 
counseling provision in this bill is modeled 
after the National Foreclosure Mitigation 
Counseling (NFMC) program, which Congress 
created in response to the 2008 financial cri-
sis to assist homeowners who were at risk of 
foreclosure. As you know, the NFMC pro-
gram proved uniquely successful in helping 
stabilize U.S. households during the worst 
economic crisis since the Great Depression. 
In its 10 year reign, the program provided in-
dividualized counseling and education serv-
ices to more than 2.1 million Americans who 
needed advise on things such as how to re-
ceive a loan modification on their mortgage 
from their lender, avoid serious delinquency 
or foreclosure, or purchase a home. 
As one of a number of HUD-approved hous-
ing counseling intermediaries that received 
funding through NFMC, the National Urban 
League’s 90 affiliates across 36 states played 
a vital role in providing struggling families 
with services such as foreclosure prevention 
counseling, rental counseling, homelessness 
prevention counseling, how to and fair hous-
ing education. 
Homeowners and renters nationwide who 
are facing difficult economic times will need 
precisely this kind of advice on what their 
available options are for withstanding the 
difficult economic challenges that lay ahead. 
This is particularly true for minority and 
underserved potential homebuyers for whom 
housing counseling assistance has tradition-
ally proved immensely helpful when it comes 
to wealth-building and homeownerships op-
portunities. For example, from 2009–2015, 
over 12.2 million Americans received housing 
counseling assistance from HUD-approved 
counselor; 45% of those received counseling 
were were racial minorities while 71% of had 
low or moderate incomes. 
Housing counseling is particularly vital 
during times of crisis when unscrupulous ac-
tors in the financial marketplace typically 
seek to further exploit the most financially 
vulnerable in our society. For many families, 
being able to speak with a housing counselor 
to ask questions about how to avoid fore-
closure may be the difference between being 
homeless or staying in their homes during 
and after this unprecedented crisis. 
Given that the purchase of a home is still 
the single most significant financial deci-
sions most Americans will make in their 
lifetime, housing counseling should continue 
to be widely available to help families make 
better and more-informed decisions during 
challenging economic times. To this end, the 
National Urban League urges members to 
vote in favor H.R. 7301 when it comes to the 
House floor for a vote. 
Should you have any questions, please feel 
free to contact Julius Niyonsaba at the Na-
tional Urban League. Thank you for your at-
tention and consideration on this important 
matter. 
Sincerely, 
MARC H. MORIAL,

Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, Ranking Member, 
Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR WATERS AND RANKING MEMBER 
MCHENRY: On behalf of the Consortium for 
Citizens With Disabilities (CCD) Housing 
Task Force, we are writing to offer our en-
thusiastic support for the Emergency Hous-
ing Protections and Relief Act of 2020 (H.R. 
7301). CCD is the largest coalition of national 
organizations working together to advocate 
for Federal public policy that ensures the 
self-determination, independence, empower-
ment, integration and inclusion of children 
and adults with disabilities in all aspects of 
society; the CCD Housing Task Force focuses 
on expanding access to decent, safe and af-
fordable rental housing for people with dis-
abilities. 
H.R. 7301 is particularly well-timed in re-
sponding to the current COVID 19 pandemic. 
Many people with disabilities are especially 
vulnerable to increase rates of infection and 
death from the virus, and in need of stable 
housing options in order to stay safe and 
healthy. The extended moratorium on evic-
tion proceedings is crucial to preventing 
homelessness and housing instability. In ad-
dition, the inclusion of $200 million in fund-
ing for the Section 811 program will serve as 
a critical resource to expand access to af-
fordable rental housing for non-elderly peo-
ple with disabilities, and help existing multi-
family properties address the needs of their 
tenants to adhere to the CDC guidelines for 
self-distancing and quarantining when need-
ed. Overall, the package of housing-related 
provisions in the bill are urgently needed 
protect the people with disabilities and their 
families who are at risk during this pan-
demic. 
Thank you for your leadership in respond-
ing to the affordable rental housing needs of 
low-income Americans during this public 
health crisis. The CCD Housing Task Force 
urges all House Members to support H.R.

TO END HOMELESSNESS, 
Washington, DC, June 29, 2020. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, House Committee on Financial 
Services, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: On behalf of 
the National Alliance to End Homelessness, 
which is a nonpartisan, mission-driven orga-
nization committed to preventing and ending 
homelessness in the United States, I strong-
ly endorse the Emergency Housing Protec-
tions and Relief Act (H.R. 7301), a thoughtful 
and comprehensive approach towards ad-
dressing the serious health and economic 
consequences of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
which will be considered by the House of 
Representatives later this month. 
That this legislation was already approved 
by the House as part of the massive Health 
and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency 
Solutions (HEROES) Act (H.R. 6800) may 
make it anti-climactic to some. However, I 
commend you for seizing the opportunity to 
focus national attention during this public 
health emergency on homelessness and hous-
ing issues specifically, thus increasing the 
prospects that the federal government will 
provide additional meaningful assistance to 
homeless and unstably-housed Americans 
later this Summer. 
Your bill includes many helpful provisions, 
but please allow me to single out three: 
1. Section 201 would authorize an addi-
tional $11.5 billion in Emergency Solutions 
Grants (ESG) to help homelessness services 
providers 
safely 
shelter 
and 
quarantine 
homeless Americans and help a substantial 
fraction of them move into permanent hous-
ing. This is a natural extension of the bipar-
tisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Recovery Security Act (P.L. 116–136), which 
provided the homelessness system with a 
crucial $4 billion in initial ESG funding. 
Homeless Americans are twice as likely to 
be hospitalized, two to four times as likely 
to require critical care, and two to three 
times as likely to die than the general popu-
lation. Section 201 would allow providers to 
safely shelter homeless Americans in adapt-
ed or new facilities and quarantine the most 
vulnerable homeless Americans in motels. 
ESG would also be used by providers to pay 
for the additional staff required to meet the 
increased demand for services and the loss of 
volunteers due to the virus as well as the ad-
ditional supplies required during a pandemic, 
including 
testing, 
soaps, 
sinks, 
toilets, 
gloves, masks, personal protective equip-
ment, food, and cleaning supplies. 
ESG would allow providers to continue to 
serve 
unsheltered 
homeless 
Americans— 
those who cannot come inside, usually be-
cause of inadequate shelter capacity—which 
has never been more important because of 
public health concerns. However, such out-
reach has also become more difficult, more 
expensive, and more dangerous than ever be-
fore. 
Finally, ESG would allow providers to 
move a significant fraction of homeless 
Americans into permanent housing through 
rapid re-housing (RRH), a successful program 
that combines short-term rental subsidies,

help finding affordable rentals, and some 
case management. RRH is widely credited 
with a steep nationwide reduction in family 
homelessness. 
Among homelessness services providers, 
the operative maxim is: ‘‘it’s a marathon, 
not a sprint!’’ This pandemic will last well 
into calendar year 2021, and they know their 
workload will likely get even heavier. There-
fore, it is imperative that the federal govern-
ment sufficiently resource those providers 
through enactment of Section 201. 
2. Section 202 would authorize the estab-
lishment of $1 billion in emergency housing 
vouchers which could provide permanent 
housing to homeless Americans, those at 
risk of becoming homeless, as well as those 
escaping from domestic violence. With re-
spect to homeless families and individuals, 
specifically, these vouchers could be used to 
provide safe spaces to those most vulnerable 
to the virus—the elderly, the disabled, and 
the sick—who need deeper subsidies. Addi-
tional funding beyond what is provided here 
will be needed to ensure a permanent hous-
ing solution for all homeless people who are 
elderly or have serious disabilities, and we 
look forward to working with you to fulfill 
this need. 
3. Section 101 would establish a $100 billion 
rental assistance fund in order to prevent a 
wave of homelessness from sweeping across 
the nation and overwhelming homelessness 
services providers. Many renters, who were 
already spending unsustainable amounts of 
their incomes on rent, are incurring signifi-
cant arrearages during state and federal

BMW PRODUCES 5 MILLION 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, South Carolina has become Amer-
ica’s number one exporter of autos with the 
success of BMW and now enhanced with new 
Volvo production and Mercedes vans. With the 
vision of the late Governor Carroll Campbell 
who recruited BMW, thousands of jobs have 
been achieved at BMW and its suppliers. 
The achievements of 5 million produced by 
BMW was highlighted by The Columbia Busi-
ness Report of June 22nd: 
BMW MANUFACTURING PASSES PRODUCTION 
MILESTONE 
BMW has made 5 million vehicles in 
Spartanburg County. 
The milestone U.S.-made BMW is a red X5 
M Competition equipped with a 617-horse-
power M TwinPower Turbo V–8 engine, ac-
cording to a news release. It was completed 
June 5 and will remain at the factory to be-
come part of the BMW history collection. 
Others in the collection include the first car 
made at the plant. 
‘‘You cannot be successful in business if 
you do not have great products and great 
people,’’ Knudt Flor, president and CEO of 
BMW Manufacturing, said in the news re-
lease. ‘‘This BMW X5 M Competition is a 
symbol of the success of our products and 
the commitment and dedication of our asso-
ciates and supplier network. Every BMW X5 
in the world comes from Plant Spartanburg. 
We are proud to call South Carolina home.’’ 
More than half of the BMW vehicles sold in 
the 
United 
States 
are 
built 
at 
Plant 
Spartanburg, according to Bernhard Kuhnt, 
president and CEO of BMW of North Amer-
ica. 
‘‘We cannot overstate the importance of 
Plant Spartanburg to our sales network,’’ he 
said in the news release. ‘‘BMW Group has 
long considered the United States to be our 
second home and we are proud to say that 
the U.S. is in fact home to the biggest BMW 
plant in the world. We congratulate our col-
leagues on this historic achievement.’’ 
BMW celebrated 25 years of manufacturing 
in the Upstate last year, when it built a 
record 411,620 vehicles. Nearly 70% of the 
plant’s production was exported from 2010– 
2019. Last year’s value of exports was $9.6 bil-
lion, more than any other U.S. carmaker for 
the sixth consecutive year, according to the 
news release. The plant has expanded seven 
times, with $10.6 billion in investment, and 
has 11,000 workers on site. 
‘‘BMW changed the very fabric of our 
state’s economy when it decided to locate in 
South Carolina nearly three decades ago,’’ 
Gov. Henry McMaster said in the release. 
‘‘That this great company built its 5 mil-
lionth 
American-made 
vehicle 
in 
Spartanburg should be a source of great 
pride for our people and a reason for celebra-
tion. It’s one more example of South Caro-
linians sharing in the success of a company 
that has become an integral part of our state 
because of its dedication to our people.’’

HONORING ALEXANDER TWILIGHT 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the birth 
of a trailblazing Vermonter, Alexander Lucius 
Twilight, and to honor his legacy. Alexander 
was not only the first African American to 
graduate from a U.S. college or university, but 
the first African American to serve in a state 
legislature. In recognition of his contributions 
and his legacy as a trailblazer, the Vermont 
legislature passed a resolution in June 2020 
marking his birthday, September 23, 2020, as 
Alexander Twilight Day. 
Alexander was born on September 23, 1795 
to mixed-race parents. His father, Ichabod 
Twilight, fought with the Second New Hamp-
shire Regiment in the Revolutionary War. After 
the war, Ichabod and his wife, Mary, moved to 
Bradford, Vermont. 
Vermont’s 1777 constitution prohibited adult 
slavery, but the letter of the law was not re-
flected in practice. In the decades following 
Vermont’s acceptance as the 14th state, Black 
children were still held as slaves and all Black 
Vermonters continued to face the threat of 
being kidnapped and sold out of state. Against 
this backdrop of widespread discrimination, 
Twilight graduated with a bachelor’s degree 
from Middlebury College in 1823. He is the 
first known African American to receive a 
bachelor’s degree from any U.S. college or 
university. 
After he graduated, Twilight became a 
teacher and a minister. He moved to New 
York to teach and married Mercy Ladd Merrill. 
Soon after, he returned to Vermont to run the 
Orleans 
County 
Grammar 
School 
in 
Brownington. To accommodate increasing en-
rollment, he organized the funding and con-
struction of a new school building to house 
and educate students. He also served as the 
local pastor, delivering sermons decrying slav-
ery and supporting temperance. His sermons 
reveal a man of strong convictions, who 
viewed human history as a progression to-
wards greater individual freedom guided by 
conscience. 
In 1836, Twilight became ‘‘the first’’ again, 
this time as the first African American elected 
to serve in a state legislature. He continued to 
teach at the Orleans County School and in 
Quebec until 1855, when a stroke left him par-
alyzed. He died two years later, on June 19, 
1857. The next year, Vermont passed a com-
plete ban on slavery, declaring that anyone 
who entered the state was free. 
Today, Twilight’s house, the school where 
he taught, and the dormitory he built still stand 
as part of the Old Stone House Museum in 
the Brownington Historic District. His legacy as 
an educator lives on through the Museum, 
where his ideals are reflected in the museum’s 
educational programs, community services 
and his personal collection. Twilight’s memory 
is etched in Vermont’s higher learning institu-
tions, such as Middlebury College’s Alexander 
Twilight Hall and Alexander Twilight Audito-
rium at Northern Vermont University—Lyndon. 
I hope that Alexander Twilight will continue 
to be remembered and celebrated as a pio-
neer who persevered against long odds. He 
should also serve as a reminder of how far we 
have come as a nation, and how far we still 
have to go to achieve equality for all Ameri-
cans, regardless of skin color, race or eth-
nicity.

resident of Emery County, Ray understands 
well the challenges facing rural communities 
and the profound impact that federal, state, 
and local policy decisions have on the liveli-
hoods of so many. In his role as Emery Coun-
ty Public Lands Administrator, Ray was con-
sequential in assisting policymakers—from the 
county commission to the federal govern-
ment—reconcile differences and find solutions 
for the county’s land management, whose ex-
pansive plans fall heavily under state and fed-
eral domain. 
Sustained opportunity and access to Emery 
County’s lands are paramount for its economic 
vitality, particularly to its agriculture, recreation 
and tourism industries, and its local mining, 
gas and oil development. Ray has helped 
these key local industries navigate the chal-
lenges and opportunities of land management 
issues, to find compromise and success. 
A fitting final accomplishment to his career, 
Ray was instrumental in helping Utah’s con-
gressional delegation secure a victory for 
Emery County and the state’s public lands as 
the Emery County Public Lands Management 
Act was signed into law. This legislation 
marked the culmination of years of collabora-
tion and cooperation with local partners and 
officials, ensuring ongoing uses will be en-
joyed in Emery County without fear of a poten-
tial national monument designation from D.C., 
and consolidation of Utah trust lands that will 
generate millions in revenue for our school 
kids. It also included long-sought local land 
transfers to meet city government needs while 
expanding Goblin Valley State Park, a truly 
unique place that will now be better managed 
for future generations. 
Ray Petersen has championed rural lands 
issues of extraordinary significance to Utah 
throughout his esteemed career. Our great 
state owes him a debt of gratitude for three 
decades of selfless public service. I thank 
Ray.

CONGRATULATING MS. ELIZABETH 
CARR 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ms. Elizabeth Carr for receiving the 
2020 Outstanding Teaching of the Humanities 
Award presented by Humanities Texas. 
Humanities Texas presents annual state-
wide awards to encourage excellence in 
teaching and recognize Texas teachers who 
have made exemplary contributions in teach-
ing, 
curriculum 
development 
and 
extra-
curricular programming. Ms. Carr was one of 
16 teachers selected to be recognized, com-
peting against an application pool of over 700 
educators. Along with this prestigious award, 
Ms. Carr will also receive a $5,000 prize and 
a supplementary sum of $1,000 designated to 
help her school further humanity-based edu-
cation. 
Ms. Carr has been a teacher for almost fif-
teen years, and currently teaches U.S. History 
and World Geography at South Texas ISD 
Medical Professions High School. Her work to 
promote high-quality and equitable education 
to students in my district is admirable and crit-
ical in ensuring our students are well-prepared 
once they complete high school. 
Madam Speaker, I send my sincerest con-
gratulations to Ms. Elizabeth Carr for earning 
the highly prestigious Outstanding Teaching of 
the Humanities Award. Her dedication to her 
students and passion for the humanities is 
commendable, and her contributions to South 
Texas students and the school district will re-
verberate for years to come.

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SUR-
FACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support for H.R. 2, the Moving Forward 
Act. 
I want to thank Chairman DEFAZIO, Chair-
woman NORTON and Chairman LIPINSKI for 
their tremendous work on the Surface Trans-
portation portions of this bill. I would also like 
to thank the leadership for including water pro-
visions from my Water Resources and Envi-
ronment Subcommittee, and thank Chairman 
GRIJALVA for including my water recycling bill 
from the Natural Resources Committee in this 
package. 
Mr. Speaker, the surface transportation sec-
tion of this bill will make a significant impact in 
improving American lives by reducing com-
mute times, increasing safety on our high-
ways, bridges, buses and rails, and improving 
our environment. 
As the senior Californian on the Committee, 
I am proud that this bill will provide $37.5 bil-
lion in transportation funding for California, in-
cluding $26.5 billion for Highway projects and 
$11 billion for Transit. 
H.R. 2 includes important provisions I have 
worked on to improve transportation in the 
San Gabriel Valley, California, and our nation. 
These provisions are: 
A new Transit Worker Protection Program 
providing $60 million per year for transit agen-
cies to work with transit unions to identify and 
implement transit worker safety measures 
such as bus driver barriers and blind spot re-
movals. This will improve security and safety 
for all passengers, the bus drivers, and pedes-
trians. This program is based on my bill H.R. 
1139, the Transit Worker Protection Act. 
The bill includes a provision to allow local 
transportation agencies and cities to give pref-
erence to our local residents when hiring 
workers 
for 
transportation 
projects. 
With 
Southern California raising incredible funds for 
local transportation projects, taxpayers in our 
region should be given preference to work on 
the local projects they are paying for. This will 
allow that. 
$2.5 billion for a new highway rail under-
pass construction program (known as a grade 
separation grant program). This was created 
after we had the San Gabriel Valley Council of 
Governments testify earlier this year regarding 
the importance of highway rail safety and the 
very successful Alameda Corridor East under-
pass construction program in my region. This 
will create important safety and commuter 
benefits by separating the rail line from the 
roadway. 
$1.725 billion for electric bus purchases. 
This is important to Foothill Transit and LA 
METRO in my district who are rapidly pur-
chasing electric buses for their fleet. It also 
helps these transit agencies with funding the 
electric charging infrastructure and the mainte-
nance of these new-age buses. This will also 
support the workers in the electric bus industry 
including my constituents who work at Proterra 
bus company in Industry, CA. We must con-
tinue to improve the air quality of our region 
with clean bus implementation. 
$7 billion for bicycle, pedestrian, and safe 
routes to school projects. Many of the resi-
dents and cities in the San Gabriel Valley use 
this funding to improve bike trails and walk-
ways that allow students and workers to safely 
get to school, work, and the Metro station or 
bus stop. 
The bill updates competitive grant funding 
requirements for transportation grants so that 
projects in the San Gabriel Valley have a bet-
ter chance of being selected based on the 
merit of their applications. Southern California 
transportation projects such as the 57/60 con-
fluence project and the Alameda Corridor East 
Highway 
Rail 
grade 
crossing 
separation 
projects are the highest ranked projects in the 
country but consistently get overlooked be-
cause of politics. This bill makes the grant re-
quirements more associated with project qual-
ity and less by politics. 
The bill allows states to use federal trans-
portation funds to build suicide barriers on 
bridges. Studies show that the vast majority of 
suicides on bridges are because of a sudden 
impulse, and if a barrier were erected the per-
son would not continue with a suicide attempt. 
This is based on my bill with Rep. BEYER of 
Virginia called the Barriers to Suicide Act 
(H.R. 4309). 
The bill includes a provision that would re-
quire the Department of Transportation when 
working with local agencies on transit oriented 
development projects to address homeless 
housing assistance. The expansion of the 
Gold Line in my district has created important 
housing opportunities for residents that could 
be used to also address the homeless crisis 
we are facing in the San Gabriel Valley. 
The bill creates a Truck Driver Leasing Task 
Force that is based on a bill I introduced last 
Congress, H.R. 4144, the Port Truck Driver 
Bill of Rights. This will focus federal regulators 
and policy experts on creating solutions to 
controversial leasing arrangements in the 
trucking industry that are especially found at 
the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
These illegal tactics by some trucking compa-
nies underpay truck drivers by forcing them 
into leasing arrangements that require them to 
work long hours without abiding by minimum 
wage laws, let alone reasonable pay and ben-
efits. This task force will address these unfair 
practices against workers. 
The bill allows electric vehicle charging sta-
tions at park-and-ride lots and rest areas lo-
cated along the highway. Federal law currently 
prohibits electric vehicle charging stations at 
these locations and my provision will fix that. 
This is a huge problem at 20 park-and-ride 
lots in Los Angeles County including the El 
Monte Bus Station in my district, which is the 
largest bus transit station on the West coast. 
Electric vehicles owners should be allowed to 
drive to the metro station and charge their car 
while taking transit. 
The bill stops the Trump Administration from 
threatening to withhold $250 million annually

E605 
July 1, 2020 
in FAA grants to California airports and divert 
$70 million in CA State and Local general 
sales taxes away from their intended purpose. 
This provision was included in my amendment 
on the House floor that is the same as my bill 
H.R. 2939, the State and Local General Sales 
Tax Protection Act. This restores 29 years of 
FAA policy that the restriction on aviation fuel 
sales taxes for aviation purposes is based on 
excise taxes and not general sales taxes. This 
will allow the State of California, California 
Counties and California cities to continue to 
spend their general sales tax revenues on 
their voter approved purpose. 
An additional amendment of mine was 
adopted on the floor to protect the Transpor-
tation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation 
Act (TIFIA) loan program from being raided by 
other programs. TIFIA is incredibly important 
to Southern California as we are able to use 
this low cost financing with our Measure R, 
Measure M, and SB1 money to speed up 
transportation projects so they are completed 
now instead of 30 years from now. This 
means Southern California residents, busi-
nesses, and commuters get the benefits of 
these highway, transit and rail improvements 
today instead of waiting for future funding cy-
cles. This also saves money in the long run by 
shortening the time value of the costs of con-
struction. 
H.R. 2 also includes important provisions 
from the Water Resources and Environment 
Subcommittee which I chair that would provide 
federal assistance to clean water projects, 
water supply projects, and environmental im-
provements and recreation. These include: 
Reauthorizes the Clean Water State Revolv-
ing Fund at $40 billion over five years to con-
struct water treatment systems that address 
today’s water challenges to clean up our riv-
ers, streams, lakes and ocean for improved 
drinking water, recreation, and the environ-
ment. 
Authorizes $5.6 billion for clean water act 
grant programs (including $1 billion for treat-
ment of PFAS chemicals and other emerging 
contaminants) that can provide direct assist-
ance to local water agencies. 
Authorizes $3.4 billion to reauthorize various 
regional water programs over the next five 
years that the subcommittee recently passed, 
which include: the National Estuary Program, 
the San Francisco Bay Program, the Puget 
Sound Program, the Great Lakes Program, 
the Chesapeake Bay Program, and the Lake 
Pontchartrain Program. 
Appropriates $10 billion to the Army Corps 
of Engineers for construction projects for flood 
control, navigation, and environmental restora-
tion. This funding could be used to perform 
the Whittier Narrows Dam renovation project 
that will protect Southern California from major 
flooding events. 
Appropriates $5 billion for operation and 
maintenance of Army Corps projects which 
can be used on the Los Angeles, San Gabriel 
and Rio Hondo rivers to improve the river 
landscape and maintain proper flood control. 
The Natural Resources Committee has in-
cluded in H.R. 2 my bill, H.R. 1162, the Water 
Recycling Investment and Improvement Act. 
This will increase the authorization for the Bu-
reau of Reclamation’s Title XVI program, 
which is the most successful and primary 
water recycling program of the federal govern-
ment, from $50 million to $500 million. 
Title XVI provides cost-shared funding for 
water recycling projects that reclaim and reuse 
municipal, industrial, domestic or agricultural 
wastewater, and, naturally impaired ground or 
surface waters across the 17 Western states. 
This grant program has proven to be the most 
cost-effective in improving water supply by 
providing long-term savings, while boosting job 
growth and lowering our reliance on imported 
potable water. 
By increasing Title XVI’s authorization from 
$50 million to $500 million, it gives local water 
agencies the necessary funding to increase 
capacities for existing recycling plants or cre-
ate new cost-effective projects to boost water 
supplies. 
Since 1992, Congress has authorized 53 
Title XVI recycling projects, producing more 
than 400,000 acre-feet of drought-resistant 
water supply. Unfortunately, due to the lack of 
funding, there is a backlog of almost $1 billion 
dollars for congressionally authorized Title XVI 
projects—demonstrating a clear need to con-
tinue and expand funding. 
Not only do these projects create jobs and 
boost our local economies, farms, and busi-
nesses, but Title XVI projects can be brought 
on-line with ‘‘wet’’ water, not paper water, in 
as little as two years. These projects provide 
long-term savings, which is why water districts 
and sanitation agencies are overwhelmingly 
supportive of this program. 
With almost 50 percent of the country in 
drought and demands for clean water increas-
ing especially during this pandemic, Congress 
must look towards programs that further 
drought proof our drinking water, irrigation, 
and recreation water supplies. As we work to 
explore new ways to expand our water port-
folio and safeguard our local communities 
from future shortages and drought, it is imper-
ative that Congress adequately fund, promote 
and expand water recycling infrastructure 
projects. 
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to 
thank the cities, transportation agencies and 
water agencies in my district and state that 
were integral at informing the Congress of 
their concerns and ideas for infrastructure pol-
icy. 
I would particularly like to thank Mark 
Christoffels for testifying before the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee regarding 
railroad safety issues, and his colleague Paul 
Hubler who is also Chair of the Coalition for 
America’s Gateways and Trade Corridors. 
I would like to thank my local transit leaders 
for giving expert advice on transit issues and 
the improvements to transit we were able to 
make in this bill. This includes Phil Wash-
ington, Raffi Hamparian and Michael Davies 
from Los Angeles Metro, and Doran Barnes 
and David Reyno from Foothill Transit. 
And I would like to thank the San Gabriel 
Valley Council of Governments and our local 
city leaders who advocated for increased 
urban mobility with first and last mile solutions 
such as pedestrian walkways, bike paths, and 
improved bus and rail service. They also en-
couraged us to do more on transit-oriented de-
velopment and address homelessness which 
we were able to accomplish in this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope members appreciate 
the amazing work done by our Committee 
Chairs and Committee staff on this important 
infrastructure bill. They have spent countless 
hours, long weekends and many late nights 
putting this bill together through the odd work-
ing conditions of a pandemic. I would particu-
larly like to thank my incredible water sub-
committee 
staff 
Alexa 
Williams, 
Camille 
Touton, Navis Bermudez, and Ryan Seiger. I 
would also like to thank the staff who worked 
with me on provisions important to California 
including Helena Zyblikewycz, Garrett Gee, 
Jackie Schmitz, Auke Mahar-Piersma, Andrea 
Wohleber, and Matthew Muirragui.

IN CELEBRATION OF PASTOR 
JERRY HATTER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Pastor Jerry Hatter as he celebrates his retire-
ment from the pastoral ministry at Brown 
Chapel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) 
Church. 
After a 23–year career at Ford Motor Com-
pany in finance and accounting, Pastor Jerry 
Hatter entered into the Christian ministry full 
time. In August 1991, Pastor Hatter was ap-
pointed to serve as the 43rd pastor of Brown 
Chapel AME Church by Bishop Haskell Mayo. 
In the years since, Pastor Hatter has led to 
the church to unimaginable new heights and 
has nurtured, supported, and welcomed the 
entire Ypsilanti religious community in his min-
istry. Under his spiritual leadership, Brown 
Chapel created the Daniel Payne Scholarship 
Fund, began a Child Care Ministry, estab-
lished Brown Chapel Foundation, Inc., and 
partially sponsored a Habitat House, to name 
a few of the church’s numerous accomplish-
ments. Throughout the years, Pastor Hatter 
has also led Brown Chapel through some of 
its 
most 
incredible 
milestones, 
like 
the 
church’s 150th and 175th anniversaries, and 
the completion of the new church edifice in 
1999. 
Pastor Hatter uses his faith to support his 
local community. In the early 1990s, Pastor 
Hatter and Brown Chapel became one of 
Food Gatherer’s first partners. Determined to 
battle hunger in Michigan, Pastor Hatter pro-
moted thoughtful collaboration among his con-
gregation to determine ways to address the 
root causes of food insecurity. Since, Pastor 
Hatter has been active in a variety of other 
outreach programs that uplift the underprivi-
leged and give them the resources they need 
to lead healthy, fulfilling, and dignified lives. 
His passion for service even took him to India, 
where he embarked on a mission trip in 2013. 
To date, Pastor Hatter has held membership

honored by the organization for his tremen-
dous accomplishments in the community. 
Among his friends, family, peers, and con-
gregation, Pastor Jerry Hatter is recognized as 
a dedicated and spirited leader who humbly 
strives to make the world a better place. As 
the longest-serving pastor in Brown Chapel 
AME Church’s history, Pastor Hatter has 
preached at a variety of prestigious celebra-
tions across Michigan and implemented a 
number of successful faith-based programs. In 
times of divisiveness and strife, Pastor Hatter 
is been the voice of reason, and he has been 
an unwavering advocate of the entire religious 
community. Without a doubt, Pastor Hatter 
has demonstrated what a true servant of God 
should endeavor to be. He provides a clear 
example of selfless love and compassion that 
encourages others to life a life of purpose, in-
tegrity, and virtue. His commitment to the word 
of God has left a positive mark on Brown 
Chapel and the community beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the retirement of Pastor 
Jerry Hatter from the pastoral ministry at 
Brown Chapel AME Church. In addition to 
being a faithful leader, Pastor Hatter was a 
friend who was deeply valued, cherished, and 
respected by John Dingell. His devotion to 
God continues to make a difference, and his 
legacy at Brown Chapel AME Church is one 
that will never be forgotten. Although we are 
sad to see him go, we are all grateful for his 
years of service, his extraordinary work, and 
his significant community impact.

HONORING COLONEL GREG FORD 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Colonel Greg Ford for his 24 
years of military service and to congratulate 
him on the occasion of his retirement from the 
United States Army. Colonel Ford assumed 
command of Presidio of Monterey (POM) in 
June 2018 and has served not only the post, 
but also the broader community with distinc-
tion. It has been a privilege to work alongside 
Colonel Ford over the past two years, and it 
is my honor to recognize his service on the 
House floor today. 
Colonel Ford earned a bachelor’s degree 
from Western Oregon University in 1996, and 
was commissioned a Military Intelligence Sec-
ond Lieutenant through ROTC. He later held 
numerous assignments within the 101st Air-
borne, deploying to Operation Iraqi Freedom 
multiple times between 2001 and 2006. In 
2010, Ford transferred to Hawaii where he 
served as the U.S. Army Pacific G2 Oper-
ations Chief and later as the 25th Infantry Divi-
sion G2. Between these assignments, Ford 
deployed to Afghanistan from 2014 to 2015. 
Upon his return, Ford became a U.S. Army 
War College Fellow at the Daniel K. Inouye 
Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. From 
there, he served in the Republic of Korea as 
the G2 Chief of Operations for the 8th U.S. 
Army. 
In the two years that Colonel Ford served 
as Garrison Commander at the Presidio of 
Monterey, he has made a lasting impact on 
base operations, military families, and the 
wellbeing of the broader community. He was a 
leading advocate for Presidio of Monterey 
Housing residents and worked tirelessly to en-
sure 
safe 
and 
quality 
housing 
to 
our 
servicemembers and their families. My office 
has received countless testimonials from POM 
residents who credit Colonel Ford with improv-
ing their health and safety through his advo-
cacy efforts and direct communication with 
anyone in need of assistance. 
Colonel Ford continuously engaged on the 
Fort Ord Reuse Authority Board to ensure 
Army equities and community reuse goals 
were 
synchronized. 
He 
also 
worked 
to 
strengthen ties between POM and the local 
community, including organizing rehearsals of 
the Peninsula Evacuation Plan with the City of 
Monterey for the first time in a decade. 
During his command, Colonel Ford worked 
with local organizations and leaders to im-
prove support to Gold Star Families, Excep-
tional Family Members, and Housing Resi-
dents. In doing so, he sought ways to inte-
grate local efforts, such as Stonepine Estate, 
Operation Care and Comfort, and Hayward 
Scores, to better support the military commu-
nity. 
Most recently, Colonel Ford rose to the 
challenge as COVID–19 reached the central 
coast of California. He coordinated with the 
County and local municipalities to ensure that 
Garrison actions were synchronized with local 
efforts. Additionally, Colonel Ford quickly im-
plemented safety measures through POM and 
held regular virtual townhalls to ensure the 
Military community remained informed in the 
midst 
of 
the 
pandemic. 
His 
actions 
undoubtably contributed to the relatively small 
impact of COVID–19 within POM. 
It has been a pleasure having Colonel Ford 
and his wife, Mrs. Rebecca Ford, in Monterey 
for the past two years. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in congratulating Colonel Ford 
on his retirement and expressing gratitude for 
his and his family’s many years of honorable 
service to our country.

COMMEMORATING JAMES 
‘‘RUSTY’’ MITCHELL 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the retirement of James 
‘‘Rusty’’ Mitchell from the Department of the 
Air Force as a civilian employee out of Luke 
Air Force Base, Arizona. 
Mr. Mitchell has been a well-loved and influ-
ential member of the military and veteran com-
munity for over 25 years. He began his career 
in the Air Force flying fighter jets and retired 
from Active Duty after 22 years as the Com-
mander of the 21st Fighter Squadron at Luke 
Air Force Base. 
During his time in service, Mr. Mitchell ac-
quired a long list of achievements and awards 
to include the Defense Meritorious Service 
Medal, Air Force Aerial Achievement Medal, 
both the Air Force and Army Commendation 
Medals, and more. Professionally, he has 
been awarded the Air Force Practice Award 
and the Valley Peaks Community Partnership 
Award, to name a few. He also serves on the 
Board of Directors for Valley Partnership and 
WESTMARC. 
Mr. Mitchell has dedicated the last 17 years 
to serving the West Valley proactively—pro-
moting the relationships between Luke Air 
Force Base, nine municipalities, Maricopa 
County, and the State of Arizona as the Direc-
tor of the Community Initiatives Team with 
Luke Air Force Base. The relationships he 
built on behalf of Luke Air Force Base con-
tinue to be critical to accomplishing their mis-
sion of ‘‘Training the World’s Best Fighter Pi-
lots.’’ 
I am certain that his efforts improving rela-
tionships with communities near bases that 
are tasked with flight operation missions has 
enhanced the compatibility of several military 
bases and their communities across the 
United States. 
On this day, we as a community would like 
to thank Mr. Mitchell for his service to his 
country. His impact will be felt not only in the 
West Valley, but also within the Air Force 
Community beyond his retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN 
ROUSH’S RETIREMENT 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Dr. John A. Roush on his re-
tirement as president of Centre College in 
Danville, Kentucky. 
President Roush often told his students, ‘‘Do 
your best. Be your best. No regrets.’’ I have 
had the privilege of getting to know President 
Roush during my time representing Danville 
and Centre College in Congress, and I can 
undoubtedly say that President Roush always 
did his best. I have always admired his work 
and appreciated his advice, particularly when 
I served as chairman of the Higher Education 
subcommittee. During his 22 years at Centre 
College, he oversaw a 40 percent growth in 
the student body population, without sacrificing 
quality of education or Centre’s liberal arts val-
ues. He has helped build Centre’s national 
reputation. My colleagues might know Centre 
as the host of not one, but two vice presi-
dential debates during his time as president. 
President Roush’s legacy will live on at Centre 
College for generations to come. 
Today is not only the first day of President 
Roush’s retirement, but also his birthday. I 
congratulate him on his retirement, and I wish 
him and his wife Susie the best.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
WILLIAM S. ‘‘BUD’’ LEONARD 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of William S. ‘‘Bud’’ Leonard. 
Mr. Leonard left this earth on Monday, June 
29, 2020 at the age of 90 years. Mr. Leonard 
was born in Kingsville, Texas on July 9, 1929, 
the second child of William and Effie Leonard. 
His father was an Irish railroad man and his 
mother a first-generation U.S.-born child of 
Italian immigrants. 
In junior high, Bud met his first love—foot-
ball, a love affair that would eventually take 
him through college at Lamar University. It 
was at Lamar where Mr. Leonard won the 
heart of the love of his life, his wife Charlene 
Matthews Leonard whom he married in 1953, 
embarking on 66-and-a half years of a blessed 
life together. Shortly after marriage, Mr. Leon-
ard joined the United States Navy where he 
trained to become an airplane pilot and rose 
to the rank of Lieutenant. Mr. Leonard earned 
his Wings of Gold in 1955 and served tours 
that took him from California to Hawaii, Guam, 
Japan, and the Philippines before being re-
leased from active duty in 1957. 
Following Mr. Leonard’s active duty, he and 
his wife returned to Texas in 1958 and settled 
in Beaumont. 
Mr. Leonard began a successful career in 
advertising and remained close to Lamar Uni-
versity where he was instrumental in forming 
the Cardinal Club, Ex Letterman’s Association 
and the Cardinal Hall of Honor. In 1974, he 
was called by Dr. John E. Gray to join the Ad-
ministration at the University where he re-
mained until his first retirement in 1994 as 
Vice Chancellor of Development. Following his 
retirement, he returned for one year to teach 
at Lamar and then started his own consulting/ 
advertising company which he did until he re-
tired for a second time at age 87. 
Lamar honored Mr. Leonard’s contribution to 
the University on and off the field by naming 
the stadium playing field the W.S. ‘‘Bud’’ Leon-
ard field in his honor. In addition to many 
other honors he was also named Distin-
guished Alumnus in 2000. 
Closely intertwined with his community, Mr. 
Leonard served in the Art Museum of South-
east Texas, Neches River Festival and the 
Greater Beaumont Chamber of Commerce. He 
and his wife were active members of their be-
loved Calder Baptist Church for over 60 years 
where he served as Deacon and a Sunday 
school teacher. 
He is survived by his loving wife Charlene, 
daughter Joni, son Will and his twin grand-
daughters, Anne and Claire who were the ap-
ples of his eye. 
A wordsmith and artist with a servant’s 
heart, Mr. Leonard made the world a better 
place. 
CELEBRATING 
PRINCE 
WILLIAM 
COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT’S 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Prince William County Po-
lice 
Department’s 
50th 
Anniversary. 
The 
Prince William County Police Department is a 
vital part of the safety and community of the 
First District of Virginia, and it is an honor to 
serve as their U.S. Congressman. 
In March 1970, the Prince William County 
Board of Supervisors unanimously passed 
Resolution 11 to establish a Police Depart-
ment for Prince William County. On July 1st, 
1970, a group of 42 individuals met at the Old 
Bennett School in Manassas as the first mem-
bers of the Prince William County Police De-
partment. They started small with limited re-
sources, and have grown into a leading orga-
nization within Prince William County and Vir-
ginia. 
The mission statement of the Prince William 
County Police Department is to enhance the 
quality of life by providing police services 
through shared responsibility with the public. 
The Prince William County Police Department 
is committed to protecting constitutional guar-
antees and impartially enforcing the law. The 
department does so through integrity, trust, 
and honesty, all of which they believe are es-
sential to providing exceptional police serv-
ices. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in celebrating Prince William 
County’s Police Department’s 50th Anniver-
sary. I have full confidence that the depart-
ment will continue to be an integral part of the 
wonderful Prince William County community 
as well as the First District of Virginia.

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND

TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, a trans-
formative investment of $1.5 trillion to create 
jobs, protect our climate, and modernize our 
highways, 
hospitals, 
schools, 
broadband 
connectivity, housing, clean water, and energy 
infrastructure. 
The American Society of Civil Engineers 
evaluated the state of the nation’s infrastruc-
ture in 2017 and gave the U.S. a D+ grade. 
They estimated that we need to invest $2 tril-
lion more than we are today to bring our infra-
structure to a good state of repair. While this 
is a significant amount, failing to act will lead 
to an estimated $4 trillion in lower economic 
output, including the loss of 2.5 million jobs. 
With the economy still reeling from the 
COVID–19 pandemic, this legislation takes on 
an even greater urgency. 
The Moving Forward Act is not only big, it 
is green. Climate policy is a cornerstone of the 
bill because the transportation sector contrib-
utes nearly one-third of our country’s green-
house gas emissions. The legislation invests 
$100 billion to make our public transit faster, 
cleaner, and more reliable, taking cars off the 
road and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
These investments include significant funding 
for electric buses which will help transit pro-
viders such as SamTrans, VTA, and Santa 
Cruz METRO transition their bus fleets to all 
zero-emission vehicles by 2040. The bill also 
provides $1.4 billion to deploy electric vehicle 
charging stations across the country, $8.3 bil-
lion for state carbon reduction grants, and $70 
billion to modernize the electric grid to support 
additional renewable energy, improve energy 
efficiency, and support an expansive electric 
vehicle charging network. Together these in-
vestments make the Moving Forward Act one 
of the most significant bills to address climate 
change ever considered in Congress. 
In addition to emission reductions in the 
transportation and power sectors, the Moving 
Forward Act also includes significant funding 
for environmental restoration, including $125 
million for the San Francisco Bay. These 
funds will support ongoing work to restore 
habitats for endangered species and protect 
cities like Mountain View, Palo Alto, and Red-
wood City from sea level rise. The bill also 
provides funding to reclaim abandoned coal 
mines, increase drought resilience, and clean 
up drinking water contaminated by per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 
I’m pleased that the Moving Forward Act 
provides $3.6 billion in guaranteed transit 
funding for the Bay Area, a 50 percent in-
crease from the last highway bill in 2015. It 
also adjusts the criteria for several discre-
tionary grants that will make Bay Area transit 
projects more likely to receive additional fed-
eral funding. The dedicated $2.5 billion for 
grade separations nationwide will benefit both 
Caltrain riders and communities along the 
Caltrain corridor which has 42 at-grade cross-
ings, including the crossing at the top of the 
California Public Utility Commission’s priority 
list. This funding will be a welcome relief to my 
constituents who are choking in traffic, with 
commute times in the Bay Area prior to the 
pandemic nearly twice as long as they were 
ten years ago. 
The Moving Forward Act also provides $100 
billion to ensure every American has internet 
connectivity. Tens of millions of Americans 
across the U.S. still lack basic access to high- 
quality broadband internet service. Access to 
high speed internet service is essential in the 
21st Century, particularly as Americans are 
conducting more of their lives online during 
the COVID–19 public health emergency. I’m 
pleased that two of my broadband bills are in-
cluded in this legislation. My bipartisan Nation-
wide Dig Once Act of 2020 is commonsense 
legislation that requires the inclusion of con-
duit—plastic pipes that house fiber optic ca-
bles—during federally funded highway con-
struction. My Community Broadband Act pro-
tects municipal broadband networks from state 
laws that thwart the efforts of communities es-
tablishing their own networks. 
The Moving Forward Act provides $10 bil-
lion for hospitals and community health cen-
ters to make critical capital improvements and 
rebuild their infrastructure to meet the growing 
demands on these health care facilities, espe-
cially during the COVID–19 pandemic. Impor-
tantly, the bill also creates a pilot program to

fund upgrades to state and local public labora-
tories, which are essential to our nation’s test-
ing capacity as we work to control and re-

The infrastructure investments in the Moving 
Forward Act create good-paying jobs that can-
not be outsourced, promote economic growth, 
reduce our greenhouse emissions, and ex-
pand broadband to communities across the 
country. I’m proud to support this legislation 
and urge my colleagues to join me in voting 
for it.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the Columbia Business Report of 
June 22 reported another success of the Uni-
versity of South Carolina with the leadership of 
President Bob Caslen. 
U.S.C. IS AMONG THE TOP 100 WORLDWIDE FOR 
PATENTS RECEIVED BY FACULTY 
The University of South Carolina ranked 
among the top 100 universities worldwide for 
number of U.S. utility patents received by 
faculty members in 2019, marking the eighth 
consecutive year the university made the top 
100. 
USC ranked 90th in the world in 2019 with 
faculty named as the lead on 31 patents, ac-
cording to a news release from the univer-
sity. 
The annual list (.pdf) has been published by 
the National Academy of Inventors and the 
Intellectual Property Owners Association 
since 2013. Rankings are based on the number 
of utility patents granted by the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office that list a university 
as the first assignee. 
‘‘Our faculty’s ability to create new tech-
nologies and innovate year after year is one 
of our great strengths as a university,’’ said 
Bill Kirkland, executive director of USC’s 
Office for Innovation, Partnership and Eco-
nomic Engagement. ‘‘Their continued con-
tributions to scientific discovery ultimately 
improve the quality of life not just our state, 
but all over the world.’’

HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Francky Pierre-Paul, a 
local hero from Florida’s 21st Congressional 
District that has gone above and beyond as a 
tireless advocate for the homeless community 
in Palm Beach County. 
Francky has become a familiar and friendly 
face to those in our community experiencing 
homelessness. Before COVID–19, Francky 
would go to John Prince Park once a month 
with a mobile shower, hold clothing and food 
drives, and offer haircuts to the people who 
live there. He would also frequently go to 
Palm Beach County Commission meetings 
and speak on behalf of the John Prince Park 
homeless community. Since the pandemic 
started, however, Francky has only become 
more generous with his time. In fact, he has 
now started going to John Prince Park two-to- 
three times every day to distribute food and 
resources to those in need. 
Francky’s selflessness and compassion dur-
ing this difficult time is truly humbling. His out-
standing work has touched countless lives, 
and I am so thankful for his dedication to our 
community. I am proud to honor him today.

HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY 
LIFE OF MR. BOBBY J. MORROW 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to the extraordinary life of Mr. Bobby J. 
Morrow and recognize his achievements as a 
three-time Olympic gold medalist. 
Mr. Morrow was a resident of San Benito, 
TX for much of his life. He attended San Be-
nito High School, where he excelled athlet-
ically in both track and football. Following 
graduation, Mr. Morrow was a sprinter for Abi-
lene Christian University, where he would go 
on to break and defend records on the na-
tional collegiate scale. 
At just 21 years old, Mr. Morrow travelled to 
Melbourne, Australia, for the 1956 Olympics to 
represent the United States of America. Mr. 
Morrow would win three gold medals in the 
100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and 4x100- 
meter relay—even going so far as to break the 
world record in the relay, and match it in the 
200-meter dash. His success on the collegiate 
and Olympic levels earned him the Sports 
Illustrated’s title of ‘‘Sportsman of the Year’’ in 
1956. He would also collect the Amateur Ath-
letic Union’s James E. Sullivan Award in 1957 
before being inducted into the National Track 
and Field Hall of Fame in 1975. 
Bobby Morrow was not only a talented ath-
lete, but also a kind and giving man. He do-
nated all of his Olympic medals in hopes of in-
spiring others to pursue their own dreams. Mr. 
Morrow is survived by his longtime, loving 
partner of 20 years, Judy Parker of Harlingen, 
TX, his five children, eleven grandchildren, 
and eight great-grandchildren. 
His rare talent and character are remem-
bered throughout San Benito and the 34th 
Congressional District of Texas. San Benito 
CISD has dedicated two athletic facilities to 
him as a tribute to his athletic excellence and 
to share his inspirational story. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating and remembering the 
life of Mr. Morrow.

SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN LEWIS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act. 
This vital legislation makes critical investments 
in our nation’s transportation, upgrades our 
drinking water and energy systems, and builds 
new hospitals, schools, and homes. 
My constituents in Metro Atlanta know all 
too well that we have fallen behind in building 
for the future. Every day, we waste time and 
gasoline in some of the worst traffic in Amer-
ica. We have uneven access across our re-
gion to transit and safe bicycle and pedestrian 
paths. Our schools and water systems strug-
gle to keep up with the demands of our time. 
We need something new. Our current sys-
tem puts good jobs out of reach, good homes 
out of grasp, and good air out of breath. For 
too long, our nation’s transportation system 
prioritized highway expansion and exclu-
sionary legacies that result in gentrification 
and displacement. These transportation plan-
ning policies contribute to racial and socio-
economic disparities in income, health, edu-
cation, and environment. We can and we must 
do better. 
The bill before us puts our country on the 
right track. H.R. 2 is a model that builds a 21st 
century transportation and infrastructure foun-
dation. It increases funding for transit expan-
sion, highway repair, and connectivity in low- 
income communities. It ensures that drivers, 
passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians can 
safely use roads. H.R. 2 also makes a down 
payment towards leaving a planet that is a lit-
tle cleaner and a little greener for our children. 
I am pleased that H.R. 2 also includes three 
amendments critical for my constituents in 
Metro Atlanta. The first amendment allows 
Federal funds to build noise barriers that pro-
tect older neighborhoods from highway noise. 
In my district, many communities predate the 
interstate system. Over time, these highways 
became wider, busier, and louder, and the 
trees that kept the sounds down have worn 
thin. Residents are sick and tired of the noise 
and want some peace and quiet. My no-cost 
amendment will improve quality of life in frus-
trated communities across America. 
The bill also includes my proposal about 
disputed changes in airport ownership. This 
amendment enacts current rules which main-
tain the Federal government’s neutrality on 
these sensitive local matters. This common- 
sense policy provides certainty for pas-
sengers, airlines, concessionaires, and airport 
employees. 
Finally, I am proud to co-sponsor an effort 
led by my friend, Ms. NAPOLITANO of Cali-
fornia. Our amendment overturns a Federal 
rule on sales taxes that uniquely affects Clay-
ton County in my district. It would recover $24 
million per year for the county, its cities, and 
the Clayton County Public Schools. 
When I first came to Congress, I joined 
what was then the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee to work on many of 
these issues, and I am proud to continue to

sons, I would like to thank Chairman PETER 
DEFAZIO and his staff for helping me secure 
these priorities in H.R. 2 will continue to work 
with my colleagues to enact these common- 
sense policies into law. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It reminds 
us that we do not have to endure exhausting 
commutes, leaky pipes, or outdated schools. It 
offers hope for a better, fairer, more vibrant fu-
ture for our families and communities. 
I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 
2 and urge the Senate to pass it without 
delay. The American people cannot afford to 
wait any longer for relief.

SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today thank Chairman NEAL and Chair-
man THOMPSON for their work on the GREEN 
Act, included in H.R. 2. 
As a longstanding proponent of utilizing the 
tax code to support green energy, I am thrilled 
that this legislation extends and expands tax 
incentives that have a proven track record of 
increasing deployment of these technologies. 
In particular, this legislation is a win for the 
fuel cell vehicle industry in Connecticut and 
nationwide. Light-duty fuel cell vehicles are 
electric vehicles that generate electricity on-
board through an electrochemical reaction of 
hydrogen, not combustion. These cars emit 
zero carbon, zero NOx, zero SOx, and zero 
particulate matter from the tailpipe, and are 
capable of traveling 300 to 400 miles on a 
tank of fuel, with refueling in just three to five 
minutes. This technology is one of the most 
promising avenues to reduce emissions in the 
medium and heavy-duty sector. 
The GREEN Act extends the expiring alter-
native fuel vehicle refueling property credit 
(30C), a necessary incentive to build-up a hy-
drogen refueling network to make widespread 
adoption possible. Additionally, the legislation 
modifies the credit to better support electric 
vehicle charger deployment. I look forward to 
working 
with 
Chairman 
NEAL, 
Chairman 
THOMPSON, and the Ways and Means Com-
mittee to similarly ensure that the 30C credit 
is optimized for fuel cell vehicle infrastructure 
and to continue broader efforts towards sup-
porting clean energy technology.

SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the ‘‘Moving Forward Act’’ (H.R. 
2), a $1.5 trillion plan to rebuild America’s in-
frastructure. The critical investments included 
in this bill are needed to repair our nation’s in-
frastructure and prepare for the future. 
Our nation has the ability to create a better, 
brighter and more prosperous future by invest-
ing much more in our nation’s infrastructure. 
H.R. 2 will create millions of well-paying jobs, 
increase sustained long-term growth, and 
make us more globally competitive, while at 
the same time protecting our environment and 
improving our health. By making significant in-
vestments in surface transportation, rail and 
transit systems, aviation, energy production 
and distribution, schools, broadband and 
housing, H.R. 2 will help us meet the de-
mands of a 21st-century economy. 
One of the areas I am particularly proud to 
see this bill address is the need to include 
high speed broadband internet in our overall 
national infrastructure. 
Electricity was the infrastructure that helped 
this country move forward last century and our 
leaders made a great investment to ensure 
every American who wanted to be connected 
to the electrical grid had the opportunity to do 
so. Broadband and gigabit internet access will 
play the same role in the 21st century. 
We see examples of the future today as we 
grapple with the COVID–19 pandemic. Stu-
dents are able to learn outside the classroom 
thanks to advances in distance learning, 
Americans are able to meet with their doctors 
through telemedicine services, and millions of 
Americans are able to keep their jobs and stay 
safe by working from home. 
Sadly, the luxury of having reliable high- 
speed internet access is not available to all 
Americans. Those who live in rural and poor 
communities are being left behind in this tech-
nical revolution, as they were in the previous 
century with electricity prior to the investments 
championed by President Roosevelt and fund-
ed by Congress. 
This bill makes the needed investment of 
$80 billion to ensure that every American 
household, business, school, and medical fa-
cility has access to high speed internet so that 
they can be a part of the technological revolu-
tion that will strengthen our economy as we 
recover from the COVID–19 pandemic. I am 
happy to see that this bill invests towards the 
future by dedicating a set amount of funding to 
provide gigabit internet access. While cities 
like Dallas are starting to get access to this 
ultrafast internet, we need to make sure that 
funding is available so that the groundwork 
can be laid to ensure every American eventu-
ally has access to this new technology. I ap-
plaud my colleague, Mr. CLYBURN for cham-
pioning this cause as we address the needs of 
the American people. I will also note that as 
Chair of the Science Committee, we voted out 
a broadband bill last year to address these se-
rious needs and I am happy that broadband 
provisions are moving in this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 also contains a number 
of high priority provisions from the bipartisan 
Surface Transportation Research and Devel-
opment Act that I introduced with Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee Ranking 
Member LUCAS. As Chair of the Science Com-
mittee, I want to thank Transportation & Infra-
structure Chairman DEFAZIO for working with 
me to incorporate these provisions in this bill. 
I will list just a few of them. They include the 
establishment of an advanced transportation 
research and innovation program for long- 
term, high risk research. Among its objectives, 
this program is intended to improve the resil-
ience of transportation infrastructure across di-
verse regions of the United States to natural 
disasters, extreme weather, and the effects of 
climate change. In addition, there is a provi-
sion that authorizes establishment of a Multi- 
modal Transportation Demonstration Program 
for the demonstration of advanced transpor-
tation technologies for local transportation or-
ganizations and transit agencies serving popu-
lations of 200,000 or less. 
H.R. 2 also contains a provision that re-
quires the Secretary of Transportation to enter 
into an agreement with the National Acad-
emies of Sciences to develop a long-term re-
search agenda for surface transportation that 
would address advanced technologies and in-
novation, including advancing connected and 
autonomous technologies. If this bill is en-
acted, these and the other Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee priorities that have 
been included will go a long way to ensuring 
that the nation will have a vital and robust 
transportation R&D capability. 
In addition, I am pleased to co-sponsor an 
amendment that we will be considering on the 
Floor to address the significant deferred main-
tenance needs of the Department of Energy’s 
national laboratories, some of which date back 
to the Manhattan Project, and to accelerate 
the modernization of these critical facilities. 
This is an important first step. However, the 
need and opportunity to bolster our nation’s 
research infrastructure across the country and 
throughout the federal government remains. I 
am going to continue to work to ensure that 
strong support for our national research enter-
prise is included in any future bills that aim to 
accelerate our economic recovery from the 
current global crisis. 
In addition to the inclusion of these research 
infrastructure provisions, I want to thank the 
Chairman for working with me to include a 
number of amendments that were included in 
the INVEST in America Act. 
One amendment provides support for train-
ing surface transportation workers who may

lose their jobs due to increased automation of 
services. 
It is clear that due to COVID–19 and other 
pandemics that may occur, there will be more 
‘‘contactless services’’ in the future and the 
transportation industry will indeed be im-
pacted. My concern is for the employees who 
are at risk and on the front lines, who lack the 
training needed to both service and operate 
our future transportation systems. The Moving 
Forward Act includes a $50 million Surface 
Transportation Workforce Training Grant Pro-
gram that will help our current workers get 
ready and prepare themselves for these auto-
mated vehicles (AV) that will use artificial intel-
ligence (AI) to operate and maintain our sur-
face transportation systems. 
It is encouraging to see that this bill con-
tains provisions that support the development 
of high speed rail and its financing options. 
We have much work to do in the immerging 
development of high speed rail in the United 
States. We have been left behind by other 
countries in this much needed era of trans-
porting people efficiently from one part of our 
nation to another. I am a strong supporter of 
the development of high-speed rail in the 
United States. 
It my state, Texas Central is working to de-
velop high-speed rail system connecting Dal-
las and Houston in less than 90 minutes and 
at speeds up to 205 mph. This high-speed 
train will provide a faster, safer and more envi-
ronmentally friendly mode of transportation 
that will serve two of the top five largest met-
ropolitan statistical areas in the United States, 
Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, as well as the 
greater College Station area, through the 
Brazos Valley station. 
One of the major issues that has arisen dur-
ing the development of this major infrastruc-
ture project is the access to large scale of 
Capital Financing required to ensure the suc-
cess of this project. While the project is esti-
mated to cost $32 billion, with the government 
of Japan expected to pay up to half the cost, 
financing a project at this scale is something 
that programs like the Railroad Rehabilitation 
and Improvement Funding (RRIF) program 
would have great difficulty in accomplishing 
due to the Credit Risk Premiums rules that 
would adversely impact the borrowers or such 
large scale projects. I am encouraged that my 
amendment to provide a workable option for 
Texas Central to meet the CRP was included 
in the bill. 
Another area of importance that I am happy 
to see included in this legislation is the im-
provement of Amtrak’s cybersecurity capabili-
ties. 
Millions of Americans use Amtrak each 
year, the incorporation of technology in the 
Amtrak system has allowed the company to 
grow while providing a safer and more cus-
tomer friendly experience for passengers. But 
technological advances continue, the risk of 
cybersecurity threats only rises. I am encour-
aged to see provisions included in this bill that 
allow Amtrak to procure the needed cyberse-
curity technology to combat attacks against 
the operation of its rail system. 
To address Amtrak’s cybersecurity needs, 
my amendment directs the Secretary to estab-
lish a cybersecurity enhancement grant pro-
gram, which will permit Amtrak to acquire ac-
tive cyber defense capabilities to implement 
cyber resiliency improvements for train control 
systems and other IT assets systemwide. 
In my time serving in this chamber, I’ve 
learned that no single piece of legislation is 
perfect. I hope to continue working with the 
chairman of the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture committee to address issues related to 
strengthening our nation’s freight rail network 
and in particular Union Pacific and a number 
of issue raised with this bill. 
I also want to say just a few words about 
the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise or 
DBE program. Over the almost 40 years since 
the DBE Program was first enacted, we have 
made progress—but not nearly enough. The 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture has collected enormous amounts of evi-
dence that illustrates just how stubborn and 
harmful institutionalized bias and systemic rac-
ism really are to people of color. The bottom 
line is that DBEs have to fight twice as hard 
and still usually end up getting far less money 
than goes to firms owned by non-minority 
males. 
Not only that, but discrimination means that 
even starting a business is harder for minority 
and women owned firms. The recent disparity 
study conducted for Texas DOT used Census 
data to examine this issue. The study found 
that the business formation rate for white 
males was 5.4 percent, but the rate for African 
Americans was less than a third of that—1.6 
percent. For Hispanic Americans it was 2 per-
cent, for Native Americans it was 2.9 percent, 
and for white women it was 3.1 percent. For 
Asian/Pacific Islanders it was better—5.2 per-
cent but still lower than for white males. Texas 
Department of Transportation Disparity Study 
2019, Colette Holt & Associates, 2019, at 133. 
The disparities for firm formation in construc-
tion in Texas were even worse. White men 
formed construction firms at a rate of 10.3 per-
cent, but for Asian/Pacific Islanders the rate 
was only 9.5 percent. For white women it was 
8.9 percent. Shockingly the construction firm 
formation rates for Native Americans, Hispanic 
Americans and African Americans were 4.9 
percent, 3.5 percent and 2.9 percent respec-
tively. Id. at 135. 
Think about what this means—as bad as 
the economic disparities are for firms owned 
by minorities and women, the current data ac-
tually understates the problem, since it doesn’t 
take into consideration all the firms that could 
never even get off the ground. How can mi-
norities and women ever erase the gaps in 
business inequality if discrimination keeps 
them from even forming the businesses they 
need to compete? This is exactly what makes 
the DBE program so important—while it 
doesn’t fully level the playing field, it provides 
a demand for businesses owned by minorities 
and women and gives those businesses that 
do exist at least a fighting chance to compete. 
Mr. Speaker, enactment of H.R. 2 will allow 
our nation to move forward with critical im-
provements to our nation’s roads, tunnels and 
bridges, our ports and harbors, airports, and 
rail systems. It will fund improvements in safe 
drinking water and wastewater systems, and 
create more affordable housing. The bill will 
help to modernize schools, invest in the postal 
service and provide high speed internet to un-
derserved areas. Most of these proposals are 
long overdue and we cannot wait any longer 
to move our country forward. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
STANLEY BALZEKAS, JR. 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 1, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate and commemorate the life of Mr. 
Stanley Balzekas Jr., who passed away on 
June 18 at the age of 95 . Stanley Balzekas 
was an American war hero, a tireless sup-
porter of Lithuania and Lithuanian culture, and 
a pillar of Chicago’s Southwest Side. 
Mr. Balzekas was an American patriot, hav-
ing proudly served in the United States Army 
during World War II. He landed in Normandy 
and bravely fought in the Battle of the Hurtgen 
Forest, one of the longest and fiercest battles 
in Europe. He was eventually captured by the 
Nazis and spent the rest of the war as a 
POW. For heroically risking his life to rescue 
twelve wounded soldiers, Mr. Balzekas was 
awarded the Bronze Star as well as the Purple 
Heart. 
Returning from the war, Stanley Balzekas 
earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees from 
DePaul University and then took the reins of 
his family’s car dealership, Balzekas Motor 
Sales, on Archer Avenue in Chicago. But Mr. 
Balzekas’ passion was preserving and spread-
ing Lithuanian history and culture. In 1966, 
Stanley Balzekas founded the Balzekas Mu-
seum of Lithuanian Culture in Chicago. 
Through his dedicated leadership, the mu-
seum grew to become the largest repository of 
Lithuanian cultural artifacts outside of Lith-
uania. Mr. Balzekas’s tireless work enhanced 
America’s understanding of Lithuanian history 
and enriched the culture of the Chicagoland 
community. 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr. 
Balzekas’s family. Mr. Balzekas was the hus-
band of the late Irene and is survived by his 
loving children Stanley III, Robert, Carol, and 
six grandchildren Irena, Stanley IV, Matthew, 
Margaret, Lucas, and Eva. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Stanley 
Balzekas, Jr. His contributions to our country, 
Lithuania and Lithuanian culture, and the 
Southwest Side of Chicago will not be forgot-
ten. He will be remembered as a great man.

SPEECH OF 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 30, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
express my support for H.R. 2, the Moving 
Forward Act. H.R. 2 has significant goals 
which I proudly support. During this time of 
unrest as a result of different tragic encounters 
with police officers, I am especially proud of 
the inclusion of language that embraces my 
bill, H.R. 169—the Driver and Officer Safety 
Education Act. 
The language included in H.R. 2 would es-
tablish a grant program for states with specific 
standards for education and training programs 
concerning civilian and law enforcement en-
counters during traffic stops and other in-per-
son encounters. Originally intended to memori-
alize the fatal shooting of Philando Castile dur-
ing a 2016 traffic stop in Minnesota, this lan-
guage is both timely and extremely necessary 
given the recent tragic deaths of George Floyd 
and Rayshard Brooks who both died as a re-
sult of encounters with local law enforcement. 
Their lives mattered. The inclusion of my bill 
H.R. 169 in H.R. 2 advances us toward a bet-
ter understanding of how police and civilians 
should interact during traffic stops and other 
in-person encounters to save lives. However, 
to take the much-needed step toward effective 
reformation, we must also aim for reconcili-
ation. My resolution, H. Res. 992, calls for a 
Department of Reconciliation that would report 
directly to the President and be charged with 
eliminating systemic racism and invidious dis-
crimination from all aspects of American life. 
I thank my colleagues on the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee for including 
H.R. 169, and I look forward to H.R. 2 passing 
the Senate and hopefully being enacted as 
law. We cannot allow the multifaceted issues 
disproportionately affecting low-income com-
munities and communities of color to go 
unaddressed.
