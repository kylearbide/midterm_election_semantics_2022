Let us pray. 
Eternal God, the Lord of all, prepare 
our lawmakers today to serve You and 
country. Give them grateful hearts for 
Your daily blessings as they com-
prehend that their times are in Your 
hands. Lord, inspire them to make a

they may be vessels of honor for Your 
Kingdom. May they daily seek You and 
find joy in Your presence. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

f 
NOMINATION OF ANTONY JOHN 
BLINKEN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we 
move through the first full week of the 
Biden administration, the Senate will 
continue the important work of con-
firming President Biden’s Cabinet. 
Today, the Senate will hold a con-
firmation vote for Tony Blinken to be 
the next Secretary of State. Mr. 
Blinken is just the right person to re-
build and reassert America’s national 
security prerogatives on the global 
stage and reestablish the first instru-
ment of American power: diplomacy. 
For 4 years, the failed diplomacy of 
the Trump administration weakened 
our 
alliances, 
strengthened 
and 
emboldened our adversaries, and tar-
nished America’s reputation abroad. 
We must reaffirm our commitment to 
NATO and other critical alliances 
around the world. We must hold Russia 
accountable for its malicious inter-
ference in democracies. We must con-
front China’s economic, political, and 
human rights abuses. And we must 
work with the family of nations to 
combat the existential threat of cli-
mate change. 
Once confirmed, Mr. Blinken will 
also inherit a State Department work-
force in desperate need of a leader who 
knows that everyone on the team plays 
a critical role in advancing America’s 
interests 
abroad. 
Under 
President 
Trump, our Nation’s diplomats and 
State Department civilians were rel-
egated to the sidelines, and too many 
positions in the State Department were 
left vacant or relegated to irrelevance. 
None of this will be easy, but I am 
confident that Mr. Blinken is exactly 
the right person for the job. I look for-
ward to seeing this Chamber confirm 
his nomination later today. 
After that, both parties must keep 
working together to confirm the rest of 
President Biden’s outstanding Cabinet. 
We are off to a decent pace with the 
confirmations of the President’s Secre-
taries of Defense, Treasury, and Direc-
tor of National Intelligence. I appre-
ciate the Republican leader’s coopera-
tion and hope it will continue because 
our country needs that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S134 
January 26, 2021 
That pace must continue this week 
with the confirmation of the Secre-
taries of Homeland Security and Trans-
portation. After that, we need a Health 
and Human Services Secretary in-
stalled to oversee the public health re-
sponse to COVID; an Education Sec-
retary to facilitate the safe reopening 
of the schools, guided by the science; 
and a Secretary of HUD to help Amer-
ica’s struggling families stay in their 
homes during this horrible economic 
crisis. The Senate is working at an en-
couraging pace, and we will not let up. 
f 
ORGANIZING RESOLUTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on the organizing resolution, well, 
since the last time I addressed this 
Chamber, 
there 
has 
been 
notable 
progress in my discussions with the Re-
publican leader about organizing the 
Senate. Last night, the Republican 
leader dropped his demand for addi-
tional provisions on the organizing res-
olution and will agree to the 2001 rules 
that last governed the 50–50 Senate— 
exactly what Democrats proposed from 
the start. 
I am glad the Republican leader fi-
nally relented, and we can move for-
ward now to organize the Senate, Sen-
ate committees, chairs, and ranking 
members, and the process for moving 
bills and nominees to the floor from 
committees with an evenly divided 
number of Members. I am glad we are 
finally able to get the Senate up and 
running. My only regret is that it took 
so long because we have a great deal we 
need to accomplish over the next sev-
eral weeks and months. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on COVID, in addition to the confirma-
tion of critical Cabinet nominees, the 
Senate will soon move forward with 
legislation to address the twin crises 
facing our country: the public health 
crisis and the economic crisis. 
In December, Congress took the im-
portant step of passing interim emer-
gency relief to the country, but we left 
the job unfinished. I understand that 
recent opposition from the political 
right for more spending has increased 
in volume now that there is a Demo-
crat in the White House, but the pan-
demic doesn’t particularly care that 
there has been a change in the adminis-
tration. The needs of our country are 
still great, and the urgency to act is 
clearer than ever. 
The Congressional Budget Office told 
us last fall that the COVID–19 pan-
demic has taken more than $17 trillion 
out of our economy—$17 trillion. No 
doubt, Congress has passed substantial 
relief, but looking at the data, we are 
nowhere close to filling the COVID- 
sized hole in our economy. Expanded 
unemployment 
insurance 
will 
once 
again expire in March. State and local 
governments, which have already cut 
over a million jobs, are still reeling 
from budget deficits and have not re-
ceived direct assistance. The amount of 
direct payments to the American peo-
ple in the previous bill was regrettably 
much lower than many of us, including 
myself, wanted. We must continue sup-
porting the rapid and massive distribu-
tion of the vaccine to finally crush this 
virus once and for all. 
So the Senate is going to press for-
ward on another COVID-relief bill. We 
want to work with our Republican col-
leagues to advance this legislation in a 
bipartisan way, and the work must 
move forward—preferably, with our Re-
publican colleagues, but without them 
if we must. 
We are still in the midst of a once-in- 
a-century crisis that has reshaped our 
economy and altered nearly every as-
pect of American life. Americans are 
still getting sick. Americans are still 
dying. Americans are still losing their 
jobs. We must not suffer timidity or 
delay. There is great urgency to con-
tinue the work of COVID relief, and 
that is exactly what the Senate will do. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, two Democratic Senators con-
firmed they will not provide the votes 
to eliminate the legislative filibuster. 
The senior Senator from West Virginia 
issued a public ‘‘guarantee’’: ‘‘I do not 
support doing away with the filibuster 
under any condition.’’ 
Any chance of changing his mind? 
‘‘None whatsoever.’’ 
The senior Senator from Arizona 
made the same commitment. She op-
poses ending the legislative filibuster 
and 
‘‘is 
not 
open’’—not 
open—‘‘to 
changing her mind.’’ Our colleague in-
formed me directly last night that 
under no circumstances would she re-
verse course. 
Now, it should not be news that a few 
Members of the majority pledge they 
won’t tear up a central rule, but the 
Democratic leader was reluctant to re-
peat the step I took as majority leader 
in unified government when I ruled out 
that step on principle. 
Rather than relying on the Demo-
cratic leader, I took the discussion di-
rectly to his Members. Basic arith-
metic now ensures that there are not 
enough votes to break the rule. This 
victory will let us move forward with 
the 50–50 power-sharing agreement con-
taining all the elements of the 2001 
model because it will sit on the very 
same foundation. 
I want to discuss the precipice from 
which the Senate has stepped back. In 
2013, Senator Harry Reid began the 
‘‘nuclear’’ exchange over nominations. 
I said Democrats would regret it. A few 
years later, we have many Federal 
judges, including three Supreme Court 
Justices, who were confirmed with 
fewer than 60 votes. 
The back-and-forth exchange over 
nominations had one institutional sil-
ver lining, because, routinely, filibus-
tering nominations was itself a modern 
invention pioneered by Senate Demo-
crats in the 2000s. So, on nominations, 
for all the fighting, the Senate just 
simply circled back to the simple ma-
jority threshold that had been our 
longstanding norm on nominations; 
that is, on the Executive Calendar. 
Legislation is very different. When it 
comes to lawmaking, the Framers’ vi-
sion and our history are abundantly 
clear. The Senate exists to require de-
liberation 
and 
cooperation. 
James 
Madison said the Senate’s job was to 
provide 
a 
‘‘complicated 
check’’—a 
‘‘complicated check,’’ he said—against 
‘‘improper acts of legislation.’’ We en-
sure that laws earn enough buy-in to 
receive the lasting consent of the gov-
erned. We stop bad ideas, improve good 
ideas, and keep laws from swinging 
wildly with every election. 
Our friend, Lamar Alexander, put it 
this way in his farewell speech. He 
said: ‘‘The Senate exists to produce 
broad 
agreements 
on 
controversial 
issues that become laws most of us 
have voted for and that a diverse coun-
try will accept.’’ 
More than any other feature, it is the 
Senate’s 60-vote threshold to end de-
bate on legislation that achieves this. 
It ensures narrow interests cannot ig-
nore the rest of the country. It em-
bodies Jefferson’s maxim that ‘‘great 
innovations should not be forced on 
slender majorities.’’ 
The bar for lawmaking is high. It 
should be high, even if both bodies take 
turns at being slightly frustrated by it. 
If your legislation can’t pass the Sen-
ate, you don’t scrap the rules or lower 
the standards. You improve your idea, 
take your case to the people, or both. 
Four years ago, Republicans had just 
won unified control. President Trump 
and others pressured us heavily—me, in 
particular—to scrap this rule when it 
was protecting the Democratic minor-
ity. But we stood firm. I stood firm and 
endured many tweets on the subject. I 
said we would not do that to our col-
leagues in the minority. 
No short-term policy win justifies de-
stroying the Senate as we know it, es-
pecially since laws would become so 
brittle and reversible. So Democratic 
Senators used the 60-vote threshold to 
shape 
and 
block 
legislation. 
They 
stalled COVID relief, they blocked po-
lice reform, and they stopped even 
modest measures to protect innocent 
life because I chose not to destroy the 
tool that allowed them to do that. 
That same tool that some Democrats 
now want to destroy, they used freely 
and liberally throughout their years in 
the minority, and I protected their 
ability to do that. Republicans under-
stand you don’t destroy the Senate for 
a fleeting advantage. Our friends across 
the aisle must see the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S135 
January 26, 2021 
I have talked a lot about principle. 
We should also make this a little more 
tangible. So let’s take a look at what 
would happen if in fact the legislative 
filibuster were gone. If the Democratic 
majority were to attack the filibuster, 
they would guarantee themselves im-
mediate chaos, especially in this 50–50 
Senate. This body operates every day 
and every hour by consent, and de-
stroying the filibuster would drain 
comity and consent from this body to a 
degree that would be unparalleled in 
living memory. 
So let’s look at some examples. 
The Constitution requires the Senate 
to have a quorum to do any business. 
Right now, a quorum is 51, and the Vice 
President does not count to establish a 
quorum. The majority cannot even 
produce a quorum on their own, and 
one could be demanded by any Senator 
at almost any time. 
Our committees need quorums to 
function as well. They will also be 
evenly split. If this majority went 
scorched-earth, this body would grind 
to a halt like we have never seen. Tech-
nically, it takes collegiality and con-
sent for the majority to keep acting as 
the majority at any time they do not 
physically—physically—have the ma-
jority. 
In 
a 
scorched-earth, 
post-nuclear 
Senate that is 50–50 like we have today, 
every Senate Democrat and the Vice 
President could essentially just block 
out the next 2 years on their calendar. 
They would have to be here all the 
time. 
It takes unanimous consent to sched-
ule most votes, to schedule speeches, to 
convene before noon, to schedule many 
hearings and markups. As Democrats 
just spent 4 years reminding us, it 
takes consent to confirm even the low-
est level nominees at anything beyond 
a snail’s pace. 
None of us has ever seen a Senate 
where every single thing either hap-
pens in the hardest possible way or not 
at all. Heck, once or twice every day 
the majority leader reads through an 
entire paragraph of routine requests. 
Objections could turn each one into 
multiple, lengthy rollcall votes. 
None of us on either side wants to 
live in a scorched-earth Senate. The in-
stitution and the American people de-
serve a lot better. But there is no 
doubt—none—that is what we would 
see if Democrats tear up this pivotal 
rule. It would become immediately and 
painfully clear to the Democratic ma-
jority that they had indeed just broken 
the Senate. 
This gambit would not speed the 
Democrats’ ambitions. It would delay 
them terribly, and it would hamstring 
the Biden Presidency over a power grab 
which the President has spent decades 
warning against and still opposes. 
Finally, at some point, the shoe 
would find its way to the other foot. 
When Republicans next control the 
government, we would be able to repeal 
every bill that had just been rammed 
through, and we would set about de-
fending the unborn, exploring domestic 
energy, 
unleashing 
free 
enterprise, 
defunding sanctuary cities, securing 
the border, protecting workers’ pay-
checks from union bosses—you get the 
picture. 
But a few years later, the Democrats 
would try to flip it all back. So instead 
of building stable consensus, we would 
be chaotically swapping party plat-
forms, swinging wildly between oppo-
site visions that would guarantee half 
the country is miserable and resentful 
at any given time. We would have in-
herited resilient institutions but left 
behind a chaotic mess. 
We are in a politically charged pe-
riod, but when factional fever runs hot, 
when 
slender 
majorities 
are 
most 
tempted to ram through radicalism, 
these are the times for which the 
guardrails exist in the first place. 
Republicans said no—emphatically 
no—to pushing the Senate over this 
precipice. When I could have tried to 
grab the power, I turned it down. I said: 
‘‘President Trump, no,’’ repeatedly, be-
cause the Nation needs us to respect 
the Framers’ design and the Senate’s 
structure, and because, as I said in a 
different context on January 6, we have 
a higher calling than endless partisan 
escalation. 
We have placed our trust in the insti-
tution itself, in a common desire to do 
the right thing. I am grateful that has 
been reciprocated by at least a pair of 
our colleagues across the aisle. I am 
glad that we have stepped back from 
this cliff. Taking that plunge would 
not be some progressive dream; it 
would be a nightmare. I guarantee it.

FILIBUSTER 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has 
been my good fortune to serve in the 
Senate for 24 years. I have great re-
spect for this institution and continue 
to believe that the men and women 
who serve here are extraordinary ex-
amples, by and large, of public service 
and that we have done great things of 
a historic nature. 
I think of the days of the Obama 
Presidency, when we had to rescue our 
economy, make reforms on Wall Street 
that made a difference, and build a 
public health system that we have as-
pired to for decades. We achieved those 
goals—not easily—with hard work and 
determination. I am glad to have been 
a part of it. 
When I hear the Republican leader 
come to the floor and talk about his 
memory of the Senate, I hasten to add: 
There is another side to the story. I 
will come to the floor in a few days to 
outline the history of the filibuster, 
but I am sure the Senator from Ken-
tucky, who has been in the Senate— 
and his staff—in elected capacity for 
decades, would concede this point: Up 
until the 1960s, the filibuster was rare-
ly used in this U.S. Senate. The de-
mand for, once, 67 votes, then 60 votes 
was rare. 
Oh, it was remembered that, in the 
1960s, civil rights legislation foundered 
on the floor of this U.S. Senate because 
of the filibuster, but it was rarely ap-
plied. That changed. It changed under 
the Senator from Kentucky’s leader-
ship. It became so commonplace—the 
filibuster 
was 
being 
used 
so 
fre-
quently—that it led to Senator Reid, 
then the Democratic leader, making 
some fundamental changes in the Sen-
ate rules. 
I remember that day very well, and I 
remember the anguish that Senator 
Reid felt at the time. But he felt he 
had no recourse because the filibuster 
had become commonplace, the 60-vote 
requirement commonplace. 
I don’t know exactly what the argu-
ment is from the other side at the mo-
ment, but I think any fairminded Sen-
ator would concede the Senate is capa-
ble of doing great things; it is capable 
of being deliberative; yet it still can be 
decisive. 
There comes a time when we should 
act. And to merely let every issue get 
mired down into a 60-vote requirement 
and filibuster and nothing come out of 
this Chamber as a result cannot be 
what our Founding Fathers envisioned 
for the world of the U.S. Senate. 
I want to address that issue at an-
other time in more detail, with facts 
and figures on the use and misuse of 
filibuster, but at this moment I would 
like to raise another question, which is 
related. 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO NICHOLAS 
MAYORKAS 
Mr. President, we are in the midst of 
a global pandemic. More than 420,000 
American lives have been lost. Just 3 
short weeks ago, 20 days ago, this Cap-
itol, this age-old symbol of America, 
was attacked by homegrown domestic 
terrorists. It was overrun for the first 
time since the British invasion in the 
War of 1812.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S136 
January 26, 2021 
After this horrific attack on this 
Capitol by this mob—insurrectionist 
mob—I hope the United States can fi-
nally come to grips with the reality of 
terrorism today. 
I remember 9/11 very well. Who could 
forget it if you lived through it? I was 
in this building and fully expected an 
attack on this structure. We ran out, 
down the steps onto the grassy lawn, 
and stood, wondering what to do next. 
This was going to be the next target. 
Thank goodness for the heroism of 
those who came forward and took con-
trol of the plane—at least diverted it 
into Pennsylvania. 
Some would dismiss the insurrec-
tionist mob as just another rowdy po-
litical crowd not unlike many other po-
litical demonstrations. In fact, I have 
heard comparisons of Black Lives Mat-
ter rallies to the terrorist attack of 
January 6. 
But there was a fundamental dif-
ference 20 days ago. That fundamental 
difference is the fact that five Ameri-
cans died as a result of that mob invad-
ing the Capitol, including one Capitol 
policeman. We have heard rumors of 
the details of how he died. I am sure we 
are going to hear more as the inves-
tigation continues. But this was just 
not another political demonstration. It 
was an example of terrorism, period— 
American-grown, American-sponsored. 
The security of our Nation is still at 
stake. There was a demonstration yes-
terday in downtown Chicago by White 
supremacists. Over 80 of them gath-
ered—over 80 of them—in downtown 
Chicago to stand up and defiantly show 
that they were still alive and well and 
ready to act. 
The very least we can do is to ensure 
that the Agency responsible for our 
protection against this sort of ter-
rorism has leadership. That Agency is 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
President Biden has suggested a man 
to 
lead 
that 
Department: 
Ali 
Mayorkas. He is an extraordinary pub-
lic servant. The Senate has confirmed 
him three times. He previously served 
for 7 years at this Agency. He has been 
nominated now to lead it. 
Most recently, he served as the De-
partment of Homeland Security Dep-
uty Secretary, the agent second in 
command and chief operating officer. 
He was in charge of counterterrorism, 
cyber security, border security, emer-
gency management, and other critical 
matters. He did the job and did it well. 
We need him again. We need his ex-
pertise and experience at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security today— 
today. 
Perhaps the Republicans have forgot-
ten about the last 4 years of failed pol-
icy and chaos at the Department of 
Homeland Security. Just a little re-
minder: It was under President Trump 
that the Agency experienced an un-
precedented leadership vacuum. 
Consider this: The Department of 
Homeland Security lurched from one 
Secretary or Acting Secretary to the 
next. Six—six people headed that Agen-
cy during the Trump administration. 
Only two of them were confirmed by 
the U.S. Senate. That is more Agency 
heads in the last 4 years than in the 13- 
year history of the Department of 
Homeland Security before the Trump 
administration. 
They couldn’t keep a leader in place. 
The President was firing them, and 
they were resigning right and left. For 
over a year, that Agency, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, was led by 
an unlawfully appointed Acting Sec-
retary, Chad Wolf. Then, just 9 days be-
fore Donald Trump left the White 
House, Mr. Wolf resigned, replaced by 
yet another Acting Secretary. 
An Agency with the critical task of 
keeping America safe, keeping our 
families safe, couldn’t even agree on 
who would head the Agency. 
Four former Secretaries of Homeland 
Security—two Republicans and two 
Democrats—every person who served as 
a 
Senate-confirmed 
DHS 
Secretary 
prior to the Trump administration, say 
that Ali Mayorkas is the man for the 
job. They said he is ‘‘a man of char-
acter, integrity, experience, and com-
passion,’’ and ‘‘a proven leader to right 
the ship.’’ 
In 
their 
endorsement 
of 
Mr. 
Mayorkas, they went on to say: The 
leadership vacuum and turmoil at the 
Department of Homeland Security may 
have contributed to the failure to an-
ticipate and adequately prepare for the 
attack on the Capitol. 
That is the reality. After 4 years of 
disorder and disarray at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, the secu-
rity of America, including the security 
of this very building, suffered because 
of lack of leadership under the Trump 
administration. 
Over the last 4 years, we have 
watched the politicization of the De-
partment of Justice and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. We have 
seen some horrible things occur: Oper-
ation Zero Tolerance—2,700 infants, ba-
bies, and children separated from their 
parents at the border of the United 
States, cast into a bureaucratic system 
and forgotten until a Federal judge in 
Southern California said: Enough. I 
want to know who those kids are, and 
I want to know why they haven’t been 
reunited with their parents. That was 
months after they had been separated. 
I went to an immigration court in 
Chicago, downtown in the Loop, in a 
big high-rise office building. I didn’t 
expect to find a court, but I did. I got 
off the elevator, and the walls were 
lined with people. The hallways were 
packed with those waiting for a hear-
ing before this immigration court. 
I met the judge. She had been on the 
bench there in the immigration court 
for almost 20 years. She was a good 
person. You could tell. She said: Sen-
ator, I wish you would stay for the 
docket call this morning in this immi-
gration court. 
This was in the middle of this zero- 
tolerance separation from their par-
ents. 
I want you to see the first two clients 
who are going to come before us. 
I waited. They called the docket, and 
they said that everyone in the court-
room should be seated. There was dif-
ficulty seating one of the persons on 
the docket. Marta was her name. She 
was 2 years old. She had to be lifted 
into a chair and handed a stuffed ani-
mal. Luckily, the little boy, who, coin-
cidentally, had the name Hamilton, 
was enticed to climb up on the chair 
when they put a Matchbox car on the 
table—two of the children separated by 
the zero-tolerance policy of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security under 
President Trump. 
There was, of course, a decision to 
postpone any hearing on their case for 
6 months. They were put back into the 
system. I don’t know what ultimately 
happened in the meantime. But I can 
tell you this: It was months before 
Marta was returned to her parent. 
Some of these separated children would 
not even let their own mothers hold 
them after they were reunited. They 
felt that they had been abandoned. 
But they had not been abandoned by 
their mothers. They had been aban-
doned by anyone with a conscience at 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
That is what happened, and that is 
what happened under that Agency in a 
Trump administration. 
Is it any wonder that we need new 
leadership, that we need an accounting 
of these children? There are still re-
ports, heartbreaking reports that more 
than 600 children are still adrift in the 
system, never reunited with their fami-
lies. I will tell you, if it is within my 
power, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee will certainly investigate that. 
The failure of the Department of 
Homeland Security in that instance is 
going to be one of the most shameful 
chapters in the modern history of the 
United States. The failure of our Na-
tion’s national security leaders to ad-
dress the threat of violent White su-
premacists and other far-right extre-
mism really gives evidence as to why 
we need to fill this spot immediately. 
What is the problem? President Biden 
has 
nominated 
Ali 
Mayorkas. 
Ali 
Mayorkas has turned in his paperwork 
required by law, has submitted his 
name for a hearing, and appeared be-
fore a committee of Congress. Why 
isn’t he being approved here? 
One Senator, a Senator from Mis-
souri, has a hold on his nomination. 
Why? Well, he may disagree with him 
on some policies, he said publicly. I am 
sure he does. I am sure he disagrees on 
many policies. Is that enough? Is that 
enough to say that this critical Agency 
will not have a leader because the Sen-
ator of Missouri disagrees with him on 
a policy? 
Occasionally, I tune in to FOX to see 
what folks are saying there. The other 
night, last week, when I tuned in, there 
was this breathless reporting of a 
Brown-skinned invasion at our bor-
der—thousands in caravans destined 
for the United States. Over and over

again we have heard that story. What 
Agency is responsible for making sure 
that their arrival on our border is or-
derly, that they do not cross the border 
improperly? It is the Department of 
Homeland Security—the same Agency 
that is being denied leadership by one 
Senator on the other side of the aisle. 
It is time to get over it. It is time to 
give President Biden the leadership we 
need at that Agency as quickly as pos-
sible. 
We, in contrast, know that America 
is a unique nation, and what makes it 
special is that people from all over the 
world can come to our shores and be-
come Americans, not because of their 
race or ethnicity but because they em-
brace America’s democratic ideals. 
The son of a Holocaust survivor and 
an 
immigrant 
from 
Cuba, 
Mr. 
Mayorkas knows firsthand that Amer-
ica can be a beacon of hope and prom-
ise to those facing persecution. Mr. 
Mayorkas is an experienced national 
security leader who can restore integ-
rity and decency at the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
I personally appreciated the skill and 
dedication he showed as Director of the 
United States Citizenship and Immi-
gration Services. There, in the year 
2012, he implemented DACA—the De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals— 
that allowed for more than 800,000 
young people to have a chance to be 
part of America. As Deputy Secretary, 
Mr. Mayorkas oversaw a $60 billion 
budget and led a workforce of 230,000 
individuals. He is the right man for the 
job, and he should be on the job today. 
He excelled in that role, receiving 
the Department’s Distinguished Serv-
ice Award—the highest civilian honor— 
the U.S. Coast Guard’s Distinguished 
Service Award, and a special com-
mendation from the National Security 
Agency for his achievements in na-
tional security and cyber security. 
Among his numerous responsibilities, 
he led the Department’s response to 
the Zika and Ebola outbreaks—highly 
relevant and timely expertise we could 
use now in this COVID–19 pandemic. 
He served as a Senate-confirmed U.S. 
attorney to California earlier in his ca-
reer. 
The national president of the Fra-
ternal Order of Police has enthusiasti-
cally endorsed Mr. Mayorkas and said, 
‘‘His professionalism, integrity and 
commitment to just and fair enforce-
ment of the law makes him an ideal 
candidate to lead the department. Mr. 
Mayorkas has pursued criminal wrong-
doers and has protected the rights of 
the innocent with indefatigable vigor. 
His work reflects all that is right in 
the government.’’ 
That was the statement from the 
Fraternal Order of Police about this 
nominee. He is an outstanding nominee 
to be Secretary of Homeland Security. 
His experience, qualifications, exper-
tise, and integrity will serve America 
well at a time we desperately need him. 
I ask the Senator who is holding his 
nomination to release the hold today. 
Let Mr. Mayorkas go to the head of 
this Agency where he is desperately 
needed and show the kind of leadership 
he has over and over again for this 
country. 
I urge my colleagues to expeditiously 
confirm Mr. Mayorkas so that he can 
serve as the next Secretary of Home-
land Security. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip is recog-
nized. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there has 
been a lot of talk about the legislative 
filibuster here in the Senate over the 
last few days. As we started the new 
Congress evenly divided between Re-
publicans and Democrats, the Repub-
lican leader had proposed that the 
Democrat leader include a commit-
ment to preserving the legislative fili-
buster and the power-sharing agree-
ment the leaders have been working 
out. This should have been easy. 
Less than 4 years ago, with a Repub-
lican President in the White House and 
Republicans in control of the Senate 
and the House of Representatives, a bi-
partisan group of 61 Senators affirmed 
their support for retaining the legisla-
tive filibuster, stating: ‘‘We are united 
in our determination to preserve the 
ability of Members to engage in ex-
tended debate when bills are on the 
Senate floor.’’ 
There are 26—26—current Democratic 
Senators—a majority of the current 
Democratic caucus—who signed that 
defense of the legislative filibuster 
when they were in the Senate minor-
ity. It is disappointing that the Demo-
crat leader failed to express his support 
for this essential Senate rule. 
Nevertheless, thanks to the recent 
commitment from two Senate Demo-
crats to oppose any attempt to elimi-
nate 
the 
filibuster—a 
commitment 
which secures this key protection for 
minority rights—Leader MCCONNELL is 
now moving forward without a state-
ment from the Democrat leader. 
But it is worth taking a moment to 
reiterate why the legislative filibuster 
is so important. The legislative fili-
buster, of course, is essentially the re-
quirement that 60 Senators agree be-
fore the Senate can end debate and 
vote on a bill. In other words, you need 
60 percent of the Senate to agree before 
you can pass a bill. This usually means 
that you need the support of at least 
some Members of the other party be-
fore you can move legislation. 
The party in power doesn’t always 
enjoy that rule. All of us would like 
the opportunity to pass exactly the 
legislation that we want. But most of 
us recognize that it is a good require-
ment. 
The 
legislative 
filibuster 
ensures 
that the minority is represented in the 
legislation. This would be important 
even if elections tended to break 60 to 
40 or 70 to 30 in favor of one party or 
another. All Americans, whether or not 
they are in the majority, deserve to be 
represented. But it is particularly im-
portant when you consider that our 
country is pretty evenly split down the 
middle. 
While the advantage sometimes goes 
to Democrats and sometimes to Repub-
licans, the truth is that our country is 
pretty evenly split, which means any 
attempt to disenfranchise the minority 
party means disenfranchising half of 
the country. 
Of course, the party in power gen-
erally gets to accomplish more than 
the minority party—and that is appro-
priate. The country may be fairly even-
ly divided, but sometimes it wants to 
move more toward one side or the 
other. 
What is not appropriate is to elimi-
nate meaningful minority representa-
tion, which would be the consequence 
of eliminating the legislative fili-
buster. Our Founders recognized the 
importance of putting safeguards in 
place 
to 
ensure 
that 
majorities 
wouldn’t curtail or eliminate minority 
rights. 
That is why the Founders created the 
Senate. They made the Senate smaller 
and Senators’ terms in office longer, 
with the intention of creating a more 
stable, more thoughtful, and more de-
liberative legislative body to check ill- 
considered or intemperate legislation 
or attempts to curtail minority rights. 
And as time has gone on, the legisla-
tive filibuster is the Senate rule that 
has had perhaps the greatest impact in 
preserving the Founders’ vision of the 
Senate. Thanks to the filibuster, it is 
often harder to get legislation through 
the Senate than the House. It requires 
more thought, more debate, and great-
er consensus—in other words, exactly— 
exactly—what the Founders were look-
ing for. 
I am grateful to my Democrat col-
leagues who have spoken up about 
their commitment to preserving the 
legislative filibuster. Republicans were 
committed to protecting the vital safe-
guard of minority rights when we were 
in the majority—despite, I might add, 
the then-President’s calls repeatedly to 
eliminate it—and I appreciate that a 
number of my Democrat colleagues 
share that commitment. 
I am particularly grateful to the Sen-
ator from West Virginia and the Sen-
ator from Arizona for their uncompro-
mising defense of minority rights and 
the institution of the Senate here in 
recent days. 
Again, however, I am disappointed 
the Democrat leader chose not to ex-
press his support for this essential Sen-
ate rule. I would point out that when 
Democrats were in the minority in the 
Senate, they made frequent use of the 
legislative filibuster. 
I hope that the commitment to the 
legislative 
filibuster 
expressed 
by 
President Biden and a number of Sen-
ate Democrats means the end of any 
talk of eliminating the filibuster. No 
matter how appealing it might be in 
the moment, destroying this long-
standing protection for minority rights

would be a grave error that both par-
ties would live to regret. 
I hope that all Senate Democrats will 
recommit themselves to preserving 
this fundamental feature of the Senate 
and to find compromise. We have work 
to do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ANTONY JOHN BLINKEN 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today we 
will be considering the nomination of 
Antony 
Blinken 
to 
be 
President 
Biden’s Secretary of State. 
The problem I have with this nomi-
nation is that, for decades now, we 
have been at war in Afghanistan. The 
war is now called ‘‘the forever war.’’ 
People lament that it goes on so long, 
and people say: How could it possibly 
keep going on? 
Sixty-five to seventy percent of the 
American people, 65 to 70 percent of 
American 
veterans—veterans 
who 
served in the theater—say the war is 
enough. We should end the war in Af-
ghanistan. How does it go on? We have 
got a new President. Are things going 
to change? 
Here is the problem: Why do the wars 
continue? Why do the wars in Syria 
and Libya and Somalia and Afghani-
stan 
continue? 
Because 
the 
more 
things change, the more they stay the 
same. 
Mr. Blinken has been a full-throated 
advocate of military intervention in 
the Middle East for 20 years. We are 
fooling ourselves if we think we are 
going to get a new policy. We are going 
to get more of the same. 
In his hearing, I said to him: ‘‘The 
problem isn’t that we don’t com-
promise or that we don’t have bipar-
tisan consensus; the problem is we 
have too much bipartisan consensus for 
war.’’ 
For 20 years, he has advocated for 
military intervention. He advocated for 
the Iraq war, as did the President. 
President Biden was also an advocate 
of the Iraq war. 
Now, later on they said: Well, the 
war wasn’t that great of an idea, but 
we were lied to by George Bush and the 
intelligence, and I am willing to admit 
there is some truth to that. But there 
is a bigger lesson here. The lesson is 
that regime change doesn’t work. 
They 
often 
get 
unintended 
con-
sequences, and you often get the oppo-
site of what you think you are getting. 
They said: We must go to Iraq to topple 
Saddam Hussein because he is a ter-
rible dictator. Well, yes, he was a des-
pot, a dictator, an autocrat. You know, 
he wreaked havoc on his people, prob-
ably gassed the Kurds—many different 
horrible things. And yet, when he was 
gone, what did we get? We got a power 
vacuum. We got more terrorism. We 
are back in there 10 years later because 
the government is nonfunctional. And 
what is the final result? Iran is strong-
er. 
What does everybody talk about? 
Iran, Iran, Iran. Why do we worry 
about Iran? Well, because we toppled 
their biggest adversary. We used to 
have a balance of power between Iraq 
and Iran—despot on one side, despot on 
the other but at least a balance of 
power. 
But who is Iran’s best ally now? Iraq. 
Think about it. Iraq is allied with Iran. 
Iraq is also allied, in many ways, with 
Russia, as well as us, but they have 
also asked us to leave. They are like: 
Oh, thanks for our freedom, but you all 
can take off now. 
But who supported the war? Presi-
dent Biden, Antony Blinken. We are 
back where we were 20 years ago. 
Now, like I say, there is some re-
trenchment, there is some backing off 
of the position, but I don’t hear from 
either 
President 
Biden, 
Candidate 
Biden, or from Antony Blinken that re-
gime change is wrong. 
Now, if it were wrong, you would ex-
pect there was a learning from the Iraq 
war, and they would say: OK. Now that 
we are in charge, we won’t do the same. 
But it turns out, when we had an 
Obama administration, with Blinken 
and the other military intervention-
ists, in a supposedly progressive admin-
istration, we got more war. They went 
into Libya. Once again, the same sort 
of idea—the idea that regime change 
works, and that we will topple this ter-
rible dictator, Qadhafi, and out of the 
mist, out of the embers, out of the fire 
will 
arise 
Thomas 
Jefferson. 
The 
Thomas Jefferson of Libya will take 
over and freedom will reign. It didn’t 
work out so much. 
So Mr. Blinken, in his hearing, ad-
mitted as much. He said: Well, maybe 
we overestimated the possibility that 
there would be rivals to replace him. 
Do you think? 
But, see, this is sort of the expected 
pattern of the Middle East. The Middle 
East 
doesn’t 
have 
this 
1,000-year 
English tradition of trying to control 
central power, dating back to even be-
fore the Magna Carta. 
But even 350 years ago, the English 
had a revolution trying to restrain the 
power of the King; 250 years ago we had 
our revolution to further restrain the 
power of the King. We have this long-
standing tradition. 
But in the Middle East, there is more 
of this tradition of tribalism, and so 
you have an iron fist, but when you get 
rid of the iron fist, it is replaced by an-
other iron fist or nothing—by chaos. 
So in Libya you get rid of Qadhafi— 
supported by President Obama, Vice 
President Biden, Antony Blinken. You 
have the toppling of Qadhafi, but what 
did you get? Chaos. More terrorism. It 
is unclear even whom we support— 
whether we support the current gov-
ernment, the U.N. government, or Gen-
eral Haftar, or whom we support. 
The Middle East is divided, arms are 
flowing in on both sides, and like we al-
ways do, we fan the flames by shipping 
arms to everybody in the region as 
well. It didn’t work. 
So Mr. Blinken acknowledges: Yes, 
we 
underestimated 
the 
possibility 
there would be a rival government or a 
rival faction strong enough to rule 
Libya. Well, yeah. 
So did they learn their lesson? No. 
About this time or a little bit later, 
they decided: We must go into Syria. 
So they spent about $500 million—$500 
million—to train about 60 fighters. 
They did it in a remote area of Syria 
and they got them trained and they 
spent their $500 million and they sent 
10 of them into battle. They were all 
captured or killed in the first 20 min-
utes. Five hundred million to train 
sixty of the so-called moderates. But 
guess what. The same holds for Syria 
that held for Iraq, that held for Libya, 
that now holds for Syria. Guess what. 
Another despot. 
But who are the people fighting 
against the despot? The most fierce 
fighters in Syria all along were al- 
Nusra 
and 
al-Qaida. 
The 
more 
jihadists, the more vicious and violent 
and the better the fighters were. 
Were there doctors and lawyers and 
academics and people who want a sec-
ular form of government? Sure. But the 
people out there fighting and the peo-
ple winning the battles were the 
jihadists. 
So there was always the danger, if 
you get rid of Assad, we get another 
jihadist regime. 
So we have to think through the pol-
icy of this. But Blinken and Biden both 
supported the Iraq war. It was an utter 
failure. They admit as much. They sup-
ported the Libyan deposing of Qadhafi 
and war. Then they acknowledge: Well, 
maybe it wasn’t the best—but then 
they don’t take any learning or knowl-
edge from that and say: Maybe we 
shouldn’t go into the next one—Syria. 
And yet, they went into Syria. 
And 
what 
Blinken’s 
response 
is 
should tell you a little bit about the 
danger of what we may get from 
Blinken as Secretary of State. 
He said the problem in Syria was not 
doing too much but doing too little. He 
said: What we really should have done 
is gone in with full might. If we had 
put 100,000 troops in there, like we did 
in Afghanistan and like we did in Iraq, 
if we would have used sufficient enough 
force, we could have toppled Assad. But 
in the end, he said: We didn’t do 
enough. 
So the lesson to Blinken and Biden 
and this administration isn’t that re-
gime change doesn’t work; it is that if 
we are going to do it, we need to go 
bigger. We need to go all in. 
I would posit that regime change 
doesn’t work; that we should not sup-
port evil regimes. If they are despots or 
dictators, we shouldn’t arm them. But 
I am not for toppling every one of them

either because I am not so sure what 
you get next. 
So how would this be in the real 
world? Saudi Arabia has shown them-
selves to be an autocratic, anti-woman, 
anti-modern administration that would 
actually kill a journalist and dis-
member him. They were rewarded by 
the previous administration with arms. 
Terrible idea. 
But what would we do if there was a 
rational, realistic—more realism in 
foreign policy? We would not topple the 
Government of Saudi Arabia, but we 
might not sell them arms. I think that 
would be a reasonable thing. 
We also might not sell them arms be-
cause they were committing atrocities 
and killing civilians in the war in 
Yemen. But if you look back at the war 
in Yemen, the Obama-Biden adminis-
tration did not have very strong oppo-
sition to the war in Yemen. They do 
now, but in the beginning, they didn’t. 
And so the supplying of weaponry 
and bombs and smart bombs to Saudi 
Arabia occurred under the Obama- 
Biden administration and then contin-
ued under the Trump administration. 
So we have to ask ourselves: We have 
so many unintended consequences; how 
will we ever make things different? 
Now, our Founding Fathers envi-
sioned something different. Our Found-
ing Fathers envisioned that war should 
be difficult. It was James Madison who 
said that the executive branch is most 
prone to war and, therefore, the Con-
stitution, with studied care, vested 
that power in the legislature. To de-
clare war was to be split between the 
House and the Senate and by a major-
ity vote to declare war. We don’t do 
that. It is passe. Oh, that is an anach-
ronism, some say. 
And when Antony Blinken was asked 
about this, when he was asked about a 
use of authorization of force—he was 
asked: Do you need it? And this was 
when he was working for the Obama- 
Biden administration. And he said: Oh, 
we would welcome discussion and de-
bate and advice from the Senate, but, 
you know, we don’t really need it. 
Now, he is not alone in this. This 
isn’t 
a 
Democratic 
or 
Republican 
thing. This is most of the foreign pol-
icy establishment in both parties, par-
ticularly once they work for a Presi-
dent. They will tell you, yes, they will 
listen to your advice. Oh, we really 
welcome your coming down. Please 
come down. We would love to sit down 
and have tea. But, really, don’t tell us 
what to do. We can do whatever we 
want under article II. 
And you think, well gosh, that 
sounds harsh. It sounds like you are de-
scribing Blinken as some sort of John 
Bolton. Yeah. There are similarities, 
but there are similarities between both 
parties when they get to the executive 
branch that they don’t think they need 
Congress’s permission. This is a real 
problem. 
So some in the Senate have tried to 
narrow the definition of where a war 
would be, and I looked at their nar-
rower definition last time and I said: 
Well, yeah, you would narrow it from 
the whole world to 24 countries. I don’t 
want to be at war in those 24 countries 
either. 
Think about it. We have more mili-
tary action in Africa right now than we 
do in the Middle East. Somalia, Mali, 
all throughout Africa we have got 
troops. 
We had four soldiers die a little over 
a year ago in Mali, and people were 
like: We have 800 soldiers in Mali? No 
one even knew. People on the Armed 
Services Committee were like: We have 
800 soldiers in Mali? And yet that goes 
on without our permission. Without a 
vote of the people’s representatives, 
without consulting the people at all, it 
just goes on and on and on. 
So my opposition of Mr. Blinken to 
be Secretary of State is not so much 
because I oppose the administration; it 
is because I oppose the bipartisan con-
sensus for war. 
If we are ever to end these wars, we 
are going to need to not keep nomi-
nating the same retreads who have got-
ten us into these wars. 
So I will vote against Mr. Blinken be-
cause I am against war. I am against 
war that is not declared by Congress. I 
am against war that is executed pri-
marily by the President. I am against 
them doing it without the permission 
of the people. 
So I will oppose Mr. Blinken’s nomi-
nation. I don’t think I will get many 
people from the other side. It is dif-
ficult to vote against nominees of one’s 
own party, but I will say that if we are 
ever to end war, we need to have a real 
discussion in this body about when we 
go to war, whether or not we have to 
declare war, and we have to talk about 
whether our involvements have worked 
in the Middle East, whether or not 
there are unintended consequences. In-
stead of saying ‘‘Oh, it was all George 
Bush’s fault. It was faulty intel-
ligence’’—yeah, yeah, there is some 
truth to that, but it is really about re-
gime change. It is about the idea that 
we know what is best for everyone else 
and that by putting a new regime in-
volved in a country in the Middle East, 
somehow it is going to be better. It 
usually turns out worse. 
So I hope my colleagues will today 
consider voting against Mr. Blinken be-
cause I think he is more of the same. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 3 min-
utes 
on 
the 
nomination 
of 
Tony 
Blinken for Secretary of State. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I bring to 
the floor this morning the nomination 
of Tony Blinken to be Secretary of 
State. He has been nominated, of 
course, by President Biden, and this is 
brought by Senator MENENDEZ and me. 
We have had the honored privilege of 
working together to move as rapidly as 
we could Mr. Blinken’s nomination. 
Obviously, these things do take some 
time, and we are fortunate to be able 
to bring it as quickly as we have to the 
floor. 
This is, in my judgment, certainly 
the most important nominee that there 
will be to the President’s Cabinet in 
light of a number of things but not the 
least of which is they are in the line of 
succession for the Presidency. 
Mr. Blinken has a long and distin-
guished history when it comes to 
statecraft and foreign relations mat-
ters. Certainly, he is very qualified for 
this job. Obviously, we don’t agree on 
all things. Nobody ever does. 
I will say that there are 200 coun-
tries, approximately, on the planet, 
and each one of them has unique and 
very distinguished issues. 
In speaking with Mr. Blinken on 
these matters, I find that there is a 
tremendous amount of agreement that 
he and I have. Obviously, whenever 
these things happen, there are areas of 
disagreement, and obviously the media 
and a lot of people focus on these. 
I should mention that at least one of 
those—Iran—is a very wide disagree-
ment that we have. In my judgment, 
the JCPOA was a colossal failure and a 
real blunder for American policy over-
seas. In talking with Mr. Blinken, he 
does not share that view, and obviously 
he is going to work with the President, 
carrying the President’s water to get 
us back into the JCPOA. I think that is 
a mistake. We have talked about this 
at length, and certainly whatever the 
consequences of that are, those who do 
it are going to have to live with it. 
I can state that this is not a partisan 
issue. There are people on both sides of 
the aisle who have real reservations 
about going back into the JCPOA, par-
ticularly if there aren’t very signifi-
cant sideboards put on that. The effort 
is going to be made, and we will advise 
as we can and go down that pike. 
Again, I say that this is one issue. 
Out of the many, many issues that we 
discussed, there was very little—in 
fact, no daylight between us on some of 
them. A good example of that would be 
Turkey. I think Mr. Blinken shares my 
reservations about Turkey, and, again, 
the vast majority of this body, the U.S. 
Senate, has deep, deep reservations 
about the direction that Turkey is 
going. 
In any event, we need a Secretary of 
State, and this is the person for the 
job. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 
minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
just remark how quickly you have 
risen in the Senate. So we welcome you 
here. 
I rise today in support of Tony 
Blinken’s nomination to be Secretary

January 26, 2021 
of State. I want to thank Senator 
RISCH
for working with me expedi-
tiously to get this nomination to the 
floor, and I appreciate his work and 
common cause to achieve it. 
We all know Mr. Blinken has impres-
sive credentials. He was confirmed by 
the Senate as Deputy Secretary of 
State, and before that, he served as the 
Deputy National Security Advisor and 
as the staff director at the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee. But apart 
from 
his 
extensive 
experience, 
he 
showed in almost 5 hours of hearing 
testimony that he is thoughtful, will-
ing, able to grapple with the most com-
plex challenging issues facing our 
country, and committed to engaging 
Congress, and he did so on both sides of 
the aisle. 
Not surprisingly, the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee reported him out by 
an overwhelming bipartisan vote. 
Now, some in this body may not be 
aware of Mr. Blinken’s family tradi-
tion, which reflects the best of this 
country in two ways: our history of 
welcoming those in need of refuge and 
the contributions that immigrants and 
refugees have made in the service of 
our Nation. 
Mr. Blinken’s family came here flee-
ing persecution. His grandfather, Mau-
rice Blinken, fled Russian pogroms. His 
father’s wife, Vera Blinken, fled com-
munist Hungary, and his late step-
father, Samuel Pisar, survived Nazi 
concentration camps and met the first 
U.S. soldiers he saw with the only 
English words he knew: God bless 
America. And from that family, our 
country has benefitted from the service 
of two Ambassadors, an Assistant Sec-
retary, and a Deputy Secretary of 
State—what a testament to the power 
of the American Dream. 
Mr. Blinken must be confirmed so we 
can start addressing the challenges we 
face abroad. Every day there is an 
event or calamity across the globe, and 
whether it is a massacre in Ethiopia or 
democratic protests in Russia, we need 
U.S. leadership and engagement to 
chart our foreign policy through these 
troubling times. 
We now have a COVID vaccine, but 
troubling new variants and strains are 
appearing in the United Kingdom and 
South Africa. We need a confirmed Sec-
retary of State and a robust State De-
partment to revitalize the traditional 
U.S. role as a leader on global health 
issues. This is just one of the many 
things we have to do to bring this pan-
demic to an end both in this country 
and abroad. 
It is also important that Mr. Blinken 
be confirmed to help address the chal-
lenges we face closer to home. The 
State Department is suffering from a 
historic crisis stemming from low mo-
rale, the departure over the past 4 
years of many of our most experienced 
diplomats, and the lack of account-
ability for the political leadership at 
the top during the last 4 years. Mr. 
Blinken’s experience and expertise is 
necessary to begin to repair the dam-
age and rebuild the State Department. 
Moreover, the Office of Secretary of 
State is fourth in the Presidential line 
of succession and is one of the most im-
portant national security positions in 
the government. To paraphrase former 
Secretary of Defense James Mattis, if 
we do not support diplomacy, our 
Armed Forces will ultimately need 
more ammunition. He was right. Ro-
bust diplomacy means that we are less 
likely to have to send our sons and 
daughters to fight wars, and it means 
more opportunities for Americans and 
American businesses abroad. 
I strongly support Mr. Blinken’s 
nomination today because he is the 
right person for the job and because we 
cannot afford to leave this post vacant 
any longer. I hope my colleagues will 
all join me. 
With that, I yield the floor.

f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this im-
peachment is nothing more than a par-
tisan exercise designed to further di-
vide the country. Democrats claim to 
want to unify the country, but im-
peaching a former President, a private 
citizen, is the antithesis of unity. 
Democrats brazenly appointing a pro- 
impeachment Democrat to preside over 
the trial is not fair or impartial and 
hardly encourages any kind of unity in 
our country. No, unity is the opposite 
of this travesty we are about to wit-
ness. 
If we are about to try to impeach a 
President, where is the Chief Justice? 
If the accused is no longer President, 
where is the constitutional power to 
impeach him? 
Private citizens don’t get impeached. 
Impeachment is for removal from of-
fice, and the accused here has already 
left office. 
Hyperpartisan Democrats are about 
to drag our great country down into 
the gutter of rancor and vitriol, the 
likes of which has never been seen in 
our Nation’s history. 
Instead of doing the Nation’s work, 
with their new majorities in the House, 
the Senate, and the executive branch, 
Democrats are wasting the Nation’s 
time on a partisan vendetta against a 
man no longer in office. It is almost as 
if they have no ability to exist except 
in opposition to Donald Trump. With-
out him as their boogeyman, they 
might have to legislate and to actually 
convince Americans that their policy 
prescriptions are the right ones. 
Democrats are about to do something 
no self-respecting Senator has ever 
stooped to. Democrats are insisting the 
election is actually not over, and so 
they insist on regurgitating the bitter-
ness of the election. 
This acrimony they are about to un-
leash has never before been tried. Why? 
Because calmer heads have typically 
prevailed in our history and allowed 
public opinion to cast blame where 
blame is deserved. 
This sham of an impeachment will 
ostensibly ask whether the President 
incited the reprehensible behavior and 
violence of January 6, when he said: ‘‘I 
know everyone here will soon march to 
the Capitol to peacefully and patrioti-
cally make your voices heard.’’ 
‘‘Peacefully 
and 
patriotically’’— 
hardly words of violence. 
But what of Democrat words? What 
of Democrat incitement to violence? 
No 
Democrat 
will 
honestly 
ask 
whether BERNIE SANDERS incited the

January 26, 2021 
shooter that nearly killed STEVE SCA-
LISE and a volunteer coach. The shoot-
er nearly pulled off a massacre—I was 
there—because he fervently believed 
the false and inflammatory rhetoric 
spewed by BERNIE
and other Demo-
crats, 
such 
as: 
‘‘The 
Republican 
healthcare plan for the uninsured is 
that you die.’’ 
As this avowed BERNIE supporter shot 
STEVE SCALISE, nearly killing him, and 
shot one of our coaches and two or 
three of our staff, he screamed: ‘‘This 
is for healthcare!’’ 
Ask me or anyone if that is incite-
ment. 
No Democrat will ask whether CORY 
BOOKER incited violence when he called 
for his supporters to get ‘‘up in the face 
of Congress people’’—a very visual and 
specific incitement. 
No Democrat will ask whether MAX-
INE WATERS incited violence when she 
literally told her supporters: ‘‘If you 
see a member of the Trump [adminis-
tration] at a restaurant, [at] a depart-
ment store, [at] a gas station, or any 
place, you create a crowd and you push 
back on them.’’ Is that not incitement? 
My wife and I were pushed and sur-
rounded and screamed at by this same 
type of mob that MAXINE likes to in-
spire. It is terrifying to have a swarm 
of people threatening to kill you, curs-
ing at you, and literally holding you 
hostage until police come to your res-
cue. That night we were assaulted by 
the crowd, I wasn’t sure if we would 
survive even with the police protec-
tion. But no Democrat has ever consid-
ered impeaching MAXINE for her violent 
rhetoric. In fact, Republicans, to our 
credit, have never once thought it le-
gitimate to censure or impeach these 
Democrats. 
No Republican has sought to use a 
government to hold these Democrats 
responsible for Antifa and Black Lives 
Matter violence that has consumed our 
cities all summer, resulting in over $1 
billion of destruction, looting, and 
property damage. Not one Republican 
said, ‘‘Oh, let’s impeach the Democrats 
who are inciting this’’ because it would 
be ridiculous. 
Many on the Democrat side of the 
aisle cheered them on. KAMALA HARRIS 
famously offered to pay the bill for 
those who were arrested. I wonder if 
she will be brought up on charges of in-
citing violence for that now that she is 
Vice President. Should KAMALA HARRIS 
be impeached for offering to pay for 
violent people to get out of jail who 
have been burning our cities down? No. 
No Republican has offered that because 
we are not going down the road the 
Democrats have decided, this low road 
of impeaching people for political 
speech. 
Should 
Republicans 
impeach 
the 
Democratic mayor of Seattle who in-
cited and condoned violence by calling 
the armed takeover of part of her city 
‘‘a summer of love’’? Did any Repub-
licans try to impeach her? 
Then on June 8, the New York Post, 
citing U.S. Justice Department statis-
tics, reported that more than 700 law 
enforcement officers were injured dur-
ing the Antifa-Black Lives Matter 
riots. There were at least 19 murders, 
including 77-year-old retired police of-
ficer David Dorn. Yet Democrats insist 
on applying a test of incitement to a 
Republican that they refuse to apply to 
themselves. 
I want the Democrats to raise their 
hands if they have ever given a speech 
that says ‘‘Take back; fight for your 
country.’’ Who hasn’t used the word 
‘‘fight’’ figuratively? And are we going 
to put every politician in jail? Are we 
going to impeach every politician who 
has used the word ‘‘fight’’ figuratively 
in a speech? 
Shame. Shame on these angry, un-
hinged partisans who are putting forth 
this sham impeachment, deranged by 
their hatred of the former President. 
Shame on those who seek blame and 
revenge and who choose to pervert a 
constitutional process while doing so. 
I want this body on record, every last 
person here: Is this how you think poli-
tics should be? 
Look, we have now got crazy par-
tisans on the other side of the aisle 
trying to censor and remove two of the 
Republican Senators for their political 
position. Look, I disagreed. I don’t 
think Congress should overturn the 
electoral college. But impeaching or 
censoring or expelling a Member of 
Congress you disagree with—is the 
truth so narrow that only you know 
the truth? We now have the media on 
your side saying there is only one set 
of facts, one set of truths, and you can 
only interpret it this way. 
Now we have seven Senators on the 
other side trying to expel, censor, or 
impugn two Senators on this side. I de-
fend them, not because I defend their 
position—I disagreed with their posi-
tion—but you can’t impeach, censor, or 
expel people you disagree with. What is 
this coming to? 
In a few minutes, I will insist on a 
vote to affirm that this proceeding we 
are about to enter is unconstitutional, 
that impeachment of a private citizen 
is illegal and essentially a bill of at-
tainder, and that no sense of fairness 
or due process would allow the judge in 
the proceeding to be a partisan Demo-
crat already in favor of the impeach-
ment. 
A sham this is. A travesty. A dark 
blot on the history of our country. I 
urge my colleagues to reconsider this 
kangaroo court and move forward to 
debate the great issues of our day. 
With that, I would like to relinquish 
the last moment or two of my time to 
the Senator of Wisconsin. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. 
JOHNSON. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
would like to first thank my colleague 
from Kentucky for his consistent, over 
the years—consistent fighting, I use 
that word—fighting for the Constitu-
tion. I truly appreciate it, and I appre-
ciate his raising this constitutional 
point of order in an hour or so. 
The issue he raises is one of constitu-
tionality versus unconstitutionality. I 
have been reading positions on both 
sides. I understand there are legitimate 
arguments on both sides of that ques-
tion. But the fact is, 3 weeks ago, we 
came together in this body and we col-
lectively decided that it was not wise, 
it was not smart—regardless of the 
constitutionality or the ability for us 
to do so, it was not smart for Congress 
to overrule, overturn the wishes of vot-
ers and of States that certified the 
electors. We felt that was not wise. 
Again, in a couple of hours, we are 
going to be voting on—we won’t be able 
to debate, which is why I am rising 
today or at this moment—we are going 
to debate whether a trial of someone 
who is no longer a President, no longer 
a civil servant, a private citizen, 
whether that is constitutional or not 
constitutional. Again, there are good 
arguments on both sides. Senators will 
vote differently and have justification 
for whatever side of that argument 
they take. 
What I would like my colleagues to 
consider when they decide how to vote 
on that is not the constitutionality or 
unconstitutionality of that; I want 
them to consider, is it wise? Will a 
trial of a former President, of a private 
citizen—will it heal? Will it unify? I 
think the answer is clearly it will not. 
A trial of a former President is simply 
vindictive. It will divide. It is like 
opening up a wound and throwing salt 
in it. That is not a healing process. 
Again, the question when we vote on 
this in a couple of hours, for every Sen-
ator, should be, Is it wise? Is it the 
right thing to do? I think from that 
standpoint, the choice is very clear: It 
will not heal. It will not unite. 
Let’s put an end to this now. Let’s 
dismiss this trial and rule it unconsti-
tutional. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate stands 
in recess until 2:15 p.m.

TRIAL OF DONALD JOHN TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A 
quorum is present. 
Under the previous order, the hour of 
2:30 p.m. having arrived and a quorum 
having been established, the Senate 
will proceed to consideration of the Ar-
ticle of Impeachment against Donald 
John Trump, the former President of 
the United States. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, at 
this time, pursuant to rule IV of the 
Senate Rules on Impeachment and the 
U.S. Constitution, the President pro 
tempore emeritus, the Senator from 
Iowa, will now administer the oath to 
the President pro tempore, PATRICK J. 
LEAHY. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Please raise your 
right hand. Your hand is on the Bible. 
Do you solemnly swear that in all 
things appertaining to the trial of the 
impeachment of Donald John Trump, 
former President of the United States, 
now pending, that you will do impar-
tial justice according to the Constitu-
tion and the laws, so help you God? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I do, 
so help me God. 
At this time I will administer the 
oath to all Senators in the Chamber in 
conformance with article I, section 3, 
clause 6 of the Constitution and the 
Senate impeachment rules. 
Will all Senators now rise and raise 
their right hands. 
Do you solemnly swear that in all 
things appertaining to the trial of the 
impeachment of Donald John Trump, 
former President of the United States, 
now pending, you will do impartial jus-
tice according to the Constitution and 
laws, so help you God? 
SENATORS. I do. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the names in groups of 
four. The Senators will present them-
selves at the desk to sign the Oath 
Book. 
The legislative clerk called the roll, 
and the Senators present answered ‘‘I 
do’’ and signed the Official Oath Book. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Acting Sergeant at Arms will make the 
proclamation. 
The Acting Sergeant at Arms, Jen-
nifer Hemingway, made the proclama-
tion as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All per-
sons are commanded to keep silent, on 
pain of imprisonment, while the House 
of Representatives is exhibiting to the 
Senate of the United States the Article 
of Impeachment against Donald John 
Trump, former President of the United 
States. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, article II, 
section 4 of the Constitution says: 
‘‘The President, Vice President and all 
civil Officers of the United States, 
shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, 
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors.’’ 
Article I, section 3, clause 6 states: 
‘‘When the President of the United 
States is tried, the Chief Justice shall 
preside.’’ 
As of noon last Wednesday, Donald 
Trump holds none of the positions list-
ed in the Constitution. He is a private 
citizen. The Presiding Officer is not the 
Chief Justice, nor does he claim to be. 
His presence in the Chief Justice’s ab-
sence demonstrates that this is not a 
trial of the President but of a private 
citizen. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Therefore, I make a point of order 
that this proceeding, which would try a 
private citizen and not a President, a 
Vice President, or civil officer, violates 
the Constitution and is not in order. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the precedents of the Senate regarding 
constitutional points of order, includ-
ing those of the Senate while sitting as 
a Court of Impeachment, the Chair sub-
mits the question to the Senate: Is the 
point of order well taken? 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
theory that the impeachment of a 
former official is unconstitutional is 
flat-out wrong by every frame of anal-
ysis: constitutional text, historical 
practice, precedent, and basic common 
sense. It has been completely debunked 
by constitutional scholars from all 
across the political spectrum. 
Now, the junior Senator from Ken-
tucky read one clause from the Con-
stitution about the Senate’s impeach-
ment powers. He left out another from 
article I, section 3: ‘‘Judgment in Cases 
of Impeachment shall not extend fur-
ther than to removal from Office, and 
disqualification to hold and enjoy any 
Office of honor, Trust or Profit under 
the United States. 
If the Framers intended impeach-
ment to merely be a vehicle to remove 
sitting officials from their office, they 
would not have included that addi-
tional provision: disqualification from 
future office. The Constitution also 
gives the Senate the ‘‘sole power’’ to 
try all impeachments. 
So what did past Senates decide on 
this 
question? 
In 
1876, 
President 
Grant’s Secretary of War, William 
Belknap, literally raced to the White 
House to tender his resignation before 
the House was set to vote on his im-
peachment. Not only did the House 
move forward with the impeachment, 
but the Senate convened a trial and 
voted as a Chamber that Mr. Belknap 
could be tried ‘‘for acts done as Sec-
retary of War, notwithstanding his res-
ignation of said office.’’ 
The language is crystal clear, with-
out any ambiguity. The history and 
precedent is clear. The Senate has the 
power to try former officials, and the 
reasons for that are basic common 
sense. It makes no sense whatsoever 
that a President or any official could 
commit a heinous crime against our 
country and then defeat Congress’s im-
peachment powers and avoid disquali-
fication by simply resigning or by 
waiting to commit that offense until 
their last few weeks in office. 
The theory that the Senate can’t try 
former officials would amount to a 
constitutional get-out-of-jail-free card 
for any President who commits an im-
peachable offense. 
Ironically, the Senator from Ken-
tucky’s motion would do an injury to 
the Constitution by rendering the dis-
qualification clause effectively moot. 
So, 
again, 
by 
constitutional 
text, 
precedent, and common basic sense, it 
is clearly and certainly constitutional 
to hold a trial for a former official. 
Former President Trump committed, 
in the view of many, including myself, 
the gravest offense ever committed by 
a President of the United States. 
The Senate will conduct a trial of the 
former President, and Senators will 
render judgment on his conduct. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Therefore, the point of order is ill- 
founded and, in any case, premature. If 
Senators want this issue debated, it 
can and will be argued during the trial. 
Therefore, I move to table the point of 
order, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

f 
MORNING BUSINESS—Continued 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Mr. 
President, 
throughout the Presidential campaign, 
President Biden spoke often about the 
need to unify the country. He talked 
about the need for people across our 
great Nation to come together to 
empathize with one another and to 
mend the divisions that exist in our so-
ciety. He echoed that same theme in 
his inaugural address, saying: 
Without unity, there is no peace, only bit-
terness and fury. No progress, only exhaust-
ing outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. 
I agree with President Biden that 
there is an imperative to restore unity 
and civility throughout our country, 
but for all of the talk of uniting, com-
promising, and working together, the 
early pages of this new chapter read 
quite differently. 
For starters, there are the actions of 
our Democratic colleagues who are try-
ing to eliminate the legislative fili-
buster. They have echoed and praised 
the President’s call for unity and bi-
partisanship while threatening to tear 
down the very rules that force us to 
work together in a bipartisan way. We 
know that the filibuster, or the cloture 
requirement that requires 60 votes to 
close off debate, is designed to encour-
age a fulsome debate of the issues that 
confront 330 million Americans. It is 
what distinguishes the Senate from 
other legislative bodies. Unlike in the 
House of Representatives, where you 
need a simple majority in order to 
work your will, the Senate requires 60 
votes to be in agreement in order to 
close off debate before a bill can be 
passed with 51 votes or more. It really 
forces us to do what sometimes we re-
sist, which is to work together in a bi-
partisan way. The American people 
may believe that it is in our best inter-
est for us to pass things on a partisan 
basis, but it is certainly not in their 
best interest. So the cloture require-
ment, or the filibuster rule, is designed 
to prevent either party from steam-
rolling the other, and that is a good 
thing. 
The new majority leader, the Senator 
from New York, has threatened to blow 
up the filibuster and clear a path for a 
sweeping, radical agenda—this despite 
the fact that our Democratic friends 
have themselves relied on the filibuster 
over the last 6 years as the minority 
party and that President Biden him-
self, based on his 36 years of experience 
in the U.S. Senate, has affirmed the 
importance of this 60-vote requirement. 
I am glad that two of our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle—one from 
West Virginia and one from Arizona— 
have offered their assurances that they 
will not vote to end the legislative fili-
buster, but I am disappointed that only 
two of our Democratic colleagues have 
done that. This should not be con-
troversial or newsworthy to begin 
with. So far, the majority of Senate 
Democrats has made no legitimate ef-
fort to pursue President Biden’s call 
for unity or bipartisanship. 
Unfortunately, it is not just the ac-
tions of our Democratic colleagues 
which have caused concern. President 
Biden himself has acted unilaterally, 
time and again, by issuing a lengthy 
list of Executive orders within hours of 
his inauguration. The policies that 
President Biden is addressing in his Ex-
ecutive orders should be addressed here 
in Congress with bipartisan legislation. 
One of those was a 100-day moratorium 
on enforcing bipartisan immigration 
laws, which was enjoined by a Federal 
judge in my State earlier today. 
It would be better for the country if 
our Democratic colleagues tried to leg-
islate instead of litigate these Execu-
tive orders in court. I think the experi-
ence with DACA, or the experience 
with the Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals, 
is 
instructive. 
President 
Obama, back in 2012, decided to take it 
upon himself to enact this new policy. 
It has been tied up in the courts for the 
ensuing 8, now going on 9 years. I sup-
port providing a permanent solution 
for DACA recipients, but it has to be 
done here on a bipartisan basis, not 
just ordered unilaterally from the Oval 
Office, or else we are going to see these 
bogged down in lawsuit, after lawsuit, 
after lawsuit, which, I think, will be 
satisfying to virtually no one.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S144 
January 26, 2021 
On top of the DACA Program, Presi-
dent Biden has now been piling on addi-
tional 
immigration-related 
actions, 
and he is expected to issue more in the 
coming days, but some of the most ag-
gressive and controversial moves we 
have seen so far have related to energy 
policy. Within hours of the inaugura-
tion, President Biden canceled the per-
mit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
There is no question that one of the 
biggest losers from that decision is the 
energy worker who stood to benefit 
from the jobs being created by the 
pipeline construction, and lest anybody 
think this is going to stop the flow of 
oil from Canada to the United States, 
what is going to happen—and what pre-
viously happened—is that oil will be 
loaded into railroad car tankers and 
trucks and shipped to their destina-
tions. So it is not really stopping the 
oil from flowing where it is needed for 
low-cost and reasonably cost energy. It 
is just providing a more expensive and, 
indeed, a more dangerous alternative. 
At a time when our energy industry is 
already suffering as a result of the pan-
demic, this project would have led to a 
positive, cascading economic impact. 
Good-paying jobs, tax revenues, and 
economic benefits to local commu-
nities will evaporate because of this 
move. 
I would note that, in the Rio Grande 
Valley, right along the U.S. Texas bor-
der with Mexico, that President Trump 
performed surprisingly well among His-
panic voters. People wrongly assume 
that Hispanic voters only care about 
immigration laws. The truth is they 
care about jobs and their families and 
their ability to pursue the American 
dream, which is why they overper-
formed what they typically would and 
why President Biden underperformed 
what he typically would in a largely 
Democratic stronghold there in the Rio 
Grande Valley, but the buck doesn’t 
stop there. 
The same day, the Biden administra-
tion halted all new leasing permits on 
Federal lands and waters. Rather than 
harvest our natural resources, which is 
one of the greatest benefits that nature 
has conferred on our country, it ap-
pears the Biden administration is car-
rying out its campaign to transition 
from 
oil 
and 
gas. 
I 
am 
all 
for 
transitioning to cleaner forms of en-
ergy, but we have to deal with the re-
ality—for example, the fact that there 
are 280 million cars with internal com-
bustion engines on our roads. How are 
families going to get to work, take 
their kids to school or live their lives 
if, all of a sudden, the very natural re-
sources they depend on for their cars is 
no longer available? 
This 
industry, 
according 
to 
one 
study, directly or indirectly supports 
one in six jobs in my State and is a pil-
lar of our State’s economy. Through 
higher tax revenue, high-paying jobs, 
and downstream economic gains, com-
munities across my State reap the ben-
efits of our thriving oil and gas indus-
try every day. It is also what happens 
to finance higher education in Texas 
from a dedicated, permanent univer-
sity fund. If, in fact, our ability to 
produce this oil and gas from the 
ground is going to be curtailed, that is 
going to have dramatic, unintended 
consequences, too. 
This also makes sure that folks 
across the country who don’t produce 
this energy can get access to affordable 
and reliable energy. In November of 
2019, for the first time on record, the 
United States exported more crude oil 
and fuel than we imported; that is, 
rather than being dependent on other 
countries, we exported more than we 
imported. 
Beyond the obvious economic bene-
fits, this provides a serious boost to 
our national security and that of our 
allies. There is a reason we have been 
engaged in the Middle East for a long 
time. Ever since Winston Churchill, as 
the Lord of the Navy in Britain, de-
cided to move from coal to oil to power 
the British Navy, we have been depend-
ent on sources of oil and gas primarily 
from the Middle East. So this has not 
only economic consequences; it also 
has national security consequences. 
It also allows us to provide our 
friends and allies around the world 
with a dependable alternative. They no 
longer have to rely solely on the tender 
mercies of Vladimir Putin, for exam-
ple, for their energy supplies, which 
can, obviously, be used as a weapon in 
and of itself. All of these gains are pos-
sible because of the hard-working men 
and women who work in the field and 
in the refineries in energy-producing 
States like Texas. 
While COVID–19 has had an impact 
on American energy producers because 
demand has dropped precipitously, we 
don’t expect that downtick to last for-
ever. Indeed, it is coming back already 
as the economy continues to open up 
and now that more and more people are 
being vaccinated for COVID–19. We 
have hope that, later this year, people 
will resume their daily commutes to 
work; that the lights in their office 
buildings will flicker back on; that 
nonessential travel will pick back up; 
and that energy producers will be run-
ning at full speed once again. 
Rather than laying the foundation 
for a strong recovery, the Biden admin-
istration is issuing Executive orders 
that will harm American energy and 
send more business to our inter-
national competitors. 
And the administration is carrying 
out these changes without any input 
from Congress. 
I understand the President’s desire to 
bolster renewable energy, and I think 
he would find that if he explored en-
ergy policies with us in Congress, he 
would meet more friends than foes. 
I support the effort to drive down 
emissions, and, in fact, natural gas 
that transitions from coal-fired power-
plants to natural gas has been a big 
driver of the progress we have made in 
doing just that. But we shouldn’t stop 
there. We need to continue to invest in 
new clean energy technologies that 
will reduce emissions while providing 
low-cost access to electricity that the 
American people need to live and to 
work. 
The United States’ energy-related 
emissions dropped by almost 3 percent 
in 2019, largely due to the use of nat-
ural gas for power generation. 
But I am a strong supporter of renew-
able energy too. We truly, in my State, 
believe in an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
policy. We are the No. 1 producer of 
electricity from wind turbines in the 
country. We produce one-quarter of all 
wind energy in the United States, and 
if Texas were a country, we would be 
the fifth largest wind energy producer 
in the world. 
But even the strongest supporters of 
renewable sources of energy can tell 
you that, right now, renewables alone 
are not feasible to fuel our economy. 
After all, there are some times when 
the Sun doesn’t shine and when the 
wind doesn’t blow, so we need a backup 
or baseload source of energy. 
Last year, renewables accounted for 
less than 18 percent of our total elec-
tricity generation, and I am all for 
having that number grow. For com-
parison, natural gas, though, currently 
accounts for double that. 
While the development and expansion 
of renewable sources like wind energy 
are important, we can’t shut out our 
key sources of energy that we need 
today. We have been supporters of an 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy strategy, like 
I said. My State, I think, is proof posi-
tive that you can support the oil and 
gas energy that is so important for our 
economy and for people’s livelihoods; 
you can support renewables; and you 
can support innovative technologies 
that lower emissions, all while creating 
high-paying jobs and providing afford-
able and reliable energy. 
I would like to work with the admin-
istration and our Democratic col-
leagues in the Senate, as I have in the 
past, to enact lasting policies and de-
liver reliable energy to the American 
people and our friends and allies 
around the world while prioritizing 
conservation. 
This is not the time to implement 
unilateral, heavyhanded, shortsighted 
regulations. Our energy industry is 
still reeling from the effects of the pan-
demic, and the administration and 
Congress need to take action to sup-
port its recovery, not stand in its way. 
I agree with President Biden’s call 
for unity, and I hope that the next 4 
years will be filled with more bipar-
tisan cooperation than the first days of 
this new administration have been. 
We have learned, time and time 
again, that the legislative process, 
which forces us to work together in a 
consensus-building exercise is far more 
durable—far 
better—than 
unilateral 
Executive actions. I admit that both 
parties, when they are in the White 
House, have used Executive actions, 
but, frankly, I would think as an insti-
tution, we here in Congress would be

leery of encouraging more Executive

I encourage the administration to

gether for our shared priorities and 
create real and lasting change for our 
country.

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

f 
RECOGNIZING UTAH NATIONAL 
GUARD 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, some of our 
Nation’s finest answered the call of 
duty here in our Nation’s Capitol over 
the last 2 weeks to assist with the 
peaceful transition of power and make 
sure that it was in fact peaceful. These 
dedicated men and women in the Na-
tional Guard have taken an oath to 
protect that bedrock document, the 
Constitution of the United States, and, 
indeed, they have fulfilled that duty. 
Some of our very finest in the Na-
tional Guard came here to serve from 
my home State of Utah; 321 troops that 
have discharged their duties with dis-
tinction and honor came from the Utah 
National Guard. 
The majority of Task Force Utah 
consisted of soldiers from the 2nd Bat-
talion, 222nd Field Artillery, 65th Fires 
Brigade, also known as Triple Deuce. 
Additional soldiers came from 204th 
Maneuver Enhancement Brigade and 
the 19th Special Forces Group (Air-
borne). 
I rise today to honor and thank these 
really selfless women and men. These 
past weeks, the Utah guardsmen were 
stationed at the Madison Building of 
the Library of Congress, just across the 
street from the Capitol. For many of 
these soldiers, it was their first time 
ever visiting Washington, D.C. 
Major Brent Mangum of the Utah Na-
tional Guard remarked that as the sol-
diers were stationed at buildings, they 
saw these quotes on the walls—quotes 
from our Founding Fathers—and as 
they were working in these buildings, 
you could see them pausing during the 
day, reading the quotes, and then stop-
ping to reflect on them. 
I, myself, had the great privilege, in 
a couple of different groups, to give 
some of these men and women a tour of 
the Capitol Building before they left to 
go back to Utah. It was a great honor 
to meet and get to know these dedi-
cated guardsmen and to learn from 
their stories and to see firsthand their 
caliber as people and, most impor-
tantly perhaps, their visible commit-
ment to the United States of America. 
This idea, this principle, in this great 
land of ours—the greatest civilization 
human history has ever known—was 
something that they are independently 
committed 
to 
defending 
and 
pro-
tecting, even at the sacrifice of their 
own security and their own ease, which 
they would have otherwise enjoyed 
over the last couple of weeks. 
One of the most remarkable things 
about these citizen soldiers is the way 
in which they tirelessly serve their 
communities, and I say that meaning 
both inside and outside of their Guard 
duty. 
My Salt Lake City office was lucky 
enough to have one of these fine young 
soldiers, Alfredo Lopez, as an intern a 
few years ago. 
Alfredo immigrated with his family 
from Peru at the age of 10, and they 
began to build a life here in the United 
States. In addition to serving the peo-
ple of Utah in my State office, he also 
was on Active Duty with the Marine 
Corps before he joined the National 
Guard. Alfredo, in all of his endeavors 
in our country, has sought only to give 
back. He is grateful for this country 
and wants to make sure it is a strong, 
safe, and secure place in which to live. 
Another guardsman who was here, 
Jay Bartholomew, is a prison guard at 
the Gunnison prison in Sanpete Coun-
ty, UT. He is the son of my friend Scott 
Bartholomew, a county commissioner 
in Sanpete County. Jay has followed in 
his family’s footsteps to serve his local 
community. 
Other guardsmen in Utah are en-
gaged in their communities in all sorts 
of ways. Some are teachers, some are 
firefighters, some are policemen, and 
some are medical professionals. You 
name it; they have done it. 
Many have now answered the call of 
duty on the frontlines of another crisis 
as our Nation faces the current pan-
demic. These guardsmen have played a 
significant role in providing testing, 
moving and storing personal protective 
equipment, and other support missions 
to assist Utah’s Department of Health 
COVID–19 response. 
Now, Utah Governor Spencer Cox has 
entrusted them with another critical 
mission. The Guard will be on the 
frontlines to help ramp up the delivery 
of vaccines to our State. The Guard has 
put together teams that can mobilize 
throughout Utah to deliver vaccina-
tions and antibody infusions within a 
matter of hours and save a whole lot of 
lives and prevent a whole lot of suf-
fering in the process. 
I have no doubt that they will con-
tinue to administer this duty with 
dedication and with excellence, just as 
they do with every other assignment 
with which they are tasked. In every-
thing they do, members of the Utah 
National Guard seek to serve and 
strengthen our communities, our coun-
try, and our State, and we are all bet-
ter off for it. 
It has been such an honor to have 
these selfless men and women in our 
Nation’s Capitol. I have enjoyed get-
ting to know them and look forward to 
visiting again with them soon, and I 
thank them for their service. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. LEE. Now, Mr. President, I would 
like to discuss another important mat-
ter. This past week, we marked the an-
niversary of a deadly day in American 
history. It has resulted in the loss of 
millions of innocent American lives. 
That is the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. 
Since January 22, 1973, more than 60 
million unborn children have been lost 
to the scourge of abortion. This week, 
we honor and remember those lives, as 
well as those who have been hurt by 
the pains of abortion. 
In a normal year, tens of thousands 
of Americans would be marching down 
Constitution Avenue this Friday to do 
so. This year, as with so many other 
things, the March for Life will instead 
be virtual. But, nonetheless, Americans 
will continue to march, whether vir-
tually or in person where they can. 
The theme of this year’s march is 
‘‘Together Strong: Life Unites!’’—a fit-
ting theme following a year ripe with 
division, violence, and loss. Now, more 
than ever, we must unite as a nation, 
turning with hope toward the future— 
hope that our Nation will heal, hope 
that justice will prevail, and hope that 
the grievous act of abortion will be for-
saken. Given our country’s history, in 
which we have stubbornly made mis-
takes 
but, 
thankfully, 
have 
come 
around in the end, there is much rea-
son for hope. But we cannot heal and 
we cannot unite if we don’t honor and 
respect all of the American people, 
born and unborn. 
So many of the deepest injustices in 
our country’s history stem from one 
dark dangerous thing; that is, when we 
have rejected the dignity of the human 
person, when we have denied the hu-
manity of our brothers and sisters, 
when we have discriminated against 
others based on the way they look, 
think, love, or worship, and when, be-
cause of that, we have looked at them 
not as people but as things and as mere 
objects to be acted upon. 
As abolitionist William Lord Garri-
son put it, the worst kind of oppression 
to be regarded with the greatest degree 
of indignation and abhorrence is ‘‘that 
which turns a man into a thing.’’ 
Now, we have discriminated against a 
whole class of people not based on the 
color of their skin but on their age and 
development. 
But it doesn’t change the truth. The 
truth is that a baby inside the womb 
can respond to human touch by the age 
of 8 weeks and feel pain by the age of 
20 weeks—who can recognize her moth-
er’s voice even before she is born; who 
has a perfect little nose, fingernails, 
and a beating, fully functioning heart, 
her own distinct unique DNA, and her 
own unique unrepeatable soul. 
Science and medicine are only con-
firming what we know deep down, that 
unborn human beings are in fact little

January 26, 2021 
persons. The evidence is only getting 
plainer by the day. 
When we deny the humanity of our 
brothers and sisters, as we have seen 
throughout our history and over the 
past year, the inevitable and tragic re-
sult is violence. Abortion does undeni-
able violence to the baby and undeni-
able violence to the mother. Thank-
fully, looking back at the past decade, 
we have made significant strides to-
ward building a culture that respects, 
values, and even protects all human 
life, even in its simplest, earliest 
stages of development. 
Many States have ensured that pub-
lic funds are directed toward pregnancy 
health centers, rather than abortion fa-
cilities, providing life-affirming alter-
natives to families in need. And in just 
the last decade alone, States have 
passed more than 400 pro-life laws— 
more than one-third of all pro-life laws 
that States have passed since Roe v. 
Wade was decided. This is indeed rea-
son for hope. 
Through our laws and with our lives, 
we ought to affirm the truth that the 
lives of both the mother and the baby 
matter and that healthcare should 
heal, protect, and preserve both of 
those lives. 
I have introduced legislation to help 
our 
laws 
affirm 
that 
very 
truth. 
Through my bill, the Abortion Is Not 
Healthcare Act, we have a chance to 
stop the tax deductibility of abortions, 
which are currently categorized as 
‘‘medical care’’ by the IRS, because we 
must be serious: Whatever else it may 
be, of course, elective abortion is not 
healthcare. That is why physicians lit-
erally take an oath to do no harm. The 
government should not offer tax bene-
fits for a procedure that kills hundreds 
of thousands of unborn children each 
and every year. 
We also have the chance to pre-
maturely stop the use of American for-
eign aid—the opportunity permanently 
to stop the use of American foreign 
aid—from funding or promoting abor-
tions overseas and perpetuating vio-
lence against women and of children 
abroad, especially baby girls. 
The Protecting Life in Foreign As-
sistance Act will save countless lives 
across the globe, and it affirms the 
truth that the lives of all unborn chil-
dren, regardless of where they are 
from, have dignity and worth. 
As the lyrics of a children’s song in 
my church—a song that I sang in Sun-
day school as a child—say about each 
one of us, I am a child of God. We are 
all one human family, all children of 
God—these littlest among us, too, who 
cannot yet sing for themselves, but 
they will soon. They will soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, in 
the 2020 elections, Americans chose an 
evenly-divided 
Senate—half 
Repub-
lican, half Democrat. Evenly divided. 
Since the Vice President is able to 
break a tie when it comes to specifi-
cally organizing the Senate, Democrats 
have the majority. 
Now some Democrats want to lower 
the threshold for all the votes so that 
to pass anything, all they would need 
to do in case of a tie vote would have 
the Vice President be the tiebreaker. 
That is the way that a majority works. 
When there is a tie and the Vice Presi-
dent is in one party, they get to break 
the tie in that direction, of course. 
What we need to make sure of, 
though, is that there is fairness in the 
process. The traditions and how this 
institution works are that we have a 
filibuster. Sixty votes is how legisla-
tion is passed. 
We know that the press and some-
times folks in Congress say it is hard 
to pass a law. Well, it is not supposed 
to be easy. It takes discussion. It takes 
negotiation. It brings people together. 
That is the idea of needing 60 votes—to 
bring people together to get a bipar-
tisan consensus so that all the voices 
are heard; that there is a majority, and 
the minority voice is heard, and it 
forces us to find common ground. 
Frankly, I think there is too little of 
finding common ground in Washington 
already. The last thing America needs 
is even more divisiveness. This is a big, 
diverse country. We don’t need 50 per-
cent of the country plus one to run 
roughshod over all the others. That is 
why our Founders were so careful to 
protect the rights of the minority. 
That is why they created the Bill of 
Rights, why they created the electoral 
college, and why they created the U.S. 
Senate. The Founding Fathers didn’t 
want the Senate to be a copy of the 
House. We are intended to be a check 
on the House. 
There is a story that President Wash-
ington compared the Senate to a sau-
cer used to cool down a cup of tea. 
President Madison compared it to a 
fence. We are not supposed to be a 
smaller version of the House of Rep-
resentatives. The Senate is supposed to 
cool things down. We are supposed to 
think things through. We are supposed 
to stop bad ideas and stop the House 
from moving too fast. Changing the 
rules of the Senate would make that 
impossible. 
Lowering the bar to 50 votes could 
also be a blatant power grab, which is 
50 votes and the Vice President. The 
Democrats could even add States to 
the Union—specifically States that 
would elect more Democrats to the 
Senate. It would give them even more 
Senate seats, could even give them a 
permanent majority in the Senate. 
With 50 votes plus the Vice Presi-
dent, Democrats could also pack the 
Supreme Court with liberal activist 
judges—judges who legislate from the 
bench, not judges who apply the law as 
written. That would give them a per-
manent majority both in the Senate 
and on the Court. 
With a single rule change, one branch 
of government, one Chamber of Con-
gress, could be under permanent Demo-
cratic control. It is no surprise that it 
is tempting to Senate Democrats and 
that the far-left branch of that party is 
demanding that occur. 
You remember that when President 
Trump was in office, Republicans had a 
chance to do exactly the same thing. In 
fact, former President Trump repeat-
edly asked us and told us that we 
should do just that. In one particularly 
memorable example, he tweeted: ‘‘The 
U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes.’’ 
He said: ‘‘Dems would do it, no doubt.’’ 
More than 30 different times, President 
Trump asked that Republicans end the 
filibuster. We didn’t. We stuck to the 
intentions of our Founding Fathers. We 
protected the rights of the minority, 
and we put country before party. 
If Democrats won’t stop the power 
grab for the good of the country, then 
they should at least do it for their own 
good. 
Democrats have had 50 votes and the 
Vice President for only a few days. In 
fact, when Democrats were in the mi-
nority, 33 Democratic Senators said 
they didn’t want to change the rules. 
They signed a letter, and that letter 
called for the preservation of the rights 
of the minority. Twenty-seven of those 
Democrats are still Members of the 
Senate today. One of those Democrats 
is now the Vice President of the United 
States, Vice President KAMALA HARRIS. 
Even President Biden called the idea 
of eliminating the filibuster ‘‘a very 
dangerous move.’’ The White House 
Press Secretary told us last week 
President Biden still opposes changing 
the rules. 
If Democrats go down this road and 
break the rules of the Senate, they are 
doing more than just hurting the insti-
tution; they are admitting their ideas 
don’t have broad bipartisan support. 
Think about that. If the Democratic 
agenda had the support of the Amer-
ican people, then they wouldn’t need to 
change the rules. If Democrats could 
find bipartisan support to pass their 
tax increases, they would leave the 
rules alone. If Democrats could find bi-
partisan support to pass the Green New 
Deal and higher energy costs that come 
with it, they would leave the rules 
alone. If they could restrict gun owner-
ship, they would leave the rules alone. 
They can’t, and they know they can’t. 
They know the American people have 
looked at their progressive agenda and 
said: No, thank you. 
President Biden’s inaugural address 
last week talked a lot about unity. He 
said that ‘‘with unity we can do great 
things.’’ I agree. 
I ask my Democratic colleagues if 
they agree with the President’s inau-
gural address, or do they really think

that they want to make the U.S. Sen-
ate more partisan, more divided. Do 
they really want to take power away 
from individual Senators and give it to 
whoever

50 
votes

for Democrats to pass laws, then they 
should try talking with us. Propose bi-

lenges. Persuade your colleagues. Make 
progress together. 
As my friend, former Senator Lamar 
Alexander, said in his farewell address 
just a month ago—he said: ‘‘We don’t 
need a change of rules. The Senate 
needs a change of behavior.’’ 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to 
reject this blatant power grab. Stop 
this rush to take more and more power. 
Come to the center. Reach across the 
aisle. Find common ground. 
Senate Republicans are ready to 
work together to help the American 
people, to get people back to work, to 
get our kids safely back to school so 
they don’t fall further behind, and to 
get the virus behind us. Join us. Let’s 
work together. Let’s do what is right 
for the people we serve. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO 
NICHOLAS MAYORKAS 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise 
to 
speak 
in 
support 
of 
Ali 
Mayorkas’s nomination to be Sec-
retary of Homeland Security. 
I believe Ali is uniquely qualified to 
face the challenges our Nation is facing 
on day one. He brings to this office a 
diverse background and set of experi-
ences in both the private and public 
sectors that will serve him well. 
I have known Ali for many years and 
am proud to have recommended him to 
President Clinton for the position of 
U.S. Attorney for the Central District 
of California. I also worked very close-
ly with Ali while he served as Presi-
dent Obama’s Director of U.S. Citizen-
ship and Immigration Services and 
later Deputy Secretary of DHS. 
We all know that the role of Sec-
retary of the Department of Homeland 
Security is challenging. Recent history 
has shown the threats facing the 
United States are diverse and ever- 
changing. 
Over my many years working with 
Ali, I have witnessed his intelligence, 
kindness, and thoughtfulness, as well 
as the compassion and morality he 
brings with him to work every day. In 
many ways, Ali’s life story reflects the 
spirit of the American dream, and I 
would like to briefly pass along some of 
that story today. 
Born in Havana, Cuba, Ali and his 
family fled to the United States in 1960. 
He attended the University of Cali-
fornia-Berkeley, where he earned a 
bachelor’s degree with distinction in 
1981. He went on to earn his law degree 
from Loyola Law School in 1985. From 
1989 to 1998, he served as an Assistant 
U.S. Attorney for the Central District 
of California where he prosecuted a 
wide array of Federal crimes. Ali be-
came the first U.S. Attorney in the 
Central District of California to be ap-
pointed from within the office when he 
was appointed in 1998. 
He created the Civil Rights Section 
in the office to prosecute hate crimes; 
he developed an innovative program to 
address violent crime by targeting 
criminals’ possession of firearms; he 
led the prosecution of street gangs; and 
he still had time to develop an after-
school program to help at-risk youth. 
Ali’s approach to enforcing our Na-
tion’s laws demonstrates a much-need-
ed holistic view that understands the 
complexity of the challenge. He further 
developed his sharp legal skills as a 
partner at O’Melveny and Myers from 
2001 to 2009 where he represented com-
panies in high-profile and sensitive 
government enforcement cases. He was 
recognized by his worldwide firm for 
his leadership and was named by the 
National Law Journal in 2008 as one of 
the ‘‘50 Most Influential Minority Law-
yers in America.’’ 
When Ali took over as Director of 
USCIS in 2009, he worked to administer 
our immigration laws while preserving 
our legacy as a nation of immigrants. 
He helped ensure integrity of our im-
migration laws by decreasing fraud and 
bringing accountability to our immi-
gration system. 
Significantly, 
under 
President 
Obama’s directive to grant deferred ac-
tion to immigrants who arrived in this 
country as children, Ali successfully 
implemented the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. 
This program played a critical role 
for hundreds of thousands of young 
people who were able to get jobs, ac-
quire driver’s licenses, purchase homes 
and go to college. I am proud that Ali 
will continue to play a role in allowing 
these young people to pursue the 
American dream. 
When Ali became the Deputy Sec-
retary of Homeland Security under 
President Obama in 2013, he took on 
even more responsibility. He led the 
DHS response to the Ebola and Zika 
virus epidemics, as well as cybersecu-
rity negotiations with China. 
He oversaw the agency’s complex ef-
forts to combat terrorism and enhance 
the security and management of our 
borders. He worked to facilitate trade 
and travel, and he oversaw the enforce-
ment of our immigration laws. 
And he was responsible for coordi-
nating efforts to safeguard cyberspace 
and oversee disaster coordination with 
Federal, State, local, international, 
and private sector partners. 
The United States faces new threats 
to our security every day. We need ex-
perienced, intelligent, and moral lead-
ership at DHS to combat those threats. 
I 
have 
full 
confidence 
that 
Ali 
Mayorkas will bring all of those quali-
ties to the role of Homeland Security 
Secretary. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote to confirm Alejandro 
Mayorkas for the position of Secretary 
of Homeland Security. 
Thank you. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF JANET LOUISE 
YELLEN 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I voted 
against the confirmation of Janet 
Yellen to be Treasury Secretary. Dr. 
Yellen is well known as an academic, 
as an economic policy adviser to Presi-
dent Clinton, and as Chair of the Fed-
eral Reserve. In all of these positions, 
she has proven herself to be wrong on 
fiscal, monetary, and economic policy. 
At her confirmation hearing, she vig-
orously supported the additional $2 
trillion stimulus package President 
Biden has put forward. Her argument is 
that this time is different—but since 
the great recession, big spenders have 
not receded from that argument, even 
during the times of unprecedented 
spending growth in the Trump adminis-
tration. Moreover, we know what the 
problem is in our economy today: gov-
ernment-mandated business closures. 
The economy contracted by nearly one- 
third in the second quarter of 2020 
when lockdowns were in full force, but 
in the third quarter, the summer, when 
restrictions were relaxed, the economy 
made nearly a full recovery. This clear-
ly indicates that our economy is not in 
need of stimulus; it needs fewer tin pot 
dictators in Governors’ mansions. 
Much 
more 
troubling 
than 
Dr. 
Yellen’s call for more spending is her 
dismissal of the harms of continued 
borrowing. She has said that borrowing 
and spending is not a problem because 
interest rates are low. And the key 
part of her argument is that stimulus 
will generate more growth than inter-
est will cost to borrow. That is the def-
inition of ‘‘modern monetary theory.’’ 
She did not use that phrase because it 
is so obviously wrong-headed. Modern 
monetary theory is self-conflicted be-
cause proponents of it, like Dr. Yellen, 
say we can borrow in good time, but 
they never say we need to be austere in 
bad times. In fact, bad times are when 
they call for even more borrowing and 
spending. 
Modern monetary theory is nothing 
more than window dressing on a deep- 
seeded desire to always spend more, no 
matter what, and its proponents hope 
to reap electoral benefits now and to 
leave office before the bill comes due. 
Well, the bill is coming due. The Con-
gressional Budget Office already esti-
mates that interest on our current debt 
will begin growing at nearly 22 percent 
annually in just 6 years. What does 
that mean? Higher taxes or Venezuela- 
style inflation—Probably both. I sim-
ply cannot support a candidate who 
seeks to inflict such pain on the Amer-
ican people in just a few short years for 
an entirely unneeded stimulus today. 
We know what works—opening the 
economy. We know what does not 
work—modern monetary theory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S148 
January 26, 2021 
CONFIRMATION OF ANTONY JOHN 
BLINKEN 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
nomination of Antony J. Blinken to be 
U.S. Secretary of State. 
Mr. Blinken has decades of experi-
ence in foreign policy, beginning in the 
early 1990s as the Special Assistant to 
the Assistant Secretary for European 
and Canadian Affairs. He has since 
risen to senior foreign policy positions 
on Capitol Hill and in the executive 
branch, including as Democratic Staff 
Director on the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, and as Principal Dep-
uty National Security Adviser and 
Deputy Secretary of State in the 
Obama administration. I have had oc-
casion to work with him over the years 
and can testify to his professionalism, 
diligence, and good judgment. 
Mr. Blinken faces an enormous task. 
The last 4 years have been rife with 
chaos, 
division, 
and 
ineffective 
unilateralism. Under the so-called slo-
gan of ‘‘America First,’’ President 
Trump turned his back on allies and 
emboldened our adversaries, leaving 
the United States weakened, vulner-
able, and alone. Mr. Blinken must not 
only reverse the damage done by Presi-
dent Trump; he must reinvigorate U.S. 
leadership in a manner that meets the 
challenges we face today—from the ex-
istential threat of climate change, to a 
more aggressive and confrontational 
China. 
To begin, Mr. Blinken must restore 
our alliances, rebuild our global part-
nerships, expand our commercial ties, 
and rejoin the critical international 
agreements and organizations reck-
lessly abandoned by President Trump. 
Already President Biden has reversed 
Trump’s Muslim ban, rejoined the 
Paris climate accords, and recommit-
ted to the World Health Organization. 
In the coming months, Mr. Blinken 
must work with our allies to develop a 
united front to counter the threats 
posed by adversaries such as China, 
Russia, and Iran. He must reaffirm our 
commitment to NATO. He must rees-
tablish U.S. leadership in providing de-
velopment and humanitarian assist-
ance around the world, reasserting U.S. 
values of democracy, human rights, 
and the rule of law. 
As importantly, Mr. Blinken must re-
store the State Department itself. The 
Trump administration routinely under-
mined and smeared our dedicated ca-
reer foreign and civil service officers. 
Rebuilding the morale of our talented 
public servants will be imperative for 
the successful execution of our foreign 
policy. 
Given the breadth of his knowledge 
and experience, I am confident Mr. 
Blinken is the right person to meet 
America’s foreign policy challenges, 
and I support his confirmation as U.S. 
Secretary of State. 
f 
59TH INAUGURAL CEREMONIES 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I request 
to have printed in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD my full remarks delivered on 
January 20, 2021, at the 59th inaugural 
ceremonies. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Mr. President, Well, I should have known 
when Senator Klobuchar got involved, at 
least there would be a touch of snow up here 
this morning. Of all the things we consid-
ered, I don’t think snow was on my agenda 
until I walked out the door a moment ago. 
But thank you, Senator Klobuchar, and 
thanks to the other members of the Joint 
Congressional Committee on the Inaugura-
tion as we officially begin the 59th Inaugural 
Ceremony. I also want to thank the Joint 
Committee staff and our partners, particu-
larly our security partners, for the way they 
have 
dealt 
with 
unprecedented 
cir-
cumstances. 
When I chaired the Inauguration four years 
ago, I shared President Reagan’s 1981 de-
scription of this event as commonplace and 
miraculous. Commonplace because we’ve 
done it every four years since 1789. Miracu-
lous because we’ve done it every four years 
since 1789. 
Americans have celebrated this moment 
during war, during depression, and now, dur-
ing pandemic. Once again, all three branches 
of our government come together as the Con-
stitution envisions. Once again, we renew 
our commitment to ‘‘Our Determined De-
mocracy, Forging a More Perfect Union.’’ 
That theme for this Inauguration, ‘‘Our 
Determined Democracy, Forging a More Per-
fect Union,’’ was announced by the Joint 
Committee before the election—with the be-
lief that the United States can only fulfill its 
promise and set an example for others if we 
are always working to be better than we 
have been. 
The Constitution established that deter-
mined democracy with its first three words, 
declaring the people as the source of the gov-
ernment. The Articles of Confederation 
hadn’t done that. The Magna Carta hadn’t 
done that. Only the Constitution says the 
government exists because the people are the 
source of the reason it exists. They imme-
diately followed those first three words with 
the words ‘‘to form a more perfect Union.’’ 
The founders did not say ‘‘to form a perfect 
Union.’’ They did not claim that in our new 
country nothing would need to be improved. 
Fortunately, they understood that always 
working to be better would be the hallmark 
of a great democracy. 
The freedoms we have today, the nation we 
have today, is not here just because it hap-
pened, and they aren’t complete. 
A great democracy, working through the 
successes and failures of our history, striving 
to be better than it had been. And we are 
more than we have been and we are less than 
we hope to be. 
The assault on our Capitol at this very 
place just two weeks ago reminds us that a 
government designed to balance and check 
itself is both fragile and resilient. 
During the last year, the pandemic chal-
lenged our free and open society and called 
for extraordinary determination and sac-
rifice—and still challenges us today. Meeting 
that challenge head on have been and are 
health care workers, scientists, first re-
sponders, essential frontline workers, and so 
many others we depend on in so many ways. 
Today, we come to this moment. People all 
over the world, as we’re here, are watching 
and will watch what we do here. 
Our government comes together. The Con-
gress and the Courts join the transition of 
executive responsibility. 
One political party more pleased today, 
and on every inaugural day, than the other. 
But this is not a moment of division. It’s a 
moment of unification. A new administra-
tion begins and brings with it a new begin-
ning. And with that our great national de-
bate goes forward and a determined democ-
racy will continue to be essential in pursuit 
of a more perfect Union and a better future 
for all Americans. What a privilege for me to 
join you today. 
Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO CHAD METZLER 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, if you ask 
100 Americans what qualities they 
want in a public servant, I would bet 
there are a few common words that 
would come up. Smart. Dedicated. Bi-
partisan. Honest. Trustworthy. Hum-
ble. Simply put, they will describe 
Chad Metzler—my legislative director 
for the past 8 years and one of the fin-
est public servants I have ever met. 
That is why today I rise with a heavy 
heart to wish Chad well as he prepares 
to embark on a new adventure . 
Each of us in this body understands 
that the Senate’s work is not entrusted 
solely to Senators. Our names may be 
on the door, but we can’t claim suc-
cesses on our own. Our staffs play a 
critical role in our efforts to navigate 
the complex challenges facing the Na-
tion and serve the American people. 
That is why hiring the right people is 
one of the most important decisions 
any Senator makes. If a Senator is 
lucky, they will find staffers who have 
extensive experience and knowledge of 
the legislative process; who aren’t 
afraid to challenge their boss’s pre-
conceived notions in the pursuit of bet-
ter policy; who are kind, level-headed 
public servants; who are generous col-
leagues; who understand the impor-
tance of the faith placed in us by the 
American people and work ever day to 
live up to this enormous responsibility. 
If a Senator is lucky, they will find 
staffers who check a few of those boxes. 
If they find someone who can do all of 
the above, they have hit the jackpot. 
When Chad Metzler joined my team as 
legislative director in 2013, I and the 
people of Maine hit the jackpot be-
cause he is all of those things and 
more. 
Over the past 8 years, I have had the 
privilege to have Chad lead my legisla-
tive team. Sadly, good fortune only 
lasts for so long. As Chad transitions 
into a new, exciting opportunity, I am 
confident that he will continue to 
make vital contributions to the Amer-
ican people in his new role, but before 
he leaves us, I want to take a moment 
to reflect on all his contributions to 
the Senate and the country. 
From my early days in the Senate, 
Chad’s experience was invaluable. Prior 
to joining my office, he spent 17 years 
working for Senator Herb Kohl, from 
his home State of Wisconsin. Through-
out that tenure, Chad spearheaded a 
number of important, varied respon-
sibilities—from serving as the Sen-
ator’s legislative director, to holding 
the position of staff director on the 
Senate Special Committee on Aging, to

managing Senator Kohl’s portfolio on 
the Appropriations Committee. That 
combination of skills made Chad a rare 
breed—an experienced Senate staffer 
who possessed both a generalist’s un-
derstanding of the big picture and a 
specialist’s ability to get into the 
weeds of thorny policy issues. 
Chad’s background was invaluable in 
helping to bring me up to speed on the 
Senate’s parliamentary procedures and 
the body’s unique, frustrating quirks. 
As a former Governor, I faced the 
unenviable task of shifting from the 
executive role to being just 1 of 100. As 
an Independent used to relying on bi-
partisan coalitions, the Senate’s often 
rigid partisanship presented its own 
challenges. Chad responded with cre-
ative thinking and dogged persistence, 
and the results were quickly apparent. 
Just a few short months after I came 
to Washington, Chad helped me lead a 
bipartisan compromise on student loan 
rates that is projected to save tax-
payers $715 million over the next 10 
years and an estimated $30 billion for 
students over the following 4 years. 
That legislation set the tone for our of-
fice—a focus on rolling up our sleeves, 
bipartisan work, coalition building, 
and commonsense solutions to the 
problems that plague the American 
people. 
In the years that followed, Chad and 
his legislative team helped to build on 
that mission through level-headed, an-
alytical thinking. Among other suc-
cesses, we have worked across the aisle 
to pass legislation that confronts the 
opioid epidemic sweeping our commu-
nities; improves America’s insufficient 
cyber defenses; helps more working 
families access childcare; and addresses 
the $12 billion maintenance backlog at 
America’s national parks. Each of 
these legislative successes came about 
through hard work and bipartisan dis-
cussions. More importantly, each made 
life better for our constituents. 
Obviously, Chad is a talented legisla-
tive craftsman, but somehow, he was 
an even better leader and person. For 
the past 8 years, Chad has guided my 
legislative team with a steady hand, 
helping dozens of young public servants 
in my office grow and thrive. He treats 
everyone he meets with respect and 
kindness, never once talking down to 
someone with less experience or a dif-
ferent perspective. Just as important, 
his sense of humor has remained intact 
through a quarter century of Senate 
service, ensuring that even in the 
midst of serious work, we don’t take 
ourselves too seriously. 
When I was Governor, I said I always 
was looking for staff who demonstrate 
both competence and kindness. You 
can have some with one trait, some 
with the other, a few with neither, but 
when you find folks with both, you in-
vite them onboard immediately. Chad 
doesn’t just have those qualities; he 
personifies them. 
As you can gather from my remarks, 
Chad is an irreplaceable part of my 
team, and the Senate is poorer for los-
ing him. But, as Chad always does, I 
feel the need to take a step back and 
analyze the entire situation. In doing 
so, I find a few key reasons for grati-
tude. 
I am grateful that even though Chad 
is moving on, he leaves behind a team 
that is well-educated in the Metzler 
School of Public Service. His years of 
mentorship have crafted our team into 
one of the sharpest, most dedicated 
staffs on Capitol Hill, and I know his 
influence and example will be felt in 
our office for years to come. 
I am grateful that although our body 
is losing a dedicated public servant, the 
country is not. In the days ahead, Chad 
will begin a new opportunity that will 
put his skills to good use. This new 
role will allow him to continue fight-
ing for pragmatic, principled solutions 
that move our country forward. Now 
more than ever, we need folks like him 
working on tough problems. 
Finally, I am grateful that even 
though Chad will no longer be on my 
staff, he will forever remain a trusted 
adviser and friend. Chad’s intellect, 
professionalism, and warmth are rare 
attributes; to possess all of these quali-
ties, while still remaining humble and 
even-keeled, is even rarer. I consider 
myself extremely fortunate to know 
him and look forward to continuing 
that association. 
Mr. President, I have a simple philos-
ophy of leadership that has guided me 
throughout my life: Hire good people, 
and take credit for what they do. When 
I hired Chad Metzler, I made one of the 
smartest leadership decisions of my 
life—bringing on the ideal partner to 
break bipartisan logjams and make life 
better for the people of Maine. I am 
saddened to say goodbye to my adviser 
and friend today, but I know that his 
best is yet to come. I can’t wait to see 
what is next.

RECOGNIZING 
GORHAM 
MIDDLE 
AND HIGH SCHOOL’S SOPHOMORE 
STUDENT COUNCIL 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize the Sophomore Stu-
dent Council at Gorham Middle & High 
School as December’s Granite Staters 
of the Month. When a vendor acciden-
tally sent extra chocolate as part of 
the Sophomore Student Council’s fund-
raiser, the students launched a new ef-
fort. Instead of reselling the surplus 
chocolate to benefit their class, they 
decided to sell the extra chocolate to 
benefit their school’s food pantry. 
Like most events this year, the Soph-
omore Student Council modified a 
fundraiser that they would typically 
hold in-person to be an online event. 
One of the participants in the fund-
raiser, the aunt of Sophomore Student 
Council 
Representative 
Emma 
LaPierre, bought three boxes of choco-
late to benefit her niece’s class. How-
ever, instead of receiving the expected 
three boxes of chocolate, she received 
three entire cases of chocolate. The 
vendor, World’s Finest Chocolate, was 
alerted to the mistake, but due to safe-
ty concerns around the COVID–19 pan-
demic, said that they could not take 
the chocolate back. Emma, along with 
other members of the Sophomore Stu-
dent Council, decided that rather than 
sell the extra chocolate to profit their 
class, they would use the additional 
funds to benefit their school’s food and 
supply pantry. After selling the choco-
late at a reduced rate, the students 
successfully raised $200 for the pantry, 
which provides weekend meals, snacks, 
and school supplies to any student in 
need. Following the students’ efforts, a 
local paper published an article about 
the fundraiser, which inspired a couple 
in the community to send a $100 check 
to the school to benefit their food and 
supply pantry. 
Emma and the other students in Gor-
ham’s Sophomore Student Council ex-
emplify the way that small acts of 
kindness can make a big difference in a 
community. Their selfless decision to 
raise money on behalf of a community- 
wide resource, rather than keep the 
funds for their class, helped to spur 
other acts of kindness in their commu-
nity from which the whole school and 
community benefited. I am honored to 
recognize their efforts and proud that 
their efforts reflect the Granite State’s 
core value—the belief that individuals 
should step up when they see a prob-
lem—and that when they do, their ac-
tions have a ripple effect that strength-
ens the entire community. The Gorham 
Sophomore Student Council has done 
just that.∑

January 26, 2021 
Established by Cheryl Jones and her 
daughter Kayloni Perry, 44East spe-
cializes in home goods and gifts. Cheryl 
and Kayloni’s shared love for crafting 
gifts and home decorations inspired 
their entrepreneurial success. With the 
support and encouragement of their 
friends and family, they opened 44East 
in 2017. Since then, it has developed a 
reputation for its exceptional service 
and its unique, curated array of prod-
ucts and home decor items. The owners 
take pride in supporting their local 
business community by sourcing one- 
of-a-kind and specialty products from 
other small businesses in the Treasure 
Valley and Pacific Northwest. 
Like many small businesses, 44East 
faced an uncertain future during the 
early months of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Confronted with the possibility 
of 
permanent 
closure, 
Cheryl 
and 
Kayloni quickly adapted 44East’s busi-
ness model and began offering their 
products virtually through a social 
media campaign dubbed ‘‘Live at 5 to 
Survive.’’ Soon, customers began flock-
ing to 44East’s social channels to pur-
chase their products. ‘‘Live at 5 to Sur-
vive’’ did more than just ensure the 
continued survival of 44East; it intro-
duced hundreds of customers to the 
business and resulted in a swell of new 
sales. Today, 44East continues to host 
its ‘‘Live at 5 to Survive’’ campaign 
and has since reopened its doors, insti-
tuting health safety measures to pro-
tect its customers. 44East’s resource-
fulness and ingenuity is a testament to 
Idaho’s entrepreneurial spirit. 
Congratulations to Cheryl, Kayloni, 
and all of the employees of 44East on 
being selected as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for January 2021. 
You make our great State proud, and I 
look forward to your continued growth 
and success.∑

STATEMENTS 
ON 
INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
ON JANUARY 25, 2021 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. SCHUMER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
and Mr. MARKEY): 
S. 36. A bill to require certain heli-
copters to be equipped with safety 
technologies, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the ‘‘Kobe Bry-
ant and Gianna Bryant Helicopter 
Safety Act’’. 
I’m pleased to be joined today by 
Senators SCHUMER, BLUMENTHAL, and 
MARKEY in reintroducing this bill. 
Nearly one year ago today, on Janu-
ary 26, 2020, a helicopter carrying nine 
Californians flew into foggy weather 
and crashed minutes later. Los Angeles 
and the world soon learned that among 
the crash victims were basketball leg-
end Kobe Bryant and his daughter 
Gianna. 
After the crash, we soon learned the 
names and stories of John, Alyssa, and 
Keri Altobelli; Sarah and Payton Ches-
ter; 
Christina 
Mauser; 
and 
Ara 
Zobayan. These were spirited friends 
and family members connected by 
their love of sport, traveling to a week-
end basketball tournament. 
The sudden and shocking nature of 
the accident touched many, and the 
public remembrances in Los Angeles 
and around the world to honor the vic-
tims are proof that their memories will 
not soon be forgotten. 
But this tragedy is one that could 
have been averted. A preliminary re-
port and investigatory documents re-
leased by the National Transportation 
Safety Board indicate the helicopter 
was flying through thick clouds and 
fog, yet was not equipped with a ter-
rain awareness and warning system. 
This technology provides pilots with 
real-time, inflight warning signals and 
an image of surrounding terrain. 
Since 2006, the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board has recommended 
to the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA) that all new and existing 
helicopters capable of carrying six or 
more passengers be equipped with ter-
rain awareness and warning system 
technology. However, FAA has only re-
quired these warning systems for air 
ambulances. 
Nevertheless, this technology has be-
come standard on new helicopters from 
Airbus, Bell, Leonardo, and Sikorsky 
since December 2018. But older heli-
copters remain vulnerable. 
Our bill also requires crash-resistant 
flight data and voice recorders. Other-
wise known as black boxes, this tech-
nology is important for when accidents 
do happen and mistakes are made. It 
would allow agencies like the NTSB to 
have a better understanding of the in-
cident and provide more information to 
the FAA to prevent future accidents. 
It is clear that additional steps are 
needed to ensure that helicopters can 
fly safely, both for the sake of pas-
sengers and those on the ground. 
Our bill offers a common-sense ap-
proach to preventing further accidents 
like this one. It would simply direct 
the FAA to implement the NTSB’s rec-
ommendations 
to 
require 
terrain 
awareness and warning systems and 
flight data and voice recorders on all 
helicopters carrying six or more pas-
sengers. 
I appreciate the hard work of the Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board in 
developing 
these 
important 
rec-
ommendations, and it is long past time 
that the FAA heeds its call. 
My thoughts continue to be with the 
victims and their loved ones impacted 
by this heartbreaking accident. It is 
critical that Congress pass our bill 
swiftly to ensure that such loss of life 
was not in vain. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.
