PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, Father of us all, thank 
You for giving us another day. 
As the numbers of those infected by 
coronavirus continue to rise through-
out our country, send us Your spirit of 
healing and comfort. Healthcare work-
ers tire with the unrelenting burden of 
caring for so many who are ill. 
Strengthen them. May all Americans 
be sincere in their appreciation of he-
roic efforts to tend to those in need. 
As Members return to their districts, 
may the work of building and rebuild-
ing our communities show signs of 
progress and hope. These are difficult 
days, when impatience and frustration 
are dangerous temptations. Give us 
faith, hope, and, perhaps most impor-
tantly, love, that we might together 
build toward a newly thriving common 
weal. 
May all that is done throughout our 
country this day be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God of light, as we approach Inde-
pendence Day, we thank You for giving 
us the gift of true freedom. 
You have blessed us with freedom 
from sin, guilt, and shame. You have 
redeemed us. You have also given us 
freedom from fear, providing us with 
peace in the midst of the storms. 
Today, please guide our lawmakers 
so that they will fulfill Your purposes 
as they face the challenges of these 
times. Lord, awaken them to Your in-
escapable presence. Keep them from 
thinking that You are absent from our

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
Department of Defense is the only 
agency that can’t get a clean audit. 
Sometime around 1990, there was an 
audit law passed directing Depart-
ments to get to a point where they 
could get a clean audit. DOD is still the 
only one that hasn’t. 
Sometime around 2010, I believe, we 
laid down a requirement that the clean 
audit date ought to be met by 2017. 
Well, that wasn’t met. So, for decades, 
DOD has been saying that they are al-
most there. Now they say it will be at 
least another 5 years before a clean 
opinion can be reached. 
One reason they haven’t been able to 
do that is the outdated mess of hun-
dreds of financial management sys-
tems. Yet the Department of Defense 
still wants to spend almost $200 million 
on an annual audit. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment to pause the audit effort 
that is doomed to fail anyway and, in-
stead, invest that $200 million in updat-
ing the Department of Defense finan-
cial management system because, until 
they get the financial management 
systems right, DOD will never be capa-
ble of having a clean audit. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, be-
fore I discuss the legislation before the 
Senate, I need to spend a moment on 
something broader. Our country needs 
to confront the Democratic Party’s 
willingness to threaten our governing 
institutions themselves. 
Earlier this year, as the Senate dis-
posed of the least fair, least thorough, 
and most rushed impeachment in mod-
ern history, I offered a broader warn-
ing. I said: ‘‘Leaders in the opposite 
party increasingly argue that if our in-
stitutions don’t produce the outcomes 
they like, our institutions themselves 
must be broken.’’ 
No longer do disappointments for 
Democrats mean that Democrats need 
better 
arguments. 
Now 
disappoint-
ments for Democrats are claimed as 
proof—proof—that our country is fun-
damentally broken or that James 
Madison messed something up. 
So while we have far-left mobs at-
tacking statues of our Founding Fa-
thers from coast to coast, we have far- 
left politicians attacking the institu-
tions those Founders left us. 
Now, step back and look at the land-
scape of fundamental changes that 
leading Democrats or their close allies 
are demanding: amending the First 
Amendment to restrict its protections, 
ending the electoral college, packing 
the Supreme Court with new Justices, 
packing the Senate with new States, 
and, to accomplish all this, destroying 
the Senate’s distinguishing 
feature 
that makes radical change hard by de-
sign. 
We have an entire political move-
ment that is telling us—literally out 
loud—that they have lost patience with 
playing by the rules and may well de-
clare war on the rule book itself. A co-
alition of leftwing special interests are 
explicitly campaigning for ‘‘51 for 51.’’ 
They want Senators to vandalize the 
rules to pass legislation with a simple 
majority and then use that ill-gotten 
power to cement a presumed advantage 
by awarding the District of Columbia 
two Senate seats. 
They want to nuke the Senate to 
pack the Senate. This is naked politics. 
No neutral principle could explain why 
all these special interests prioritize 
this cause which most Americans op-
pose. No neutral principle explains why 
Democrats want the 20th most popu-
lous city to get two Senators all to 
itself when retrocession to Maryland 
would satisfy their own slogans more 
cleanly. 
No neutral principle explains why 
House Democrats wasted floor time on 
a potentially unconstitutional show 
vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4170 
July 2, 2020 
Just days after Democrats used the 
filibuster 
power 
to 
block 
Senator 
SCOTT’s police reform bill, even col-
leagues who recently defended this im-
portant tradition have now bowed to 
the pressure to flirt with ending it. 
On a similar note, you may remem-
ber that a kind of naked intimidation 
without modern precedent in modern 
memory took place a few months ago. 
The Democratic leader stood by the 
steps of the Supreme Court and di-
rectly threatened Justices if they ruled 
the wrong way in the June Medical 
Services case. 
This display aligned with a whole 
new tradition of Senate Democrats 
threatening judges. A year ago, several 
wrote Justices saying the ‘‘Court is not 
well [and] perhaps the Court can heal 
itself before the public demands it be 
‘restructured.’ ’’ 
In other words, nice judicial inde-
pendence you have got there. It would 
be a shame if something happened to 
it. 
Right on cue, a number of leftwing 
groups are agitating to revive the dis-
credited notion of court-packing. 
Now, following the Democratic lead-
er’s display, the Court ruled the way he 
wanted on that very case. They handed 
it down on Monday of this week. Our 
colleague took to the floor cracking 
jokes, giddy—giddy—he had gotten his 
way, but just moments later the Demo-
cratic leader picked right up where he 
left off, impugning and pressuring one 
Justice whose vote he disliked. 
So you see, the improper pressure 
and the accusations of illegitimacy 
will never end. No amount of rulings 
the Democrats like would be enough 
because the fundamental respect for an 
independent judiciary is simply not 
there. 
This is about outcomes, not institu-
tions, and there is no limit to how far 
left the goalposts will move. 
Well, the subject is not going away, 
but for today I will leave it there. This 
weekend, July 4, Americans will cele-
brate our founding. We will celebrate 
the Framers and the traditions and the 
institutions that they left us. 
We cannot let radicals tear down 
their likenesses or their legacies. We 
must preserve the gifts and the institu-
tions we celebrate so our grandchildren 
and their grandchildren can celebrate 
them as well. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
an entirely different matter, the Sen-
ate continues to consider the National 
Defense Authorization Act. I under-
stand we are close to a bipartisan 
structure for amendments, and if our 
Democratic colleagues will let us, I 
hope we can move forward today. 
All week I have discussed how the 
60th consecutive NDAA will help our 
Nation protect its people, stand with 
our allies, and keep pace with our com-
petitors. This legislation has global 
reach, but, as all my colleagues know, 
the NDAA is also a profoundly local 
bill for communities in all 50 States. 
My home State is proud to support 
three Army installations and the men 
and women of the Kentucky Air and 
Army National Guard. Last fall, I 
hosted Defense Secretary Mark Esper 
in Kentucky to speak with the Fort 
Knox community. He called for a re-
newed commitment to supporting our 
all-volunteer force, including military 
spouses and their families. 
The NDAA advances that goal. It will 
authorize a new elementary school at 
Fort Knox. This construction, paired 
with progress toward a new middle 
school at Fort Campbell, will continue 
making Kentucky’s installations a wel-
coming home for military families. 
This project comes on the heels of 
Fort Knox’s selection for the new V 
Corps 
headquarters. 
This 
mission 
brings more than 600 additional sol-
diers to Kentucky in support of U.S. 
operations over in Europe. They will 
join Fort Knox’s already impressive 
list of significant commands, including 
the Army’s Recruiting, Cadet, and 
Human Resources Command. The V 
Corps will find a premier installation 
made even better by this NDAA. 
Our bill also authorizes the construc-
tion of a new headquarters for the Ken-
tucky National Guard. The facility will 
consolidate the Guard’s operation to a 
central location. 
Just recently, our citizen soldiers 
and airmen have stepped up to combat 
COVID–19. I am glad this legislation 
will deliver for them. 
At the Blue Grass Army Depot, the 
NDAA will advance the disposal of leg-
acy chemical weapons. Families in 
Madison County have lived for genera-
tions with these deadly agents prac-
tically in their backyards. For years, I 
have fought alongside them to support 
safe and responsible demilitarization. 
In just the first year of chemical de-
struction activities, the depot has al-
ready completed a campaign ahead of 
schedule. An entire type of munition 
has been completely deleted from the 
U.S. stockpile. Our legislation will help 
us safely consign more of these weap-
ons to the ash heap of history. 
Now, I have also spoken this week 
about the growing boldness of our Na-
tion’s adversaries and the evolving 
threats our servicemembers face. The 
men and women of Fort Campbell, in-
cluding the 101st Airborne, are among 
those our Nation turns to first to han-
dle serious challenges. Their recent de-
ployments to Europe, Afghanistan, and 
to support the COVID–19 response in 
New York and New Jersey show their 
importance to our country. 
Pursuant to the national defense 
strategy, this NDAA will encourage 
new capabilities so elite fighting forces 
like the 101st are equipped for success 
under any circumstances. 
The Senate is grateful for the coura-
geous service of our Armed Forces. The 
bipartisan legislation before us honors 
their sacrifices and authorizes the re-
sources to carry out their missions. Its 
impact will not be felt just by our ad-
versaries overseas but by our service-
members and communities right here 
at home. 
I would like to once again thank 
Chairman INHOFE, Ranking Member 
REED, and our colleagues on the Armed 
Services Committee for their serious 
and thoughtful work. 
Let’s get this bill moving toward 
completion.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, two 
numbers sum up the state of America 
today: 52,788, the number of confirmed 
COVID–19 cases yesterday; and 1.4 mil-
lion, the number of unemployment 
claims filed this week. In the next few 
months, these numbers will be far more 
important than the job numbers re-
leased this morning in determining the 
long-term health of our economy and 
the health of this country. The statis-
tics I mentioned would have been 
harrowing during February, March, 
April, or May, during the initial surge 
and rapid spread of the disease. They 
would have been distressing even then, 
but here in the beginning of July, 6 
months into the crisis, long after other 
countries have experienced a rapid de-
cline of COVID–19, it is shocking that 
the United States is hitting ever 
grimmer milestones. 
There is no doubt that much of the 
responsibility 
for 
this 
debacle—the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4171 
July 2, 2020 
COVID debacle—falls on the shoulders 
of President Trump, who failed to pre-
pare our Nation for the initial surge, 
failed to organize a national supply 
chain of PPE, failed to develop a na-
tional strategy for testing and contact 
tracing, and failed to even commu-
nicate the depth of the challenge our 
country faces. And much of this still 
proves true today. 
The Washington Post reported this 
morning that Arizona, which has expe-
rienced a huge surge in cases, still 
doesn’t have the testing supplies they 
need because of a national supply chain 
failure. 
Even after 2.6 million infections and 
120,000 American fatalities, the Presi-
dent said yesterday: 
I think we’re going to be very good with 
the coronavirus. I think at some point that’s 
going to sort of just disappear. 
Can you imagine the bubble this man 
is in? He is only concerned about 
scratching and stroking his own ego 
and not about what is going on in the 
country, so he can just dismiss the se-
riousness of this—the most serious 
health and economic crisis we have had 
in decades. It is amazing. 
That is what President Trump said 
yesterday: ‘‘We’re going to be very 
good with the coronavirus’’—on the 
same day the United States reported 
the most new cases of coronavirus in a 
single day ever. The President is so 
eager to declare victory and pat him-
self on the back and then move on that 
he is ignoring reality completely. 
The June jobs report showed modest 
growth, but we know conditions have 
worsened since the survey was com-
pleted in the middle of the month. Ex-
perts believe 10 percent of the work-
force has lost their job permanently, 
with Americans of color counting for a 
disproportionate share. 
Again, in terms of the long-term 
health of the economy, the most con-
cerning and important number is the 
number of new COVID cases. The num-
ber of COVID cases, health-related, is 
the No. 1 effect on the long-term health 
of 
the 
economy. 
President 
Trump 
seems oblivious to the fact that almost 
everyone who studied this issue knows. 
The President’s own CDC Director says 
the number of cases may be 10 times 
higher than reported. Imagine that. We 
could have 26 million people infected 
and likely many, many more to come, 
but the President assumes that the 
coronavirus—and 
the 
economy—will 
just take care of itself. 
If President Trump reacted to the 
jobs report like he has reacted to 
COVID and says, ‘‘We’re in the clear; 
we don’t have to do anything,’’ then we 
will soon be in even worse trouble than 
we are today. 
Here in the Senate, the Republican 
majority has been out to lunch since 
we passed the CARES Act way back in 
March. It has been over 3 months since 
the Republican Senate has considered 
major COVID relief legislation. Weekly 
unemployment claims are measured in 
the millions. States are shedding pub-
lic service jobs in the tens of thou-
sands. The number of new cases is ac-
celerating in nearly half our States. 
Still, the Republican majority, in the 
words of its majority leader, ‘‘has yet 
to feel the urgency of acting.’’ Still, 
the Republican leader says we must 
‘‘assess the conditions’’ in the country 
before providing relief to our citizens. 
Just how much more assessment do we 
need when we remember those two 
numbers—52,000 new cases and 1.4 mil-
lion people applying for unemploy-
ment? 
Every day this week, Senate Demo-
crats have come to the floor to plead 
with our colleagues to take up legisla-
tion to help millions of American 
workers and small businesses that are 
struggling right now. Every day this 
week, Senate Republicans have blocked 
our 
requests: 
rental 
assistance, 
blocked; food assistance, blocked; mor-
atorium on evictions, blocked; re-
sources for schools, nursing homes, 
State and local governments, Indian 
Country, 
and 
elections—blocked, 
blocked, blocked, and blocked. Just 
how long will this Republican Senate 
majority prevent the American people 
from getting the aid they so des-
perately need? 
Now Republicans are saying we have 
to do another bill before August. I am 
glad they are finally talking seriously 
about a fourth phase of coronavirus 
legislation, though the need has been 
obvious for months. But the Repub-
lican leader at the moment insists that 
the next bill will be ‘‘written in his of-
fice.’’ Written in his office? That is the 
same one-party, ‘‘take it or leave it’’ 
partisan approach that delayed the 
CARES Act and utterly failed on polic-
ing reform. 
Leader MCCONNELL likes to remind 
us that we need to make a law, not a 
point. To make a law, leader, you need 
both parties, you need both Chambers 
of Congress, and you need the signa-
ture of the President. Starting the next 
phase of COVID legislation in the ma-
jority leader’s office is exactly what 
you do if you wanted to make a point, 
not a law. 
The House of Representatives already 
has a bill that it has passed. It needs to 
be part of the equation here. In order 
to make a law, both parties in both 
Chambers should have a seat at the 
table. That is how we got the last 
phase of COVID–19 legislation done, 
and it is the best way to get it done 
this time. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STATEHOOD 
Mr. President, we have serious dis-
agreements here in Congress. We trade 
in passionate words, but words some-
times get a little too hot under the col-
lar. There are times when we need to 
take a step back and really think 
about what we are saying. 
Yesterday, speaking in opposition to 
DC Statehood, the junior Senator from 
Montana said lawmakers should ‘‘go 
out to where the real people are across 
the country and ask them what they 
think.’’ 
‘‘Go out to where the real people 
are.’’ 
Over 700,000 people live and work in 
the District of Columbia, 46 percent of 
them are Black. They hold jobs just 
like everyone else. They teach, deliver 
groceries, care for our sick, and work 
in our restaurants and churches. Many 
of them work here in the Capitol, pro-
viding essential services to some Sen-
ators who, obviously, don’t consider 
them ‘‘real people.’’ 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle would have you believe that every 
member of this city is a lobbyist or de-
fense contractor or a reporter. Not 
only is that comically false, but I don’t 
remember the part of the Constitution 
where it says your rights as American 
citizens only apply if Republican Sen-
ators approve of your line of work. 
I have noticed that it has become 
fashionable for elements of the polit-
ical right to accuse Democrats of ig-
noring ‘‘real Americans.’’ It seems that 
the political right has a clear idea of 
which Americans are real and which 
Americans are not. 
When Republican Senators are out-
right dismissing the personhood of 
thousands of American citizens—most 
of whom are Black—it is time for the 
political right to look in the mirror. 
DC residents fulfill all the obliga-
tions of citizenship. They pay Federal 
taxes. They can be summoned for jury 
duty. They have served in every war 
since the Revolutionary War. But they 
are denied real representation in Con-
gress. 
We can have a real conversation 
about Statehood without denigrating 
or dehumanizing these citizens, but the 
far right is so afraid of losing political 
power and so unwilling to appeal to 
anyone who doesn’t already agree with 
them that their strategy has become: 
restrict voting rights and deny equal 
representation in Congress to hundreds 
of thousands of Americans. 
Self-governance and equal represen-
tation aren’t Democratic issues or Re-
publican 
issues. 
Voting 
rights 
shouldn’t be a Democratic issue or a 
Republican issue. These are issues of 
fairness, of equality. It is not about 
right or left. It is about right and 
wrong. 
SENATE RULES 
Mr. President, for a minute on rules 
changes, I heard the Republican leader 
come forward and decry any attempt to 
change the rules. He is not a good one 
to give advice. Leader MCCONNELL has 
shown that he will change the rules 
when it suits his purposes and defend 
the rules when it suits his purposes. He 
is no icon standing in the way of any 
rules change. We all saw what hap-
pened in the last few years. 
So please, Leader MCCONNELL, don’t 
give us advice on rules changes when 
you are so inconsistent about which 
rules are OK to change and which rules 
are not.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4172 
July 2, 2020 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, governing is a matter 
of priorities. In this moment of na-
tional crisis, as the COVID–19 pan-
demic rages on, economic hardship 
deepens and the centuries-old struggle 
for racial justice is waged anew. Our 
national priorities have never been 
clearer to everyone, it seems, but 
President Trump. 
This week has been one of the most 
out-of-touch weeks of an out-of-touch 
Presidency. As the citizens of ruby red 
Oklahoma voted to expand Medicaid, 
President Trump, this week, advanced 
his administration’s lawsuit to elimi-
nate our healthcare law and Medicaid 
expansion along with it. As protesters 
continued to march in the streets for 
racial justice, President Trump, this 
week, attacked a program designed to 
end racial segregation in housing. As 
the State of Mississippi decided to take 
down the Confederate flag, President 
Trump threatened to veto the national 
defense bill, including a pay raise for 
our troops, in the name of protecting 
the Confederacy. 
This week, the President of the 
United States seemed more concerned 
with protecting the names of dead Con-
federate generals than doing anything 
to help living American citizens. The 
President is so out of touch that it is 
as if he was dropped into the Oval Of-
fice from another planet, unaware and 
uncaring of anything going on around 
him. Whether it is the resurgent 
COVID killing Americans, a faltering 
economy, a righteous movement for ra-
cial justice, or Putin’s malign actions 
endangering 
our 
troops, 
President 
Trump has the same reaction: stroke 
his own ego, then stick his head in the 
sand and do nothing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
briefly discuss a matter that is con-
tained within the NDAA bill that is 
currently pending before the Senate, a 
matter for which I sponsored as an 
amendment, in the Committee on 
Armed Services’ markup on the bill, 
that received the unanimous voice vote 
of my colleagues, and I just wanted to 
stress its importance. 
A few weeks back, on a Monday in 
May, peaceful protesters assembled in 
Lafayette Square to protest against po-
lice violence. They were peaceful, and 
they were in full compliance with a 
curfew ordinance that was in place. It 
was before the curfew. Federal law en-
forcement officials fired tear gas at 
them to disperse them, which I found 
very, very troubling, as, I know, many 
people did. What concerned me even 
more was the President’s indicating 
that he might use Active-Duty mili-
tary against the protesters. That was 
happening during the same week that 
we were submitting amendments to the 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
So I wrote up a very simple amend-
ment that read: No funds under this 
Act shall be used for any military pro-
gram or personnel to infringe upon peo-
ple’s rights to peacefully assemble or 
petition government for a redress of 
grievances. 
It 
was 
a 
very 
simple 
amendment. 
There is an act, the Insurrection Act, 
that sets forth specific circumstances 
under which the military can be used 
to do law enforcement activities for do-
mestic purposes, but I wanted to have 
the strong statement that the military 
should not be used to infringe upon 
people’s rights to peacefully assemble 
and petition the government. I was 
proud, when I presented that to my 
committee colleagues within a week 
after this event, that they agreed and, 
by a unanimous voice vote, included it 
in the base bill. 
I want to just stress why I think this 
is so very, very important, and I appre-
ciate my colleagues’ support to this 
point. Peaceful protests are protected 
in the First Amendment, and I think 
the Framers of the Bill of Rights, when 
they protected something, they sort of 
encouraged it. I think the Framers of 
the 
Constitution 
got 
some 
things 
wrong, but they also got some things 
right. 
One of the things I have always been 
interested in is that, while elections 
are important—and elections and cam-
paigns are in the Constitution as being 
every 2 years for the House, every 6 
years for the Senate, and Presidential 
elections—the Framers knew elections 
wouldn’t be enough to protect this 
great democracy. If they had thought 
elections would have been enough, they 
wouldn’t have said that people need to 
be able to peacefully assemble and that 
people need to be able to petition the 
government for a redress of grievances. 
If elections had been enough, they 
would have said: Well, if you are mad, 
just wait 2 years, and then you can 
vote out somebody bad and bring in 
somebody good. 
The Framers had been through the 
experiences of things like the Boston 
Tea Party and other events. They knew 
that to have a more perfect Union and 
really preserve the democracy, they 
needed to have elections, but they also 
needed to give people the room and the 
space to be able to peacefully assemble 
and say: Hey, I don’t like this. Can we 
make these changes? 
It is a value that is so important, 
like the freedom of religion and the 
freedom of the press, and were put in 
the First Amendment for a reason. 
Those in the military, just as Sen-
ators, take vows to support and defend 
the Constitution of the United States. 
Yet, in particular today, 2020, we have 
a significant issue that I see cropping 
up sometimes, which is, thank good-
ness, that we as civilians appreciate 
the military—that the ‘‘thank you for 
your service’’ attitude, I think, is wide-
ly shared. There is often a gulf between 
the military and civilians because, in 
the time of an all-volunteer military, 
only 1 percent of people serve in the 
military. That means, for those of us 
who haven’t served, often, we might 
have a general appreciation, but we 
don’t really have an understanding, 
and there can start to be a gap, or a 
gulf, between civilians and the mili-
tary. 
Former Secretary of Defense Mattis 
has commented about this a lot, about 
this gap that can grow. I am not chal-
lenging that an all-volunteer military 
is a good thing, but there can be a gap 
of misunderstanding. We would never 
want to widen that gap, and we should 
always do things to narrow that gap. 
There would be nothing that would 
widen the gap more than if people were 
to perceive that the military were now 
being arrayed against them, against 
the civilian population. It would not 
only endanger important First Amend-
ment rights, but it would also poten-
tially lead to a wider canyon between 
the civilian and the military, and we 
should not do that. 
There can be uses of military assets 
in protest situations. A sort of stand-
ard way of thinking about it, for exam-
ple, would be to use Guard troops. The 
Guard is often called up to protect pro-
testers, and then local law enforcement 
is used to police bad actors. One would 
use a group like the Guard to protect 
protesters, to keep them safe, and to 
make sure they are not doing things to 
or are being harmed by others, but the 
law enforcement activity should be 
carried out by police and not by the 
military. 
This is something we promote in the 
Committee on Foreign Relations all 
the time. I see my colleague from Wyo-
ming who is here, who is on the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations with me 
and does such a good job there. We are 
often 
encouraging 
foreign 
nations: 
Don’t use your military to do police 
work. Have a professional police de-
partment. Use your military to defend 
the country. The professionalizing of 
police is an important thing, because 
that is not what a military should do. 
That was the reason I introduced the 
amendment. It was not solely to pro-
tect First Amendment rights, which 
are really important, but it was also to 
not allow a gulf that exists between ci-
vilians and the military to get even 
worse if civilians feel like the military 
is arrayed against them. 
The last thing I will say—and then I 
will conclude—is that I lived in a mili-
tary dictatorship when I was young. I 
took a year off in the middle of law 
school to go to Honduras and work 
with Jesuit missionaries in 1980 to 1981. 
It was a military dictatorship, and peo-
ple could not vote for anything. It was 
a shock to me, my seeing a society 
where people could vote and, maybe, 
sometimes even choose not to vote, and 
then my going to a society where peo-
ple couldn’t vote. People prayed for the 
day that they might be able to finally 
vote 
for 
their 
leaders, 
but 
they 
couldn’t because the military was run-
ning the country at the time. 
There I saw the reaction that the 
people had toward the military, and

the reaction that they had toward the 
military and to that form of govern-
ment was not ‘‘thank you for your 
service.’’ It was ‘‘you scare me to 
death.’’ There was military on every 
corner with automatic weapons. There 
were roundups, and they would do an 
organized draft. Sometimes they would 
just surround a movie theater, and as 
young men would come out, they would 
commandeer them to go into the mili-
tary. 
I experienced something so different 
from what I experience here, which was 
a society in which your first reaction 
when you see somebody in uniform—in 
the military—is fear. You are afraid of 
him. We would never want that to be 
the prevailing attitude here. We would 
want our attitude here to be ‘‘thanks 
for your service.’’ 
I believe my amendment, now incor-
porated in the NDAA, will preserve the 
important roles that the military 
plays, preserve the important prin-
ciples of peaceful assembly, petitioning 
government, First Amendment, but we 
will also make sure that we as a soci-
ety don’t find, by pitting the military 
against civilians, that we will be led to 
a situation where we will not be able to 
fully appreciate the sacrifices they 
make and the work they do for us. 
I am excited that the bill on the floor 
now contains this provision and hope 
my 
colleagues 
will 
promptly 
and 
quickly pass the NDAA. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Wyoming. 
JOBS REPORT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, as I 
come to the floor today, we have just 
seen incredible record-setting job num-
bers. It is wonderful news for American 
workers, for families all across the 
country. It is a stellar June jobs re-
port. 
The U.S. economy added 4.8 million 
jobs, shattering all expectations. It is 
the largest monthly jobs gain in our 
Nation’s history. 
So if you flip through the channels 
this morning, Mr. President—and I did 
see you on one of the morning shows, 
doing a wonderful job, as you always 
do, talking about your home State, 
talking about our Nation—but these 
were some of the comments today 
about the jobs numbers: 
CNBC’s Jim Cramer said: ‘‘There’s an 
optimism in the country . . . people 
are hiring.’’ 
Ed Lawrence at FOX Business said: 
‘‘This is amazing. A good report any-
where you look at it.’’ 
Becky Quick, CNBC, said it was a 
‘‘trend from across the board of pretty 
strong numbers.’’ 
Stephanie Ruhle of NBC said it was a 
‘‘big positive.’’ 
Charles Payne, FOX Business, said: 
‘‘Even though the economists keep say-
ing it’s impossible,’’ the numbers are 
terrific. 
Steve Liesman, CNBC, said: ‘‘Bring-
ing a lot of folks back.’’ 
Christine Romans of CNN: ‘‘Big hir-
ing.’’ 
Rick Santelli of CNBC: ‘‘Really solid 
numbers.’’ 
So good news. Americans are getting 
back to work, and we need to make 
sure that we reopen responsibly, smart-
ly, safely—the sorts of things you were 
talking about—knowing what to do, 
how to do it, how to do it right because 
the health and safety, as you men-
tioned, of our families is important, 
and it includes economic health as 
well, and we have that report today 
with a stellar jobs report. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. President, I also want to point 
out today that yesterday the Demo-
crats in the House passed their 100-per-
cent partisan version of a highway in-
frastructure bill. They co-opted a bi-
partisan issue, completely cut out Re-
publicans—completely cut them out of 
the conversation. 
Not only that, but House Democrats 
added a laundry list of really leftwing 
proposals in what they passed yester-
day in the House. 
In a sense, it is ‘‘Groundhog’s Day’’ 
for the Green New Deal. This far-left 
fantasy has become a recurring night-
mare, and we saw it yesterday on the 
floor of the House of Representatives. 
The Democrats must be taking their 
cue from Joe Biden. The Biden cam-
paign is promoting the Green New 
Deal, as he said, a ‘‘crucial frame-
work.’’ 
Biden has put the Green New Deal 
author, 
Representative 
ALEXANDRIA 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, in charge of his cli-
mate task force. This is where the 
Democrats want to take the country. 
The truth is, Joe Biden has just now 
become the Trojan horse for the far, far 
left. 
House Democrats’ partisan highway 
bill, to me, is a road to nowhere. It is 
going to see no light of day in the U.S. 
Senate. 
Infrastructure must be bipartisan, es-
pecially now. The House should follow 
the Senate’s lead. Senate Republicans, 
in the majority, have worked across 
the aisle with our Democratic col-
leagues to make this serious issue into 
policy that is good for all of America, 
and our bipartisan bill is ready to go. 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act passed the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee, 
the committee I chair, unanimously, 21 
to 0. The landmark legislation will fix 
our Nation’s roads, bridges, and tun-
nels. 
Now, we invest but $287 billion in our 
highways over 5 years. That is a 27-per-
cent increase over current highway 
funding, and it is important. It is espe-
cially critical to our economic recov-
ery today. 
We still have close to 20 million 
Americans out of work due to the 
coronavirus-related lockdowns. Jump- 
starting highway projects is going to 
speed the recovery, and it will help fuel 
job creation. 
Our bill benefits the entire country— 
both urban areas and rural areas. That 
is why we worked together in a bipar-
tisan way. I will tell you, when I say it 
is overwhelmingly bipartisan, it is be-
cause we have both BERNIE SANDERS 
and President Trump supporting it. In 
fact, President Trump called on Con-
gress to pass the Senate highway bill 
in his State of the Union Address. 
No question, it is the right medicine 
for our roads. It cuts redtape to speed 
up construction. It makes our roads 
safer, stronger, actually, as well, be-
cause of the reinforcement efforts, and 
it sends money directly to States so 
people can get back to work. 
Americans deserve a safe, reliable, ef-
ficient transportation system. So the 
Democrats in the House of Representa-
tives need to get serious. Their 100-per-
cent partisan bill is going nowhere. 
It does seem that the Democrats in 
the House are all about politics and 
nothing about progress—the progress 
we need to make as a country. They 
are over there pushing socialism, and 
right here we are pushing solutions. 
The 
country 
needs 
less 
grandstanding, and it needs more gov-
erning. So I am going to continue to 
work across the aisle. We will work 
with the administration and will not 
quit until our bipartisan highway in-
frastructure bill passes and becomes 
law. Together, we can rebuild America. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. President, now to the issue today 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are 
considering critical national security 
legislation. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act, NDAA, lays out America’s defense 
priorities for the coming years. The 
NDAA supports our brave service men 
and women, and it sets policies to de-
fend our Nation. 
The investments made through this 
bill safeguard our country from foreign 
threats, and there are many. This is 
why the NDAA has, over the years, be-
come must-pass legislation. 
In fact, the Defense policy bill has 
passed every year for decades. The Sen-
ate continues this proud tradition in 
taking up this, the 60th annual, Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
This legislation is bipartisan to its 
core. It reflects equal input from Re-
publicans and Democrats. The Senate 
Armed Services Committee adopted 229 
bipartisan amendments before approv-
ing the legislation this month by a 
vote in committee of 25 to 2. 
The NDAA will ensure a smart, 
strong, strategic defense for our Na-
tion, and it will maintain America’s 
dominance in a dangerous world. 
The bill supports $741 billion in fiscal 
year 2021 defense funding, and that is 
in line with the bipartisan Budget Act 
of 2019. It implements the national de-
fense strategy to promote a strong 
military deterrent and to strive for a 
lasting peace. 
You have seen it, Mr. President, and 
you have discussed it—with the world 
distracted, 
China 
has 
become 
emboldened. The Chinese military has 
stepped up its aggression against its 
neighbors and in the South China Sea.

Russia also poses a growing threat. 
China and Russia will not put their 
ambitions on hold for coronavirus or 
anything else. They will not wait for us 
or for them to recover from the 
coronavirus crisis and resolve our do-
mestic disputes. 
America must keep China and Russia 
both in check. The NDAA promotes a 
winning strategy. It modernizes our 
nuclear defenses. It maintains our 
high-tech edge over China and Russia. 
The NDAA honors our commitment to 
our dedicated men and women in uni-
form. 
It delivers a well-earned pay raise for 
our troops, as well as high-quality 
housing, healthcare, childcare services 
for military families at home as well as 
abroad. The NDAA ensures our force is 
ready to fight and to win. That means 
to fight and to win today’s wars, as 
well as the wars in the future. 
It provides state-of-the-art equip-
ment and tools our troops need to de-
fend America all around the world. The 
NDAA will help spur innovation. It in-
vests in new technologies: artificial in-
telligence, hypersonic weapons, bio-
technology, cyber security. 
The bill modernizes our Pentagon’s 
financial management system. It pro-
vides for greater accountability and 
transparency at the Defense Depart-
ment. This works to protect taxpayer 
money. 
The NDAA also includes innovative 
legislation that promotes a cleaner en-
vironment. Now, in saying that, I mean 
that my bipartisan bill with SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE of Rhode Island, SHELLEY 
MOORE
CAPITO, and TOM
CARPER
of 
Delaware—we have included as part of 
the NDAA the Environment and Public 
Works Committee-approved legislation 
unanimously. It is called the USE IT 
Act. It is included in the NDAA. ‘‘USE 
IT’’ is short for utilizing significant 
emissions 
with 
innovative 
tech-
nologies. That is why I am saying we 
are doing more to clean the environ-
ment. 
The USE IT Act will help researchers 
find commercial uses for captured car-
bon dioxide emissions. It supports the 
use of carbon capture technology, in-
cluding 
direct 
air 
capture. 
This 
groundbreaking research is already 
happening in my home State of Wyo-
ming. It is taking place at the Inte-
grated Test Center outside of Gillette. 
The USE IT Act will further this im-
portant work. 
It will apply our Nation’s brightest 
minds to take carbon from the air, trap 
it, and transform it into valuable com-
mercial products. Captured carbon can 
be used to extract oil from wells—wells 
that would not otherwise be profitable. 
It is also used to make building mate-
rials and carbon fibers. It can also be 
used for medical purposes. 
The goal of the legislation is to inno-
vate our way to a cleaner environment 
without onerous overregulation. 
So I want to thank the Armed Serv-
ices Committee chairman, JIM INHOFE, 
for bringing the USE IT Act one step 
closer to becoming law. 
For the past 4 years, Congress has 
been able to pass the NDAA with 
strong, top-line defense funding. The 
bipartisan Budget Act sets overall de-
fense funding levels for fiscal year 2021. 
Longer term funding is necessary, but 
it is uncertain. 
Democrats have opposed stronger de-
fense funding in the past, especially 
during the Obama-Biden administra-
tion. This history suggests that if 
Democrats win the election, they will 
slow our Nation’s critical defense in-
vestments. 
The NDAA strengthens America’s 
hand to stand up to foreign aggressors, 
to stand up against those people who 
are against American values. 
Our NDAA will protect American 
leadership in the world. It will enhance 
our standing with adversaries and al-
lies alike. Above all, it sends a clear 
message to our enemies: You cannot 
defeat the United States so don’t even 
try. 
Every Senator should support this 
smart, strong, strategic approach to 
America’s defense. 
Let’s honor this proud tradition; let’s 
support our troops; and let us once 
again pass the NDAA, this, for the 60th 
time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

PREVENTING ONLINE SALES OF E- 
CIGARETTES TO CHILDREN ACT 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am delighted this morning to be on the 
floor with the distinguished Senator 
from Texas. In order to proceed, I ask 
unanimous consent that, as in legisla-
tive session, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1253 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation.

ing to delivery sales of cigarettes to delivery 
sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems, 
and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
further ask unanimous consent that 
the Cornyn amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

SEC. 4. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF E-CIGA-
RETTE USE BY ADOLESCENTS AND 
YOUNG ADULTS. 
(a) STUDY.—The National Institutes of 
Health, in coordination with other appro-
priate agencies, shall conduct a study on the 
short-term and long-term health impacts of 
e-cigarette use by youth and young adults 
under 21 years of age, that includes the fol-
lowing: 
(1) An examination of the health impacts 
of using liquids obtained from the legal mar-
ket, including liquids that may not have pre-
market approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration, compared to liquids ob-
tained illicitly. 
(2) A determination of the precise relation-
ship between underage vaping and underage 
smoking, which may include using national 
survey data, in which the reporting of smok-
ing and vaping usage classifications (such as 
current users, former users, or never users) 
shall be integrated and not treated as sepa-
rate or unrelated categories. 
(3) A determination of the precise relation-
ship between vaping and smoking among 
young adults, who are 21 to 24 years of age, 
using national survey data, in which the re-
porting of smoking and vaping usage classi-
fications (such as current users, former 
users, or never users) shall be integrated and 
not treated as separate or unrelated cat-
egories. 
(4) An examination of e-cigarette usage 
data from cities, localities, and States that 
have adopted e-cigarette product bans to 
evaluate— 
(A) the proportion of e-cigarette users in 
those areas who return to smoking combus-
tible cigarettes; 
(B) the proportion of e-cigarette users in 
those areas who access products from illicit 
markets; and 
(C) the proportion of e-cigarette users in 
those areas who stop using all nicotine prod-
ucts or reduce their overall nicotine product 
use. 
(5) A determination of the frequency of use 
of each specific and multiple tobacco prod-
ucts among high school students in the 
United States, including— 
(A) the number of high school students 
who use each specific and multiple tobacco 
products less than 20 days per month; and 
(B) the number of high school students who 
use each specific and multiple tobacco prod-
ucts 20 or more days per month. 
(6) An examination of the rates of underage 
e-cigarette use in cities, localities, and 
States that have adopted Tobacco 21 laws 
prior to the date of enactment of the Further 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub-
lic Law 116–94). 
(7) An examination of illegal smuggling of 
tobacco products in cities, localities, and 
States that have— 
(A) banned such products; 
(B) enacted taxes on such products that are 
higher than the national median; or 
(C) enacted other legal restrictions on such 
products. 
(8) A determination of how prevalence esti-
mates of tobacco use in the National Youth 
Tobacco Survey differ from prevalence esti-
mates of tobacco use in other national sur-
veys, including the Population Assessment 
of Tobacco and Health and the Knowledge 
Panel. 
(9) A determination of the prevalence of 
the following high-risk behaviors among 
high school students, and their relationship, 
if any, to vaping and smoking:

some e-cigarettes, including flavorings used 
in e-cigarettes. 
(13) A determination of a credible estimate 
of the difference in health risks between 
combustible cigarette smoking and vaping, if 
a valid estimate can be made, to inform to-

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
I yield the floor to the distinguished 
Senator from Texas. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am de-
lighted to be here today with my 
friend, the Senator from California, 
with whom I have worked so closely on 
so many issues. We are both members 
of the Senate Committee on the Judici-
ary and the Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence, and it is always a 
pleasure to work with her and her 
staff. 
Today is really an important day. It 
has been long in coming, but finally 
the Senate has now passed legislation 
that requires the same proof-of-age re-
quirement that is needed for tobacco 
products to e-cigarettes and vaping 
products, particularly those that are 
sold over the internet. That is what we 
are focused on. 
Last December, I met a 16-year-old 
young woman named Anna Carey, who 
is one of my personal heroes. She was 
one of the students at her high school 
who became addicted to e-cigarettes. 
E-cigarettes are nicotine delivery de-
vices. The only difference between it 
and smoking a cigarette is the fire, the 
products of combustion, but it is just 
as addictive as cigarettes. 
Anna started experiencing symptoms 
that are uncommon in an otherwise 
healthy 
teenager. 
She 
became 
ex-
tremely 
lethargic. 
She 
experienced 
random and severe chest pains. Two 
initial x rays came back clear, so doc-
tors released her, but her health strug-
gles continued. Eventually, she was ad-
mitted to the hospital and diagnosed 
with chemical-induced pneumonia in 
both of her lungs. 
While I am glad to report that she is 
fully recovered and is now using her 
story to prevent more teens from going 
down the same path, what she told me 
in Fort Worth not that long ago is that 
these e-cigarettes and vaping devices 
are everywhere. They are everywhere 
and can be easily purchased even 
though you are not supposed to use to-
bacco products or nicotine when you 
are under the age of 21. 
So all this bill requires, and it is 
really rather modest—it is unbeliev-
able that it took us this long to get it 
here today, as modest as it is. At the 
time of delivery, if you buy a product 
online, the buyer has to sign and show 
an ID proving their age. It is the same 
requirement you would have if you 
made a physical purchase at a retail es-
tablishment or if you were buying to-
bacco online. For some reason, e-ciga-
rettes and vaping devices have been op-
erating on a different playing field, but 
no longer. That is why I am so pleased 
to be here with Senator FEINSTEIN to 
pass the Preventing Online Sales of E- 
Cigarettes to Children Act. 
To summarize, this legislation would 
put the same safeguards in place for e- 
cigarettes as there are for traditional 
cigarettes purchased online. 
For those who think that we can 
never do anything on a bipartisan 
basis, that we can’t pass laws because 
we are hopelessly polarized and dys-
functional, maybe this will provide 
some source of encouragement to the 
American people, but it also dem-
onstrates that we are doing our best to 
try to protect children’s health, par-
ticularly against addictive substances 
that are delivered through e-cigarettes 
and vaping devices. 
Thank you, Senator FEINSTEIN, for 
your leadership on this and for your 
partnership. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from Texas. I have 
the pleasure of serving with him on the 
Committee on the Judiciary. We have 
been there for a long time, and over the 
years, I have come to have great re-
spect for him. So it is a particular 
asset for me to be able to share the au-
thorship of this bill. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak on the 
Preventing Online Sales of E-Ciga-
rettes to Children Act. Our common-
sense bill would treat e-cigarettes the 
same as traditional cigarettes and 
other tobacco products when it comes 
to purchasing them online. Can you be-
lieve it? E-cigarettes can be purchased 
online by someone 12 years old. There 
is no age requirement. 
This bill would help prevent children 
from illegally obtaining e-cigarettes by 
ensuring 
that 
online 
vendors 
are 
verifying the age of their customers, 
properly labeling packages, and check-
ing identification upon delivery. The 
law exists today, as I stated, for tradi-
tional cigarettes, and there is no rea-
son e-cigarettes should be treated dif-
ferently. 
An annual survey by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention found 
that nearly 5.3 million students are 
using e-cigarettes—over 5 million stu-
dents. 
Besides being illegal, the rate of e- 
cigarette use among teenagers is grow-
ing. In 2019, almost 30 percent of high 
school students reported using an e- 
cigarette in the previous 30 days. That 
is a 50-percent increase from the year 
before. So the popularity of them for 
younger and younger children is going 
up and up. 
According to the U.S. Surgeon Gen-
eral report, the developing adolescent 
brain is uniquely sensitive to nicotine. 
Other studies have shown that children 
exposed to nicotine may be at greater 
risk for experiencing deficits in atten-
tion and cognition, suffering from 
mood disorders, and engaging in drug- 
seeking behavior. These effects may 
continue into adulthood, long after e- 
cigarette use has stopped. 
Further, new research shows that 
young people who use e-cigarettes are 
five times more likely to smoke tradi-
tional cigarettes within 1 year. Clearly, 
it is a come-on to children to graduate 
from the e-cigarette to the real ciga-
rette. 
Given the effects of nicotine on chil-
dren 
and 
the 
likelihood 
of 
their 
transitioning to traditional cigarette 
smoking, it is critical that we close 
any legal loopholes that allows under-
age youth to use e-cigarettes. Studies 
show that one of the easiest ways for 
underage users to purchase e-cigarettes 
is online. Our bipartisan bill would re-
quire e-cigarette retailers to meet the 
same requirements as those that sell 
traditional cigarettes online. 
I believe we have 27 cosponsors equal-
ly divided between our two parties, so 
I am very pleased about that. 
By applying the same safeguards we 
have worked on with online sales of 
traditional cigarettes, our bill would 
ensure that online e-cigarette sellers 
are verifying the age of their cus-
tomers, properly labeling packages, 
and checking identification at deliv-
ery. 
While there is limited research on 
the effects that vaping has had on 
coronavirus 
patients, 
the 
virus 
is 
known to attack the lungs. People with 
underlying conditions are particularly 
susceptible. Last year, we saw a mys-
terious lung illness sicken thousands of 
people that had a history of vaping. So 
it stands to reason that any damage al-
ready caused by vaping may further 
compromise a person’s ability to fight 
off the coronavirus. 
I want to thank Senator CORNYN for 
working with me on this important 
legislation and our 26 colleagues who 
joined as cosponsors to address the epi-
demic of e-cigarette use among Amer-
ican youth. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4177 
July 2, 2020 
HONG KONG 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise 
today with a heaviness in my heart for 
what we have seen happening in the 
last 36 hours in Hong Kong. 
Freedom-loving people in Hong Kong 
for the last 23 years have known basic, 
fundamental 
human 
and 
natural 
rights, and we see the Communist 
Party of China coming in and trying to 
steal their dignity and to steal their 
freedom. They live in real and tangible 
fear of what is going to happen tonight 
and this weekend and next week. 
Yesterday was July 1. July 1 is the 
anniversary 23 years ago of Hong 
Kong’s return to Chinese sovereignty 
under the Sino-British Joint Declara-
tion. Under that agreement, the Com-
munist Party of China made a pledge 
not just to Hongkongers and not just 
to the British but to the watching 
world, and they said that it would 
guarantee—they would guarantee—a 
certain level of autonomy and freedom 
to the Hong Kong community and that 
Hong Kong would not be forced to live 
under the kind of despotism that the 
mainland Chinese are forced to experi-
ence. 
The Communist Party announced to 
the world, in signing that declaration, 
that Hongkongers would be retaining a 
lot 
of 
freedom. 
Well, 
since 
that 
handover in 1997 and, especially since 
2003, when there was another at-
tempted national security law debated, 
the people of Hong Kong have been 
holding pro-democracy protests and 
celebrations every year on the July 1 
holiday. Annually, on July 1, they have 
reminded the world of what the pledge 
was of the Communist Party in that 
agreement of July 1997. 
Yesterday, though, protesting and 
demanding basic human rights and 
freedoms in Hong Kong became a 
crime. Under the new national security 
law, to speak out, to exercise freedom 
of assembly, freedom of speech, or free-
dom of the press issues is considered an 
act of secession, subversion, and ter-
rorism. That is what the new national 
security law that the Chinese have 
forced on Hong Kong stipulates. 
Thousands of people—thousands of 
brave freedom lovers—flooded into the 
streets anyway, and they celebrated 
yesterday that anniversary, and they 
demanded that their representatives 
who have sold them out to Beijing 
would 
continue 
to 
testify 
to 
the 
pledges that were made 23 years ago 
yesterday. At the end of yesterday, 
several hundred of these freedom-lov-
ing protesters were arrested, and 10 of 
them were charged with suspected vio-
lations under the new national security 
law. 
Chinese Government officials now 
seem to be saying that these folks, 
these 10, are going to be extradited to 
mainland China and face their charges 
there. Remember, the protests that we 
have seen in Hong Kong over the last 15 
or 16 months were specifically because 
of 
an 
extradition 
law 
where 
Hongkongers were facing the threat of 
being extradited to mainland China, 
and, supposedly, according to the gov-
ernment officials in Hong Kong, this 
rule, this intended legislation was 
going to be suspended. Well, instead, it 
looks like it is, in fact, connected to 
this new national security law. 
Yesterday really marks the begin-
ning of a new reign of terror in Hong 
Kong. With the implementation of this 
national security law, it is abundantly 
clear that the Communist Party seeks 
to turn Hong Kong into a police state 
no different from Tibet or Xinjiang, 
and the Hong Kong Government no 
longer derives any power from the con-
sent of the people who govern, but 
rather it seeks to rule solely by its co-
operation with the CCP’s security ap-
paratus. 
We are witnessing the signs of the 
coming crackdown. Even before this 
law was signed, democracy activists 
and lawmakers, including Martin Lee, 
who is Hong Kong’s father of democ-
racy and the drafter of Hong Kong’s 
basic law, had already been rounded up. 
Many are expecting the same fate for 
themselves in the coming days. Many 
folks have begun to say goodbye to 
their families in anticipation that they 
are going to be rounded up and hauled 
off into another one of the Chinese re-
education camps or whatever Orwellian 
euphemism we want say for the new 
and potentially coming Auschwitzes. 
Reading over the last several days, I 
am grieved over what are especially 
painful and tear-jerking farewell mes-
sages from many of these democracy 
activists in Hong Kong on social media 
heading up to midnight on June 30, be-
fore the new law took effect. My heart 
ached as I read Joshua Wong tweeting 
out from the Psalms, in particular 
Psalm 23:4: 
I may walk through valleys as dark as 
death, but I won’t be afraid. You are with 
me, and your shepherd’s rod makes me feel 
safe. 
This was mere hours after announc-
ing that he and other Demosisto mem-
bers—a democracy political organiza-
tion—would be closing down their orga-
nizations. 
Pro-democratic parties and pro-inde-
pendence parties, like the Hong Kong 
National Front and Studentlocalism, 
have announced on social media that 
they, too, have disbanded and will try 
to continue their fight for freedom 
from abroad. But if you read the na-
tional security law that the Com-
munist Party is imposing, it looks like 
they 
are 
going 
to 
try 
to 
claim 
extraterritorial 
powers 
over 
Hongkongers in exile regarding free-
dom-of-speech issues in other places in 
the world as also a violation of this 
new, tyrannical, Communist Party Chi-
nese law. 
Videos of restaurant owners and cafe 
owners are up on social media. You can 
see them removing their pro-democ-
racy posters, their signs celebrating 
the freedom that Hong Kong has known 
in the past. These folks are tearing 
down these signs in their own res-
taurants and in their places of assem-
bly because they assume they are like-
ly to be punished under the new na-
tional security law if they keep up 
signs that they have had in their places 
of business where they were com-
muning and breaking bread over the 
past many, many years. This serves as 
a chilling reminder of how the CCP 
rules through fear, which it ultimately 
turns into self-censorship. 
Hong Kong-based Twitter accounts 
have been deleted en masse. Individ-
uals fear for their safety if they con-
tinue to use the platform, and they 
fear retribution for previous tweets 
supporting democracy and accountable 
government, which is just a funda-
mental human thing to be able to say 
or do or talk about or plead for. Like in 
mainland China, Twitter will undoubt-
edly become a tool that is reserved 
only for the oppressors, no longer for 
the oppressed. 
I fear that Joshua’s request—‘‘If my 
voice will not be heard soon, I hope 
that the international community will 
continue to speak up for Hong Kong 
and step up concrete efforts to defend 
our last bit of freedom’’—I fear that 
Joshua’s request will be met with si-
lence. 
I fear that we will fail Ronald Rea-
gan’s challenge to us that we would be 
‘‘staunch in our conviction that free-
dom is not the soul prerogative of the 
lucky few, but [rather, it is] the 
unalienable and universal right of all 
human beings.’’ We are all created in 
God’s image, and our rights come to us 
from God via nature, not because of the 
beneficence of some government. 
I fear that we in the United States 
and those in the international commu-
nity will just simply move on from the 
kind of imminent crackdown in Hong 
Kong that we are going to see that is 
going to have echoes of what happened 
in Tiananmen Square in June of 1989 
and that so many people just decide to 
allow 
the 
Chinese 
Government 
to 
whitewash and pretend never happened. 
We must not allow that to happen. 
I pray that we in this body will live 
up to our convictions and that we will 
speak out about what the Communist 
Party is going to do to the freedom- 
loving people of Hong Kong. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, let 
me make a comment about the re-
marks from my friend from Nebraska. 
It happens that I was in Hong Kong 
when that happened, and I saw the peo-
ple, knowing what was going to happen 
to them after all the promises that 
were made. Everything that we sus-
pected and dreaded has now happened. 
I appreciate the fact that there is 
somebody who cares enough to bring 
all of this to the American people. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, if the 
chairman would yield for just one mo-
ment. 
Mr. INHOFE. Yes. 
Mr. SASSE. I would also like to 
praise the chairman for the work he

does. Flying around the world can be 
hard on bodies. When you have all the 
work you have to do at home and you 
go around the world and you encourage 
freedom-loving people—I know that 
many, many wonderful folks in Taiwan 
who are fearful because of what they 
see happening in Hong Kong know they 
have had an advocate in the chairman 
of the Armed Services Committee for 
many, many years. 
To the people in Taiwan who are also 
scared at this moment, JIM INHOFE is a 
heroic speaker. I just want to thank 
him for the work he has done there. 
Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. I appreciate that. 
It has been a tough time here. I 
would say that he has made my day. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Over the past few days, we have been 
working on this national defense au-
thorization bill. It is one that we pass 
every year and have passed every year 
for 60 years. 
My colleagues have done good work 
on this bill so far. We took requests 
very seriously. We put hundreds of 
them in this bill. We actually did. Over 
700 of the papers and amendments have 
been put in this bill. One of the reasons 
we wanted to do this is because—we 
didn’t used to do it, but we actually did 
this time. A problem that existed last 
year didn’t exist this year. There is re-
sistance on the floor to getting amend-
ments. That resistance has gone now, 
and I think we are going to be able to 
do it. 
This bill was written by the Demo-
crats and Republicans in the U.S. Sen-
ate, and they did a very good job. When 
you stop to consider that we have as 
many—we 
actually 
have 
over 
700 
amendments that are now a part of 
this bill. This was made by the Mem-
bers here, not by any other group. It is 
not the way it has always been done. 
We had a great markup. In fact, our 
markup ended up—I call it unanimous 
because it was passed by 25 to 2, and 
the 2 who voted against it are not big 
on the military anyway. I call it unani-
mous. That is unusual—unusual—to 
get a bill this size to pass unanimously 
out of a committee to the Senate floor. 
This is going to happen today. I feel 
very good about the progress we are 
making. When we come back from this 
Fourth of July recess, we are going to 
be able to finish it, and it should be in 
good shape. 
In a few moments, I will be asking 
for unanimous consent on adoption of 
the managers’ package and to make six 
amendments in order. By my esti-
mation, this is the first time in at least 
the last few years that we have really 
considered and voted on this many in-
dividual amendments on the floor. 
I have to say something about Sen-
ator REED. Sure, we differ on some 
things, but it has always been that we 
have reached agreement on virtually 
every issue. I was glad we had agree-
ment on amendments. We were pushing 
hard to have even many more amend-
ments. We wanted to consider as many 
as possible. We wanted every Member 
to have a say in this bill, and that is 
exactly what happened. I am glad we 
were able to reach a bipartisan path 
forward to complete consideration of 
this bill right after the recess, and that 
is exactly what we are going to do. 
I have gone over a lot of the reasons 
this bill is so important over the past 
week, so I will keep it simple. Here is 
why we need to pass this bill: 
First of all, it gives our troops a 
needed and deserved raise. It is out 
there. 
It authorizes more than 30 kinds of 
special pay for our troops at various 
levels of hazard—things that haven’t 
been done before. 
It makes sure our military families— 
this is the big thing. I have a very close 
friend in here who was talking about 
the fact that—on the floor—the main 
problem we are facing in our Nation as 
a threat is China and Russia. He made 
the comment and observation that, 
yet, we spend more on the military 
than the two of them put together. 
That is true, but I did want to remind 
him—and I did on the floor yesterday— 
that there is a reason for that. The rea-
son for that is the most expensive 
thing we have in the military that we 
deal with every year are people. We 
take care of people. 
I remember last year that one of the 
main thrusts of our bill was to get all 
of those housing things that were 
privatized 10 years before and that 
hadn’t been performing very well—to 
take care of our troops and their fami-
lies. We spent time doing that. You 
take a Communist country like China 
or Russia—they don’t care about the 
troops. They give them a gun and say: 
Go out and kill people. No wonder we 
have to spend more. That is the reason 
we are going to continue to do that, 
and this bill does that. 
There are countries out there that 
hate everything America stands for 
and want to do us harm. We know that 
is right. I sometimes get tickled when 
I hear people talking about, well, we 
don’t want to do this because that is 
going to upset them. We don’t want to 
keep Gitmo open because that might 
upset the terrorists. Well, welcome to 
the real world. 
So this gives our troops the equip-
ment, the training, and the resources 
they need to defend this Nation. 
I never want to put ourselves in the 
position where we have a fair fight in 
America. We don’t want fair fights. We 
want to go into combat with a clear ad-
vantage over our adversaries, and this 
bill does that. 
It makes sure that the Pentagon is 
situated to support our troops wher-
ever they are, but it also protects tax-
payer dollars and ensures account-
ability to the taxpayers. That is very 
important, and this bill does that. 
This bill also does a lot of good 
things we all support. That is why we 
are passing the bill today. It is a no- 
brainer. It is not a matter of if we are 
going to pass it; it is a matter of when. 
It is now down to the hours. It will be 
set up so that when we come back from 
the recess, we will be able to pass this 
bill. 
Keep in mind, we pass it, and that is 
not the end because the House has to 
pass their bills, and, of course, then the 
President will sign the bill. We go into 
conference with the House and the Sen-
ate, and before the President signs the 
bill, we have to have not just a con-
ference, but very likely it will go to 
the Big Four. If it does that, that is an-
other process. Very likely, it could be 
November when we actually end up 
passing this bill. Our absolute deadline 
has always been December 31. We will 
be well in advance of that. 
I know the President has strong feel-
ings about one of the provisions of the 
bill. He says if that is in there, he will 
veto the bill. We all know what that is. 
It is controversial. It is the Warren 
amendment that was put in. I have to 
say this: All but one Republican oppose 
that. I have to say that so people will 
hear it and understand it because that 
is true. 
Anyway, passing the bill is not a 
matter of if; it is going to pass. This is 
a very good bill. It is a must-pass bill. 
One of the things that happen with a 
must-pass bill is that everyone who 
can’t get their bills on other interest 
areas passed—they know this bill is 
going to pass, so they try to put in 
amendments. We have taken a lot of 
the amendments that have nothing to 
do with defense, but nonetheless we 
know it is necessary. It has been nec-
essary for 60 years. This is nothing 
new. 
I would remind our colleagues that 
we have a long way to go yet. We will 
make sure that the conference report is 
a bipartisan one when we get to that 
point so that both parties can support 
it. It is exactly what we have right 
now. I have to say, with Senator 
REED—we very carefully weighed our 
portions of the bill, as well as amend-
ments, to make sure we were fair to 
both sides—both the Republicans and 
Democrats—and that is the product we 
have in front of us. 
From the brave patriots who fought 
for our Nation nearly 250 years ago to 
the 2.1 million who serve today, this 
bill is by them and for them. 
This weekend, as you celebrate Inde-
pendence Day, think about what this 
holiday stands for. Think about what it 
takes to protect the freedoms we cele-
brate. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
this bill will give our troops what they 
need. The bill will make American 
families safer and will enable us to 
stand up for our democratic values 
around the world. We will be passing 
this bill and will be very proud of it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

S4179 
July 2, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
HONG KONG AUTONOMY ACT 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I am 
here on the Senate floor with my col-
league from Maryland. I am here this 
morning, in part, to condemn the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s actions, their 
efforts to swallow Hong Kong into the 
mainland and silence the dissent of the 
people of Hong Kong, but I am also 
here to do something about that. 
For decades, Hong Kong has been one 
of the most successful, thriving soci-
eties on the planet. An indispensable 
part of their success has been their 
freedom. Hong Kong has enjoyed a vi-
brant free press, free speech, freedom 
to worship. They have had an inde-
pendent 
judiciary 
and 
a 
partially 
democratic 
electoral 
representative 
system of government for a long time 
now. 
Hong Kong is one of the freest places 
in Asia and, because of these freedoms 
and the Hong Kong people’s natural en-
trepreneurial spirit, Hong Kong is just 
one of the most successful and vibrant 
cities there has ever been. 
Yet for years—maybe because of 
this—the Chinese Communist Party 
has pursued a systematic campaign to 
snuff out these basic freedoms in Hong 
Kong and bring the Hongkongers who 
live there into line. The intensity of 
the Chinese Communist Party’s aggres-
sion appears to be growing by the day. 
Their campaign shouldn’t be very 
surprising. Just look at the recent ac-
tions: the genocidal action toward the 
Uighurs in Xinjiang or the aggressive 
action toward neighboring countries in 
the South China Sea—or toward the 
entire world, since the COVID–19 virus 
was first detected in Wuhan and the 
Chinese Government lied to us about 
its nature. 
Fundamental principles, such as free-
dom and transparency, the just rule of 
law—these ideas are entirely antithet-
ical to the core of the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s mission. I think that, 
several years from now, we are going to 
look back on July 1 of 2020 as a mile-
stone in the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s aggression and hostility toward 
Hong Kong. 
Yesterday was the first day that the 
Chinese Communist Party’s new so- 
called national security law went into 
effect. News reports described the law 
as ‘‘tailor-made to bring Hong Kong’s 
massive pro-democracy movement to 
heel.’’ 
This picture was taken within the 
last 48 hours—thousands and thousands 
of people of Hong Kong taking to the 
streets to simply demand their free-
doms—peacefully—to protest, to insist 
that they continue to have the free-
doms that help make their society such 
a great society. 
Tragically, 300 of these people were 
arrested last night simply because they 
were protesting the Chinese Com-
munist Party. Some of the arrests were 
made because Hongkongers possessed 
items that called for Hong Kong’s inde-
pendence. That is right—people ar-
rested simply for holding a sign, ar-
rested for holding a flag. Among them 
was a 15-year-old girl—a 15-year-old 
girl. Her crime: She held a flag that 
said ‘‘Hong Kong independence.’’ An-
other was a 19-year-old young man. His 
crime was that he had a pro-democracy 
sticker on his phone. Imagine—imagine 
the nerve of wanting to have self-deter-
mination and expressing that with a 
sticker on your phone. So he was ar-
rested. 
His parents attempted to visit their 
son in jail and bring him dinner, and 
the police refused their visit. It is not 
at all clear if this young man will be 
able to get out even on bail. 
So the Chinese Communist Party has 
very rapidly started enforcing this new 
law, and I think it is because they real-
ize what is at stake. They know that 
the people of Hong Kong fervently be-
lieve in the importance of an open and 
free society. They believe in and they 
want the ability to practice liberal val-
ues, and they want a system of trans-
parent, accountable government, one 
that is elected by and responsive to the 
people. 
See, the vision of the people of Hong 
Kong for their own city, for their soci-
ety, is anathema to the Chinese Com-
munist Party because the Chinese 
Communist Party’s deepest fear is that 
mainland Chinese citizens will demand 
the freedoms that Hongkongers enjoy, 
and that quest for freedom on the 
mainland would pose an unacceptable 
risk to the authoritarian control of the 
Communist regime. 
So the Chinese Communist Party is 
cracking down. We have been wit-
nessing it just in recent hours. This 
new so-called national security law was 
unilaterally imposed on the people of 
Hong Kong without any input from the 
people of Hong Kong, and that is in di-
rect contravention to Chinese commit-
ments to Hong Kong and the inter-
national community. The law was also 
purposefully written in a very vague 
and ambiguous manner, designed to es-
sentially criminalize any behavior or 
speech on the part of a resident of 
Hong Kong that the Chinese Com-
munist Party does not approve of. 
Now, the law may be ambiguous, but 
the message behind it is not. If a 19- 
year-old can now be imprisoned for 
having a sticker on his phone or a 15- 
year-old girl can be imprisoned for hav-
ing a flag, then no one is safe, and that 
is the message that Beijing wants to 
send to the people of Hong Kong: We 
can arrest you. We can imprison you if 
you misbehave. So think twice about 
what you say, where you go, with 
whom you meet, what you read, what 
you write. Maybe even think twice 
about what you think. 
This law, sadly, looks like it means 
the end of Hong Kong’s autonomy and 
the freedoms which underpin its social 
and economic vibrancy. And we are 
seeing the effects: As I said, hundreds 
of arrests that occurred just yesterday 
as tens of thousands of courageous 
Hongkongers—here we see some of 
them—poured into the streets to shout 
and chant and demonstrate peacefully, 
to tell the Chinese Communist Party 
that they are not going to back down. 
We have also seen Hongkongers who 
have been forced to scrub their social 
media history, booksellers who were 
intending to remove books from their 
shelves, Hong Kong pro-democracy po-
litical figures saying that they have to 
lessen their activism and rethink their 
strategy. 
How can you blame them? How can 
you blame them? They could face years 
in prison if the Hong Kong authorities, 
at the bidding of the people in Beijing, 
choose to target them. 
I think we can fully expect inde-
pendent media voices in Hong Kong to 
be shuttered and Beijing’s censorship 
and surveillance apparatus to flourish 
in the coming months and years. 
The fact is, Hong Kong’s vibrancy is 
being throttled by the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
So I am on the Senate floor today to 
request passage of a piece of legislation 
that responds to this. I am pleased to 
report it has already received unani-
mous support from both Chambers of 
Congress. I introduced this legislation 
with my colleague Senator VAN HOL-
LEN of Maryland to create real pen-
alties on those responsible for this 
campaign by the Chinese Communist 
Party to end Hong Kong’s free way of 
life. 
It is called the Hong Kong Autonomy 
Act, and the bill would impose manda-
tory sanctions on anyone involved in 
taking action to attack the basic free-
doms that were promised to the people 
of Hong Kong. 
Critically, our legislation also takes 
another step. It penalizes banks that 
choose to finance the erosion of Hong 
Kong’s autonomy, banks that would 
put marginal profits ahead of the basic 
human rights of the people of Hong 
Kong. 
I am really pleased that we are here 
this morning. I think we are on the 
verge of sending this legislation to the 
President’s 
desk 
because 
America 
needs to take meaningful steps like 
this to push back on the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
We should remember that this ag-
gression toward Hong Kong is not lim-
ited to Hong Kong. The Chinese Com-
munist Party is intent to spread its in-
fluence and power worldwide, and in 
the process, it is meant to simulta-
neously undermine and challenge free 
and open societies. I should point out 
that the spread of the Chinese Com-
munist Party influence around the 
world poses a very real threat to us, to 
Americans, to our national and eco-
nomic interests. 
That is part of why the Hong Kong 
Autonomy Act is so important. It is 
not only an effort to shield freedom- 
loving Hongkongers from this con-
tinuing escalation of aggression by the

July 2, 2020 
Chinese Communists, but the bill is a 
larger signal to China. It is a message 
that the United States and the free 
world are no longer willing to look past 
some of the worst behavior that has 
been occurring. It is a message that 
our patience has run out. 
China is being warned to expect stiff 
resistance—stiff resistance to stealing 
American 
intellectual 
property, 
to 
committing genocide against religious 
minorities like the Uighurs, to milita-
rizing artificial islands and infringing 
on other nations’ sovereign waters, and 
trampling on the basic freedoms of the 
people of Hong Kong. 
I could go on, but suffice it to say 
that this is occurring in the context of 
a great battle—the great battle about 
what model the world is going to pur-
sue. Will the citizens of the United 
States and other democratic nations 
around the world continue to foster the 
liberal democratic model that spread 
around the world after World War II, 
with open societies, the just rule of 
law, greater economic freedom under-
pinned by respect for private property, 
basic human rights like the freedom of 
speech and the freedom of a free press 
and the freedom to worship? 
All of the prosperity and the ele-
vation of human dignity that comes 
from human freedom and democratic 
values from our model—that is the 
model that is up against the dark shad-
ows of the authoritarian governments 
that are constantly pushing to system-
atically erode, corrode, and warp the 
values and freedoms that we cherish. 
Through this bill, the U.S. Senate 
makes clear which side we are on. 
At this point, I would like to yield to 
the Senator from Maryland. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
want to salute my friend and colleague, 
the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. 
TOOMEY, for his remarks and for his 
leadership on this very vital issue of 
standing up for the rights and freedom 
of people in Hong Kong and, as he said, 
sending a signal to others around the 
world who would seek to stamp out 
human rights and political freedom. 
When Senator TOOMEY and I saw that 
the Chinese Communist Party was tak-
ing its more recent steps to crack down 
on freedom in Hong Kong, we intro-
duced the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. 
That act just passed the U.S. Senate 
unanimously last week and was sent to 
the House of Representatives. 
This is a very fast turnaround from 
either of the Chambers in the U.S. Con-
gress. I want to thank Speaker PELOSI 
and her Republican partner and all the 
Democrats and Republicans in the 
House of Representatives for coming 
together so quickly on this legislation. 
The legislation before us made a 
technical fix to the bill that Senator 
TOOMEY and I introduced in which this 
Senate passed out last week a tech-
nical fix to comply with the constitu-
tional requirements as to where a bill 
that might generate revenue begins. 
With that technical fix, Speaker 
PELOSI and the Republican leadership 
sent it right back. Why did they send it 
right back so quickly? Because this is 
an urgent moment. In fact, our timing 
could not be more critical. On Tuesday, 
President Xi imposed a national secu-
rity law on Hong Kong by fiat. It was 
only after the law was passed that Bei-
jing unveiled its provisions. Even Hong 
Kong’s Chief Executive and President 
Xi loyalist, Carrie Lam, said she hadn’t 
been allowed to see a draft before the 
law’s passage. 
As Senator TOOMEY indicated, this 
law is written broadly enough that it 
will criminalize speech and peaceful as-
sembly. Anybody who publishes anti- 
Beijing viewpoints could be punished 
by life in prison. Saying anything seen 
to be undermining the ruling Com-
munist Party’s authority would be a 
violation. 
This is consistent with mainland Chi-
na’s approach, which has virtually 
eliminated independent journalism and 
severely restricted NGOs. 
Here are some highlights of the law 
that was just passed—I should say, im-
posed. It now mandates that the Hong 
Kong Government undertake ‘‘national 
security education’’ in school, social 
organizations, and media outlets. The 
law mandates that anyone entering 
public office in Hong Kong swear alle-
giance to Beijing. 
What is more, the law applies to any-
one, anywhere. It can even apply to of-
fenses committed outside the region by 
a person who is not a permanent resi-
dent of the region. That means a U.S. 
citizen penning an editorial that ar-
gues for sanctions against China could 
technically fall afoul of the new law for 
‘‘inciting 
hatred’’ 
against 
Beijing. 
Legal experts believe this is even 
broader than the Chinese criminal law 
applied in mainland China. 
Senator TOOMEY said, despite this— 
despite this threat, despite passage of a 
law that would punish people for up to 
life imprisonment for expressing their 
views, thousands of protesters took to 
the streets yesterday and staged the 
largest rally in Hong Kong this year. 
Hundreds of Hong Kong police officers 
moved in swiftly to quash dissent and 
implement the law. Police fired tear 
gas, pepper spray, and water cannons 
to disperse the protesters. 
The police then issued a statement 
that noted some protesters were chant-
ing ‘‘Hong Kong independence, the only 
way out.’’ The statement said such slo-
gans are ‘‘suspected to be inciting or 
abetting others to commit secession’’ 
and may violate the new law. 
The United States must stand with 
the people of Hong Kong. That is what 
this bill says. This bill says we stand 
with the people of Hong Kong. 
As Senator TOOMEY
indicated, it 
would impose mandatory sanctions on 
individuals in firms who violate Chi-
na’s obligations to the people of Hong 
Kong under the joint declaration and 
the basic law—rights of freedom of 
speech and equality before the law, 
freedom of association, and the right 
from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, de-
tention, and imprisonment. It goes be-
yond that to impose mandatory sanc-
tions on banks that do business with 
individuals who are complicit in under-
mining these freedoms and the rights 
of the people of Hong Kong. 
I am glad we acted quickly. As you 
can see, the Government of China is 
moving by the day to squash the rights 
and freedoms of the people of Hong 
Kong. We need to move with urgency 
to send a statement that we stand with 
the people of Hong Kong. 
In a moment, I am going to be join-
ing my colleague, Senator TOOMEY, in 
asking for unanimous consent. Before I 
turn it back over to him, let me just 
say, assuming we get that—and it 
looks like we will—I hope President 
Trump will sign this immediately—im-
mediately. 
As a country, Republicans and Demo-
crats together need to send a strong 
signal that we will not stand for the 
actions of Beijing, undermining their 
own 
agreements—agreements 
under 
international law, which 
they 
are 
bound to, and we will not stand still in 
silence and do nothing while they 
crack down on freedom in Hong Kong. 
I yield to Senator TOOMEY
from 
Pennsylvania. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, again, 
let me stress how grateful I am for the 
passionate, persuasive, and very effec-
tive advocacy of Senator VAN HOLLEN 
throughout this entire effort. I am very 
grateful to him, as I am to other col-
leagues who helped make this happen. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of H.R. 
7440, which was received from the 
House. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 7440) to impose sanctions with 
respect to foreign persons involved in the 
erosion of certain obligations of China with 
respect to Hong Kong, and for other pur-
poses. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 7440) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time,

OFFICE OF NET ASSESSMENT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
have made a career in the Senate fight-
ing against government waste, fraud, 
and abuse. Most recently, I have found 
this waste in an office within the De-
partment of Defense called the Office 
of Net Assessment. Its purpose is to 
produce an annual net assessment, 
which is a long-term look at our mili-
tary’s capabilities and those of our 
greatest adversaries. 
I am here to say to my colleagues 
that that office has lost its way. When 
I began a review of Stefan Halper’s con-
tracting work at the Office of Net As-
sessment, something didn’t look right. 
So I asked the inspector general to 
look into it. 
For those who are unaware, Stefan 
Halper was a central figure in the de-
bunked Russia collusion investigation. 
Stefan Halper secretly recorded Trump 
campaign 
officials 
during 
Crossfire 
Hurricane. Halper also received over a 
million taxpayer dollars from the Of-
fice of Net Assessment for several ‘‘re-
search’’ projects, but the inspector gen-
eral found some problems with that 
contract. 
The Office of Net Assessment didn’t 
require Halper to submit evidence that 
he actually talked to the people he 
cited in his work, which included Rus-
sian intelligence officers. 
Secondly, the Office of Net Assess-
ment couldn’t provide sufficient docu-
mentation that Halper conducted all of 
his work in accordance with the law. 
And, three, the Office of Net Assess-
ment didn’t maintain sufficient docu-
mentation to comply with all Federal 
contracting requirements and Office of 
Management and Budget guidelines. 
The inspector general also found that 
these problems were not unique just to 
Halper’s contracts, which indicates, 
then, systemic issues within the Office 
of Net Assessment. Moreover, it has 
been reported that some of the individ-
uals that Halper cited as sources in his 
research have denied contributing to 
Halper’s work. 
Oddly, Office of National Assessment 
Director James Baker has repeatedly 
told me that Halper’s deliverables were 
‘‘high quality’’ and ‘‘conformed to the 
requirements set forth in the con-
tract.’’ 
What planet does the Office of Net 
Assessment live on? 
The office spends almost $20 million 
a year of taxpayers’ money every year. 
Yet according to a deposition of Mr. 
Baker, the Office of Net Assessment 
hasn’t performed any annual net as-
sessments since 2007. 
A net assessment is the Office of Net 
Assessment’s core mission. It even says 
so in the title. Its purpose of doing net 
assessments got lost along the way. 
Moreover, after I began my oversight 
work at the Office of Net Assessment, a 
Department of Defense directive regu-
lating the Office of Net Assessment was 
changed to provide cover for the unit’s 
lackluster performance. Isn’t that con-
venient? When your work is to do net 
assessment and you have been in exist-
ence for decades, and since 2007, you 
haven’t been doing your net assess-
ment, you issue a directive changing 
what the purpose of the Office of Net 
Assessment is all about. They did it 
pretty simply. 
On April 14, 2020, the word ‘‘shall’’ 
was removed from the December 23, 
2009, version of the directive that re-
quired the Office of Net Assessment to 
produce what their title said—‘‘net as-
sessments.’’ 
The 
new 
version 
also 
changed the Office of Net Assessment’s 
research scope to generic research, 
seemingly untethered to a net assess-
ment—how convenient. 
This swamp needs to be drained. 
Last week, I introduced an amend-
ment to the Defense bill that does sev-
eral things. First, it reduces Office of 
Net Assessment’s budget to $10 million 
a year instead of $20 million a year. 
Second, my amendment requires the 
Secretary of Defense to create a com-
prehensive plan to ensure that the Of-
fice of Net Assessment performs what 
the title of the agency says it is sup-
posed to do—an annual net assess-
ment—and complies, at the same time, 
with every dollar they get with Federal 
contracting requirements. This would 
take it back to the reason why it was 
first created decades ago. 
Third, the amendment would require 
the Department of Defense inspector 
general to study and report on the Of-
fice of Net Assessment’s contracting 
failures and determine if the net as-
sessment can be done for less than $10 
million. 
And, fourth, it requires the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to perform 
an audit of the effectiveness of the 
comprehensive plan. 
Right now, it is pretty clear that the 
Office of Net Assessment lacks leader-
ship and discipline, and it is also pretty 
clear that it has wasted tens of mil-
lions of dollars over the years. Con-
gress must take a stand. That is why I 
am here to encourage my colleagues to 
support my amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 645 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, before we 
break for the Fourth of July recess, I 
think it is important for the Senate to 
go on record condemning the rising 
tide of mob violence that we see across 
the country and the increasingly prev-
alent mob mentality that is fueling it. 
The violence struck home for me this 
week when one of my constituents was 
shot after an armed mob surrounded 
his vehicle in Provo, UT. 
This resolution is not controversial. 
Even in these divisive times, it is 
something, I think, we can all agree 
on, and I want to read through some 
highlights right now so you get a feel 
for it. 
The United States of America was founded 
in 1776 on universal principles of freedom, 
justice, and human equality. 
Throughout our nation’s history, Ameri-
cans have struggled to realize those ideals 
. . . but nonetheless [have made] greater 
progress toward them than any [other] na-
tion on earth. 
[The United States is a diverse nation] 
committed to cultivating respect, friendship, 
and justice across all such differences, and 
protecting the God-given equal rights of all 
Americans under the law. 
America’s law enforcement officers do an 
extremely difficult job extremely well, and 
despite the inexcusable misconduct of some, 
the overwhelming majority of such officers 
are honest, courageous, patriotic, and right-
fully honored public servants. 
In recent weeks, people across the United 
States have organized legitimate, peaceful, 
constitutionally protected demonstrations 
against instances of police brutality and ra-
cial inequality. 
[Some of these Americans have organized 
these peaceful protests, asking for investiga-
tions into serious problems meriting inves-
tigation and reform.] 
Some Americans, unsatisfied with peaceful 
and positive demonstrations, have instigated 
and indulged in mob violence and criminal 
property destruction, not in service of any 
. . . coherent cause, but simply as an arro-
gant, bullying tantrum of self-righteous 
illiberalism and rage. 
These mobs have demonstrated not only 
contempt for public safety (as evidenced, 
among other crimes, by an unprovoked phys-
ical assault on a Wisconsin State Senator 
and the [more recent] shooting of a motorist 
in Provo, Utah) and common decency (as evi-
denced by their . . . obscene berating of law 
enforcement officers standing their posts to 
protect their communities), but also their 
manifest ignorance and historical illiteracy 
(as evidenced by their destruction of public 
memorials to historical heroes like Ulysses 
S. Grant, St. Junipero Serra, Miguel Cer-
vantes, George Washington, Hans Christian 
Heg, and a reported plan to target a statue of 
Abraham Lincoln financed in 1876 entirely by 
private donations from freed African-Amer-
ican slaves). 
It is the sense of the Senate that the rising 
tide of vandalism, mob violence, and the mob 
mentality that feeds it—including its cruel 
and intolerant ‘‘cancel culture’’—should be 
condemned by all Americans; [that] peaceful 
demonstrations and mob violence are dif-
ferent in kind; [that] physical assault and

property destruction are not forms of polit-
ical speech but violent crimes whose per-
petrators should be prosecuted to the full ex-
tent of the law; and [that] the innocent law 
enforcement officers, public officials, and 
private citizens who suffer the mob’s vio-
lence and endure its scorn while protecting 
our communities from them deserve [every 
American’s thanks and appreciation]. 
As I say, it is very straightforward. 
As we saw in Seattle this week, these 
mobs are not going to stop until they 
are stopped. A nonbinding resolution is 
the tiniest first step of a response—the 
merest exercise of the Senate’s atro-
phied institutional muscles. We need to 
do much, much more, and I look for-
ward to working with colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to develop the 
legislation to do it. 
Yet, in this divided political mo-
ment, heading into the 244th birthday 
of the greatest, freest, most tolerant, 
and prosperous nation the world has 
ever known, I think showing that Sen-
ate Republicans and showing that Sen-
ate Democrats can work together and 
speak with one voice against woke mob 
violence and in defense of equal justice 
and civic peace would be a welcomed 
step. 
Therefore, Mr. President, as if in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res. 645, submitted 
earlier today. I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be agreed to; that 
the preamble be agreed to; and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, look, there 
are nuggets in the Senator’s resolu-
tion—certainly recognizing that, over-
whelmingly, law enforcement does an 
honorable and valuable job in our soci-
ety. It is a tough job. The bad ones 
make it difficult for all the good ones. 
I would agree with that. But I have to 
be honest with you. There are also ele-
ments of this resolution that are not as 
straightforward 
as 
the 
gentleman 
would have you believe. 
First of all, the very first paragraph 
says that we were founded on universal 
principles of freedom, justice, and 
human equality. Of course, slavery ex-
isted at the time. There is no mention 
of America’s original sin, which is slav-
ery. Certainly we cannot think of slav-
ery as human equality. 
Then, to go on to suggest in his third 
paragraph that we are morally com-
mitted to justice ‘‘across all such dif-
ferences, and protecting the God-given 
rights of all Americans under the law,’’ 
well, I can tell you, in my home State 
of New Jersey and across the Nation, 
there are many Americans who clearly 
do not believe that we are morally 
committed to justice across all such 
differences. As a matter of fact, we saw 
that in how the majority responded to 
the George Floyd death and others 
across the Nation—a lot of rhetoric; 
very little reform. So we would be 
hard-pressed to believe that paragraph 
has legitimacy as well. 
Then the resolution reeks of suprem-
acy, self-righteous illiberalism, mani-
fest ignorance, and historical illit-
eracy. It reeks of a supremacist view: 
We know better. 
Even with all of those problems and 
even with the fact that it has come at 
the last moment, there was no effort to 
work with anybody to offer maybe a bi-
partisan resolution that would capture 
all of this. Even though it seeks to 
mischaracterize overwhelmingly what 
has been the peaceful protests of people 
in the Nation, I would consider not ob-
jecting to the Senator’s request if he 
also recognized and added to his resolu-
tion the fact that we have a President 
of the United States who ultimately 
provokes 
inciteful 
language 
and 
inciteful violence. 
I mean, we have a President who 
retweets a video of people saying 
‘‘White power. White power.’’ 
We have a President who retweets a 
video of White citizens with arms, 
pointing them at peaceful protesters 
who—at the end of the day, it is their 
right to peacefully protest. 
We have a President who said that 
there were good people on all sides, in-
cluding the White supremacists, in 
Charleston. 
We have a President who used vio-
lence—the armed force of the State and 
violence against peaceful protesters in 
Lafayette Park, who were doing none 
of what the Senator suggests in his res-
olution. 
Despite all of that, if the Senator 
would modify his request to include the 
following language: Insert at the end of 
his last line, line 15, section—make a 
new section (5): ‘‘Our elected officials, 
especially the President of the United 
States, should not incite violence or le-
gitimize those who engage in hate- 
fueled acts,’’ I would consider allowing 
the Senator’s resolution to move for-
ward and not objecting to it. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). Does the Senator so modify his 
request? 
Mr. LEE. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, as I look at the language proposed 
by my colleague from New Jersey, I 
would accept the rest of it except for 
the words ‘‘especially the President of 
the United States.’’ The rest of it is 
unobjectionable. 
The point here is that without point-
ing to any one specific individual, we 
should all be able to acknowledge, as a 
sense of the Senate, that we do hold 
these truths as self-evident; that our 
country was founded on these very 
strong ideals. Even if, as the resolution 
itself acknowledges, we have failed at 
times to live up to them, we have still 
done it. 
So I would accept the modification 
but only with the removal of the words 
‘‘especially the President of the United 
States.’’ 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is 
especially the President of the United 
States—the person who leads our Na-
tion—who should be a unifying force, 
not one who incites violence; therefore, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, what is hap-
pening here? This is the U.S. Senate. 
Just so everyone is clear about the bat 
guano-inspired insanity we just wit-
nessed, I just proposed a nonbinding 
resolution condemning mob violence, 
and Senate Democrats objected. I don’t 
know whether to be outraged or embar-
rassed for them. This isn’t even a bill; 
it is just a statement that says mob vi-
olence is bad. Democrats can’t say mob 
violence is bad without simultaneously 
taking a jab at the President of the 
United States? 
By the way, what about the mayor of 
Seattle? What about the city council of 
Minnesota? What about the countless 
other people who have perpetuated or 
enabled or facilitated or coddled mob 
violence across the country? 
It is one of the reasons why we are 
not going to engage in this task of 
making it a political tit-for-tat. It is 
not that. People are being shot. Busi-
nesses 
are 
being 
looted. 
Innocent 
Americans are being attacked and 
threatened. Lives are being ruined. 
Communities 
are 
burning—literally 
burning. 
So whose side are you on? This reso-
lution was designed to be unifying. It 
avoided controversial subjects. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, may I 
ask the Presiding Officer to remind us 
of rule XIX. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair will remind Senators of both par-
ties that rule XIX provides that no 
Senator in debate shall directly or in-
directly, by any form of words, impute 
to another Senator or to other Sen-
ators any conduct or motive unworthy 
or unbecoming of a Senator. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the resolu-
tion was designed to be unifying. It 
avoided controversial subjects. All it 
asks of us is basic dignity and respect. 
As long as we are on the topic of rule 
XIX, it is unbecoming to accuse a col-
league of using language that is su-
premacy simply by reflecting on lan-
guage in the Declaration of Independ-
ence, simply by reflecting on language 
that acknowledges the incivility and 
intolerability of mob violence. But ap-
parently that is too much to ask today. 
I guess we should be thankful for clar-
ity. And now we know. We don’t have 
to ask. They told us how they feel 
about this resolution. 
You can’t really oppose this, it seems 
to me, without being on the side of the 
mobs, of mob violence, of mob men-
tality, of cruelty and intolerance and 
terror. Now we understand what this 
resolution is about. I don’t think one 
can oppose this without being com-
fortable with those things. These mobs

are not progressive. These mobs are 
not enlightened. These mobs are not 
edgy. They are not hip. They are 
frauds. They are dim-witted, phony, 
drama addicts—— 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, par-
liamentary inquiry. Is this line not in 
direct violation of rule XIX? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair concludes that pointing out that 
mob violence is dangerous to our Na-
tion is not contrary to rule XIX or any 
other rule of the Senate. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, fur-
ther parliamentary inquiry. There is 
not a question of mob violence. The 
question is that imputing to Members 
who did not agree with the framework 
and language of this resolution that 
they are supporting mob violence—that 
must be in violation of rule XIX if this 
is going to be a deliberative body. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is more than entitled to express 
his views in the course of debate, but 
other Senators will likewise express 
their views in the course of debate. 
Mr. LEE. Failed by an education sys-
tem and addled by a social media cul-
ture that taught them to be victims in-
stead of citizens. A privileged, self-ab-
sorbed crime syndicate with participa-
tion-trophy graduate degrees, trying to 
find meaning in empty lives by de-
stroying things that other Americans 
have spent honest, productive lives 
building. 
Today 
we 
learned—today 
we 
learned—that there are those who are 
comfortable with this. There are those 
who are at least not inclined to vote 
for this resolution, which simply con-
demns mob violence. Now we know. 
Now we know. 
I want all my colleagues to know 
that when we return from recess, we 
are coming back to the Senate floor 
and we are not just going to be debat-
ing nonbinding resolutions. It is long 
past time to expose the shiftless idiocy 
of 
the 
anti-American, 
anti-science, 
anti-establishment, 
anti-Constitution 
mob and remove their snouts from the 
Federal trough. 
Colleges and universities that punish 
free speech and discriminate against 
conservative and religious students; 
city councils that defund their police 
departments and refuse to protect pub-
lic safety; States that force doctors to 
mutilate confused children without 
their parents’ consent; school districts 
that embrace the ahistorical nonsense 
of the 1619 Project; the smug, sneering 
privilege of all of the above and much 
more—the whole garbage fire that is 
the 
so-called 
‘‘woke’’ 
ideology—de-
pends on Federal money. 
The mob hates America on America’s 
dime. It is time to cut off their allow-
ance. I think the American people 
would be very interested to know who 
stands for them and who stands for 
subsidizing the mob. I intend to show 
them. 
Mr. President, this debate is not end-
ing today; it is only the beginning. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we 
have learned something today. We have 
learned that my colleagues are unwill-
ing to call out the President of the 
United States when the President of 
the United States uses language that 
incites violence; says that White su-
premacists in Charleston are as good as 
everybody else; retweets a video of 
White 
Americans 
saying 
‘‘White 
power;’’ retweets a video of two indi-
viduals with guns pointed at peaceful 
protesters; uses the force of the State 
to clear out peaceful protesters in La-
fayette Park; goes and says, in fact, 
‘‘when the looting starts, the shooting 
starts.’’ That has a historical context 
to it, and the ‘‘liberate Virginia. It is 
under siege,’’ and so, so much more. 
So, yes, I look forward to that debate 
because I have legislation to deal with 
the rising tide of White supremacists’ 
actions that, at the end of the day, 
have even been recognized by some of 
our law enforcement entities as a grow-
ing national threat. So I look forward 
to having that debate, look forward to 
having that legislation on the floor, 
and we will see how our colleagues act 
then. 
But it is totally unacceptable to cast 
aspersions that do not equal those of 
the person who leads our country, and 
we should recognize that. What it 
shows me is that I guess President 
Trump is right—he could shoot some-
one on Fifth Avenue and get away with 
it, and certainly my colleagues here 
would not hold him responsible. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, all I asked 
in my counter was that we remove the 
words ‘‘especially the President of the 
United States.’’ Why? Because it is dif-
ferent than the entire approach taken 
by the resolution. 
As long as we are calling each other 
out on casting aspersions on each oth-
er’s intentions, no one’s intention here 
is to shield anyone from anything, as 
evidenced by the fact that, as my pro-
posed modification would have pro-
vided, it would have said that ‘‘our 
elected officials should not incite vio-
lence or legitimize those who engage in 
hate-fueled acts.’’ Last I checked, the 
President of the United States was and 
is an elected official. This would apply 
to him. My counter in no way insu-
lated—not him, not any elected offi-
cial, not any of us from this resolution, 
which simply condemns mob violence. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I will be 
very quick. I understand we have work 
to do on the Defense authorization and 
the vote coming up, but I am glad the 
majority leader is on the floor, and I 
am glad so many Members are on the 
floor. 
We have a problem in this institution 
of the uneven enforcement of rule XIX, 
and it is hurting this body. 
I have just by happenstance been on 
the floor for various violations being 
called by the Presiding Officer, usually 
with the advice of the Parliamen-
tarian. It is very clear to me that the 
rules are not being applied equally to 
each party, and I think that is some-
thing we are going to have to wrestle 
with if we are going to continue to be 
worthy of the moniker ‘‘the world’s 
greatest deliberative body.’’ 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
could I ask my colleagues to yield mo-
mentarily? 
I would request that Senator INHOFE 
be able to lock in an agreement on the 
NDAA, and then the discussion could 
resume. 
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that Senator INHOFE be recog-
nized.

objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
am reserving the right to object. 
This amendment list does not include 
my amendment No. 1932, a bill that the 
Presiding Officer and I have worked on 
and a bill that the majority leader has 
voted for. 
This amendment is so simple. It pro-
fessionalizes how the military pros-
ecutes serious crimes—serious crimes 
such as sexual assault, rape, and mur-
der. It removes the systemic fear that 
survivors 
have 
in 
reporting 
these 
crimes. 
According to the Pentagon’s most re-
cent survey, almost 21,000 servicemem-
bers were sexually assaulted in 2018. 
This is a 30-percent increase from the 
year before. The current climate is not 
good for survivors. Currently, most 
survivors are retaliated against when 
they come forward and report these 
crimes. In fact, the rate of retaliation 
is two-thirds of all survivors, un-
changed from past years. Worse than 
that, of the cases that the command 
considers for action, of those unique 
few, only 10 percent of those went to 
trial. 
Year after year, we have hearings, 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member. 
We have hearings and the commanders 
and generals come forward and say: 
Ma’am, we have got this. Let us take 
care of this. We have got this. We know 
what we are doing. We understand. We 
are going to take this crime so seri-
ously. We are going to prosecute these 
cases. Leave it to us. We know what we 
are doing. 
It is infuriating. They should not say 
they know what they are doing or they 
are just lying to us—it is one or the 
other—but, either way, they are fail-
ing. The failure rate is so high—20,000 
rapes last year; less than 10 percent 
going to trial of the small number that 
are even considered. The rate of con-
viction is going down. 
There is no measurable in the entire 
system of military justice for these 
survivors that is getting better—not 
one aspect. 
‘‘We have got this, ma’am. Leave it 
to us.’’ It is just not true. They don’t 
have it. They never have. 
If they don’t look themselves in the 
mirror and recognize their failures, 
they never will. Year after year, thou-
sands of servicemembers are raped and 
sexually assaulted and assailants are 
not held accountable. It is not just a 
few bad apples. In many of those cases, 
the assailant is someone in the sur-
vivor’s chain of command—the same 
chain of command that decides the 
case. They pick the judges, the juries, 
the prosecutors, and the defense coun-
sel. That is the system. That system is 
so weighted that if a commander has a 
view before they go in, your chance of 
success is very little. 
There is no other judicial system in 
America that would ever allow this to 
happen. That commander is not even 
trained. He is not a prosecutor. He is 
not a lawyer. This system is not deliv-
ering justice. People in the military do 
not have the benefit of civil liberties 
because of this. They don’t get justice. 
They never had it, and they never will. 
This amendment, this bipartisan and 
commonsense reform, leaves the ma-
jority of uniquely military crimes 
within the chain of command. It would 
only remove the decision making over 
whether to prosecute serious crimes to 
independent, trained, unbiased mili-
tary impartial prosecutors. 
It is the Senate’s job to provide the 
oversight and accountability to the 
U.S. military. We owe our U.S. service-
members everything. For every year 
that we don’t address this fundamental 
scourge, it is another year we are fail-
ing them. I have asked for a vote, Mr. 
Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, 
for 5 years in a row. This is the fifth 
year I am denied a vote. It is the fifth 
year that you are saying to our serv-
icemembers that you don’t care, and 
you don’t want to fix the system. 
We have tried every small-ball re-
form you can imagine—every study, 
every panel, every recommendation. 
We have made sure those recommenda-
tions got in the underlying bill every 
year. They are just not working. So I 
would like for us to look ourselves in 
the mirror and say: Are we doing our 
job? Are we standing by our service-
members when they need us? Sadly, 
the answer is no. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to modify 
your request to include amendment No. 
1932 to just get a vote on it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, let me just 
make a comment first. 
This is a first step. We have a lot of 
things happening after this. We are 
going to be on the Senate floor for 
hours and hours. You will have ample 
time to entertain your amendment, 
and I would be very happy to assist you 
in that. 
For that reason, I would not want to 
jeopardize those 60 names and amend-
ments that I have already offered, to 
jeopardize their efforts by adding your 
language, and so I do object. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. I will withdraw my objec-
tion, and I look forward to working 
with you on the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the original request? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Under 
the 
order 
consented, 
the 
amendments are now pending, and the 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ments, en bloc. 
The amendments were agreed to en 
bloc, as follows:

AMENDMENT NO. 2186 
(Purpose: To require the Comptroller Gen-

gress a report assessing the billing prac-
tices of the Department of Defense for care 
received under the TRICARE program and 
at military medical treatment facilities) 
At the end of subtitle C of title VII, add 
the following: 
SEC. ll. REPORT ON BILLING PRACTICES FOR 
HEALTH CARE FROM DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Through the TRICARE program, the 
Department of Defense provides health care 
benefits 
and 
services 
to 
approximately 
9,500,000 beneficiaries. 
(2) The Department of Defense is not struc-
tured as a typical health care provider, 
which can lead to complicated billing prac-
tices and strict deadlines for members of the 
Armed Forces, former members of the Armed 
Forces, and their dependents, as well as for 
providers. 
(3) Numerous findings issued by the Inspec-
tor General of the Department of Defense be-
tween 2014 and 2019 describe the third-party 
collection program of the Department as in-
adequately managed, resulting in substantial 
uncollected funds that could be used to im-
prove the quality of health care at military 
medical treatment facilities. 
(4) Numerous press reports have found that 
the Federal Government aggressively col-
lects unpaid debts from uninsured or low-in-
come civilian patients who happen to receive 
treatment at a military medical treatment 
facility, even though providing that treat-
ment often benefits military readiness by 
providing experience to military medical 
professionals. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that it is in the national interest of 
the United States to ensure members of the 
Armed Forces, former members of the Armed 
Forces, and their dependents receive high- 
quality health care, and that Federal agen-
cies prioritize fairness and accessibility 
when administering health care. 
(c) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to Congress a report assessing 
the billing practices of the Department of 
Defense 
for 
care 
received 
under 
the 
TRICARE program or at military medical 
treatment facilities. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) A description of the extent to which 
data is being collected and maintained on 
whether beneficiaries under the TRICARE 
program have other forms of health insur-
ance. 
(B) A description of the extent to which 
the Secretary of Defense has implemented 
the recommendations of the Inspector Gen-
eral of the Department of Defense to improve 
collections of third-party payments for care 
at military medical treatment facilities and 
a description of the impact such implemen-
tation has had on such beneficiaries. 
(C) A description of the extent to which 
the process used by managed care support 
contractors under the TRICARE program to 
adjudicate third-party liability claims is ef-
ficient and effective, including with respect 
to communication with such beneficiaries. 
(d) TRICARE PROGRAM DEFINED.—In this

the meaning given that term in section 1072 
of title 10, United States Code.

states: ‘‘[T]he Asia Reassurance Initiative 
Act, a major bipartisan legislation, was 
signed into law by President Trump on De-
cember 31, 2018. This legislation enshrines a 
generational 
whole-of-government 
policy 
framework that demonstrates U.S. commit-
ment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region 
and includes initiatives that promote sov-
ereignty, rule of law, democracy, economic 
engagement, and regional security.’’. 
(2) The Indo-Pacific Strategy Report fur-
ther states: ‘‘The United States has a vital 
interest in upholding the rules-based inter-
national order, which includes a strong, 
prosperous, and democratic Taiwan. . .The 
Department [of Defense] is committed to 
providing Taiwan with defense articles and 
services in such quantity as may be nec-
essary to enable Taiwan to maintain a suffi-
cient self-defense capability.’’.

regular transfers of defense articles to Tai-
wan that are tailored to meet the existing 
and likely future threats from the People’s 
Republic of China, including supporting the 
efforts of Taiwan to develop and integrate 
asymmetric capabilities, as appropriate, in-
cluding mobile, survivable, and cost-effective 
capabilities, into its military forces.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–409; 132 Stat. 5387) has 
recommitted the United States to support 
the close, economic, political, and security 
relationship between the United States and 
Taiwan; and 
(2) the United States should fully imple-
ment the provisions of that Act with regard 
to regular defensive arms sales to Taiwan.

(1) the continued security of the Baltic 
states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is 
critical to achieving United States national 
security interests and defense objectives 
against the acute and formidable threat 
posed by Russia; 
(2) the United States and the Baltic states 
are leaders in the mission of defending inde-
pendence and democracy from aggression 
and in promoting stability and security 
within the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO), with non-NATO partners, and 
with other international organizations such 
as the European Union; 
(3) the Baltic states are model NATO allies 
in terms of burden sharing and capital in-
vestment in materiel critical to United 
States and allied security, investment of 
over 2 percent of their gross domestic prod-
uct on defense expenditure, allocating over 
20 percent of their defense budgets on capital 
modernization, matching security assistance 
from the United States, frequently deploying 
their forces around the world in support of 
allied and United States objectives, and

larly those that possess expertise and dex-
terity but do not enjoy the benefits of na-
tional economies of scale; 
(5) the United States should pursue a dedi-
cated initiative focused on defense and secu-
rity assistance, coordination, and planning 
designed to ensure the continued security of 
the Baltic states and on deterring current 
and future challenges to the national sov-
ereignty of United States allies and partners 
in the Baltic region; and 
(6) such an initiative should include an in-
novative and comprehensive conflict deter-
rence strategy for the Baltic region encom-
passing the unique geography of the Baltic 
states, modern and diffuse threats to their 
land, sea, and air spaces, and necessary im-
provements to their defense posture, includ-
ing command-and-control infrastructure, in-
telligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
capabilities, communications equipment and 
networks, and special forces.

S4193 
July 2, 2020 
(2) PHASE 1.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Under the initial phase of 
the study conducted under paragraph (1), the 
Secretary of Defense shall determine if there 
is a higher incidence of cancers occurring for 
covered individuals as compared to similar 
age groups in the general population through

including frequencies or electromagnetic 
fields, where exposure to ionizing radiation 
(associated with high altitude flight) and 
nonionizing radiation (associated with air-
borne, ground, and shipboard radars) oc-
curred in which covered individuals could 
have received increased radiation amounts. 
(iii) Identify, for each covered individual, 
duty stations, dates of service, aircraft 
flown, and additional duties (including Land-
ing Safety Officer, Catapult and Arresting 
Gear Officer, Air Liaison Officer, Tactical 
Air Control Party, or personnel associated 
with aircraft maintenance, supply, logistics, 
fuels, or transportation) that could have in-
creased the risk of cancer for such covered 
individual. 
(iv) Determine locations where a covered 
individual served or additional duties of a 
covered individual that are associated with 
higher incidences of cancers. 
(v) Identify potential exposures due to 
service in the Armed Forces that are not re-
lated to aviation, such as exposure to burn 
pits or toxins in contaminated water, embed-
ded in the soil, or inside bases or housing.

AMENDMENT NO. 2220 
(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate 
on the extension of limitations on the im-
portation of uranium from the Russian 
Federation) 
At the end of subtitle F of title XXXI, add 
the following: 
SEC. 3168. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXTENSION 
OF LIMITATIONS ON IMPORTATION 
OF URANIUM FROM RUSSIAN FED-
ERATION. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) a secure nuclear fuel supply chain is es-
sential to the economic and national secu-
rity of the United States; 
(2) the United States should— 
(A) expeditiously complete negotiation of 
an extension of the Agreement Suspending 
the Antidumping Investigation on Uranium 
from the Russian Federation (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Russian Suspension Agree-
ment’’); or 
(B) if an agreement to extend the Russian 
Suspension Agreement cannot be reached, 
complete 
the 
antidumping 
investigation 
under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) with respect to imports of 
uranium from the Russian Federation— 
(i) to avoid unfair trade in uranium and 
maintain a nuclear fuel supply chain in the 
United States, consistent with the national 
security and nonproliferation goals of the 
United States; and 
(ii) to protect the United States nuclear 
fuel supply chain from the continued manip-
ulation of the global and United States ura-
nium markets by the Russian Federation 
and Russian-influenced competitors; 
(3) a renegotiated, long-term extension of 
the Russian Suspension Agreement can pre-
vent adversaries of the United States from 
monopolizing the nuclear fuel supply chain; 
(4) as was done in 2008, upon completion of 
a new negotiated long-term extension of the 
Russian Suspension Agreement, Congress 
should enact legislation to codify the terms 
of extension into law to ensure long-term 
stability for the domestic nuclear fuel supply 
chain; and 
(5) if the negotiations to extend the Rus-
sian Suspension Agreement prove unsuccess-
ful, Congress should be prepared to enact leg-
islation to prevent the manipulation by the 
Russian Federation of global uranium mar-
kets and potential domination by the Rus-
sian Federation of the United States ura-
nium market. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2235 
(Purpose: To authorize a pilot program to ex-
plore the use of consumption-based solu-
tions 
to 
address 
software-intensive 
warfighting capability) 
At the end of subtitle F of title VIII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 884. PILOT PROGRAM EXPLORING THE USE 
OF 
CONSUMPTION-BASED 
SOLU-
TIONS TO ADDRESS SOFTWARE-IN-
TENSIVE 
WARFIGHTING 
CAPA-
BILITY. 
(a) FINDING.—In its final report, the Sec-
tion 809 Panel recommended the adoption of 
consumption-based approaches at the De-
partment of Defense, stating, ‘‘More things 
will be sold as a service in the future. XaaS 
could really mean everything in the context 
of the Internet of things (IoT). Consumption- 
based solutions are appearing in many indus-
try sectors, from last mile transportation 
(e.g., bike shares and electric scooters) to ag-
riculture (e.g., tractor-as-a-service for farm-
ers in developing countries). Most smart 
phone users are familiar with software up-
dates that provide bug fixes or new features. 
A more extreme example of technology inno-
vation enabled by the IoT is the ability to 
deliver physical performance improvements 
to vehicles through over-the-air software up-
dates. . . In the not-so-distant future, cloud 
computing and the IoT will enable consump-
tion-based solution offerings and delivery 
models that are hard to imagine today.’’ 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress— 
(1) that the Department of Defense should 
take advantage of ‘‘as-a-service’’ or ‘‘aaS’’ 
approaches in commercial capability devel-
opment, particularly where the capability is 
software-defined, and cloud-enabled; 
(2) to support the Department of Defense’s 
commitment to new approaches to develop-
ment and acquisition of software; 
(3) that the Department should explore a 
variety of approaches, to include the use of 
consumption-based solutions for software-in-
tensive warfighting capability; and 
(4) that, in conducting activities under the 
pilot program established under this pro-
gram, the Department should use the Soft-
ware pathway under the new Adaptive Ac-
quisition Framework. 
(c) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to the avail-
ability of appropriations, the Secretary of 
Defense is authorized to establish a pilot 
program to explore the use of consumption- 
based solutions to address software-intensive 
warfighting capability. 
(d) SELECTION
OF
INITIATIVES.—The Sec-
retary of each military department and the 
commander of each combatant command 
with acquisition authority shall propose for 
selection by the Secretary of Defense for the 
pilot program at least one and not more than 
three initiatives that are well-suited to ex-
plore consumption-based solutions to address 
software-intensive 
warfighting 
capability. 
The initiatives may be new or existing pro-
grams of record and shall focus on software- 
defined or machine-enabled warfighting ap-
plications, and may include applications 
that— 
(1) rapidly analyze sensor data; 
(2) secure warfighter networks, including 
multi-level security; 
(3) swiftly transport information across 
various networks and network modalities; or 
(4) otherwise enable joint all-domain oper-
ational concepts, including in a contested 
environment. 
(e) CONTRACT
REQUIREMENTS.—Contracts 
for consumption-based solutions entered into

(1) the solution to be measurable on a fre-
quent interval customary for the type of so-
lution; 
(2) the contractor to notify the govern-
ment when consumption reaches 75 percent 
and 90 percent of the contract funded 
amount; and 
(3) discretion for the contracting officer to 
add new features or capabilities without ad-
ditional competition for the contract, pro-

tions for statutory or regulatory changes to 
facilitate their use. 
(i) 
CONSUMPTION-BASED
SOLUTION
DE-
FINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘consump-
tion-based solution’’ means any combination 
of software, hardware or equipment, and 
labor or services that provides a seamless ca-
pability that is metered and billed based on 
actual usage and predetermined pricing per 
resource unit, and includes the ability to 
rapidly scale capacity up or down.

CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on Calendar 
No. 483, S. 4049, a bill to authorize appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2021 for military activi-

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the man-
datory quorum calls for the cloture 
motions be waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that notwith-
standing rule XXII, the cloture mo-
tions ripen following the disposition of 
the Tester amendment No. 1972, as 
modified. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 5 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT 
NO. 2352 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to add my amend-
ment No. 2352 to the list of amend-
ments to be voted on under the pre-
vious agreement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, 3 weeks 
ago, my colleagues across the aisle 
tried to pull a fast one on the Amer-
ican people. Behind closed doors, with 
no public hearings and no public de-
bate, they decided that some of the 
names of our Nation’s military bases 
must be removed, stripped, replaced, 
erased, and they decided that war me-
morials of fallen soldiers should come 
down. I objected to that effort then, 
and I object to it now. 
The national defense legislation that 
we are considering, the legislation that 
funds our military and protects our 
citizens, should not be turned into a 
vehicle for the cancel culture. The can-
cel culture that I think you know what 
I mean—the cancel culture that is tear-
ing down statues of George Wash-
ington, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham 
Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt now, 
for heaven’s sake—this cancel move-
ment seeks to divide us, not unite; to 
erase our history, rather than to reck-
on with it; to turn away from our long 
and shared struggle to forge a more 
perfect Union, and, instead, to build an 
entirely different America of a kind of 
woke fundamentalism. 
I am here to advocate for a better 
way. All I ask for is a vote on an 
amendment to have this discussion in

public, to have the discussion about re-
naming our military bases and about 
the future of these war memorials in 
public, to conduct open hearings where 
military families and veterans and the 
local community can be heard and 
where we can seek and find common 
ground together. That is all I am ask-
ing for. And all I am asking for is a 
vote on this. 
Yet, here today, on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate, I have been told that we 
cannot even have a vote. We can’t even 
call the roll on this. No, we just have 
to swallow it and move on as the woke 
cancel culture moves on, steamrolling 
our history and our traditions, and, 
yes, our best traditions as Americans. 
You know, our military bases are 
more than walls and fences. They are 
more than lines on a piece of paper in 
a 1,000-page bill. Our bases are full of 
life and history. They are hallowed 
ground for the soldiers and veterans 
who have trained and served at them. 
They enrich local communities with 
their legacy. They form fond memo-
ries, and they help relationships en-
dure. They have meaning that tran-
scends any one person or even a place, 
and that history belongs to all of us. 
So all of us should debate this together 
and move forward together. I am sorry 
that we have been denied an oppor-
tunity to do so today. 
I yield the floor.

HONG KONG AUTONOMY ACT 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, what is 
happening at this moment in Hong 
Kong is a tragedy, a crime, an affront 
to the civilized world. In a year in 
which so much has happened, we may 
look back in the near future and view 
this moment in Hong Kong as the sin-
gle biggest moment of the year. It is 
not getting enough attention, though, 
because the Communist Party is using 
the pandemic as cover for its crimes 
against Hong Kong. 
Under the cover of night, the Com-
munist Party’s puppets in Hong Kong 
have enacted a security law that 
threatens to sweep aside the traditions 
and freedoms that have made that city 
such a special place. While the Chinese 
Communist Party hasn’t yet rolled in 
tanks, as it did in Tiananmen Square, 
the effects of this law are no less 
chilling to democracy. 
The security law imposes broad pro-
hibitions on what it calls subversive 
activities. What kinds of activities? 
Activities like waving flags or chant-
ing a slogan like ‘‘Hong Kong independ-
ence’’ or ‘‘Hongkongers, build a na-
tion.’’ In other words, the security law 
criminalizes basic elements of peaceful 
protests and democratic change that 
Hongkongers have used for years and 
that set them apart from their fellow 
citizens on the mainland. 
The new law also erodes the rights of 
the accused that are essential to a fair 
legal system. The Chinese Communist 
Party isn’t interested in rights or fair-
ness. It is interested in control—total 
control—and this law exerts total con-
trol over the people of Hong Kong. 
Under the new law, protesters ac-
cused of such vague crimes as sepa-
ratism and collusion can be smuggled 
away to mainland China to be tried in 
Communist 
courts. 
The 
so-called 
crimes don’t even have to be com-
mitted in Hong Kong in order to be 
punished; the new law could encompass 
expatriates with foreign citizenship 
living overseas—even here in America. 
So simply meeting with a U.S. Senator, 
like me or Senator MCCONNELL or Sen-
ator SCHUMER or Senator VAN HOLLEN, 
could land a Hongkonger in prison for 
a 
lifetime. 
The 
China 
Communist 
Party thus is extending its iron rule 
beyond its own shores to our free soil. 
Those convicted under the new law 
could face life imprisonment, alongside 
the many underground church leaders, 
Uighurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong mem-
bers, and other persecuted individuals 
the Chinese Communist Party has al-
ready ‘‘disappeared.’’ 
Indeed, the crackdown is already un-
derway. The Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s agents in Hong Kong rounded up as 
many as 300 protesters this week for 
what it called unlawful assembly. 
Some of the protesters were arrested 
under the supposed authority of the 
new security law. Their fate at this 
moment is unknown. 
The takeover of Hong Kong may 
seem like an event far away, especially 
when we have so many problems at 
home. But the same could have been 
said after the Second World War when 
Stalin and the Soviet secret police 
dropped an Iron Curtain over Eastern 
Europe. Czechoslovakia and Poland 
were far away, too, but the brutal re-
pression of their people showed the 
world what was at stake in the titanic 
struggle between freedom and com-
munism. 
We face the same sort of titanic 
struggle today, and it is not limited to 
Hong Kong. All across the periphery,

July 2, 2020 
the Chinese Communist Party is acting 
aggressively. It has essentially invaded 
India and killed 20 Indian soldiers. In 
the South China Sea, it has attacked 
or otherwise threatened vessels from 
Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines 
and has repeatedly and increasingly en-
croached on Taiwanese and Japanese 
airspace. 
But in Hong Kong, the security law 
proves most clearly that the Chinese 
Communist Party will not abide by its 
commitments, whether to its own peo-
ple or to foreign nations. Through ac-
tions this week, Beijing has effectively 
torn up the joint declaration it made 
with Britain to govern the peaceful 
handover of Hong Kong just as cyni-
cally as China has broken its commit-
ments to the United States, to the 
World 
Trade 
Organization, 
to 
the 
World Health Organization, and others. 
And, of course, this law exposes once 
again the hideous nature of com-
munism, which is so paranoid and inse-
cure it can’t tolerate even a tiny out-
post of freedom within its borders. No 
wonder. Freedom is an attractive, pre-
cious, and contagious thing. The way 
of life enjoyed by the citizens of Hong 
Kong could give the wrong ideas to the 
1 billion Chinese yearning for freedom 
elsewhere in the country. Nothing 
could be more threatening to the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s rule. 
Now the party has begun the take-
over 
that 
Hongkongers 
have 
long 
feared. Those of us with freedom to 
speak and act on their behalf must do 
so now, as one of the great citadels of 
Asia slips into the totalitarian dark-
ness. While dark days may lie ahead for 
Hong Kong, one day the future will re-
turn the sunny highlands of freedom to 
that small citadel. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
F–22 RAPTORS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor to talk about 
one of the favorite things I get to do all 
week, and that is to talk about some 
Alaskans who are making a difference. 
We call this our ‘‘Alaskan of the 
Week.’’ 
It means that I get to speak about 
my State, usually an individual, maybe 
a couple of people, but every now and 
then I like to mix things up and keep 
people on high alert because the people 
I am going to talk about in Alaska are 
the 
ultimate 
people—Americans—on 
high alert. As opposed to recognizing 
one or two, I am going to recognize a 
bunch 
of 
Alaskans, 
an 
impressive 
group, who work day and night, not 
only to keep Alaska safe but to keep 
America safe. They will be doing it this 
weekend, the Fourth of July—24/7, 7 
days a week, 365 days a year, always on 
high alert. 
As we are heading into the Fourth of 
July weekend, Russia is once again in 
the news, and we have been debating 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act on the Senate floor, a very critical 
bill that I am fully supportive of, 
which funds our military and pay 
raises for our troops. I thought it 
would be very appropriate to highlight 
the hundreds of men and women in my 
State who stand watch and patrol the 
northern skies of Alaska and America 
to protect our Nation. They are unsung 
heroes. You don’t hear a lot about 
them in the news, but we certainly ap-
preciate them. I think all Senators and 
all Americans do, which is why I want 
to talk about them today. 
They are our brave servicemembers 
who 
fly 
and 
maintain 
our 
F–22 
Raptors—this amazing stealth fighter; 
our E–3 Sentrys, which are also known 
as AWACS, which are like the quarter-
back in the sky of aircraft; our Alaska 
Guard KC–135 Stratotankers; our brave 
members of the Alaska Rescue Coordi-
nation Center, who operate HH–60 Pave 
Hawk helicopters and H–130 Hercules 
aircraft, should we need a search and 
rescue mission; and our Active-Duty 
members and guardsmen, who main-
tain, monitor, and track threats from 
other countries for our country, par-
ticularly threats coming from Russia. 
These brave men and women—hundreds 
of them—are keeping guard day and 
night over the northern skies of Amer-
ica. 
When the Russians fly their Bear 
bombers and fighter jets into or near 
American air space, these intrepid 
Americans are on duty to ensure that 
our F–22s are there to intercept and 
greet the Russian pilots and aircraft 
who threaten to move into our air de-
fense identification zone, or ADIZ, as 
we call it. They are there waiting and 
intercepting Russian bombers. These 
airmen keep us all safe. As I men-
tioned, they are all worthy of the great 
title Alaskans of the Week. 
Before I get into exactly what these 
men and women do to guard our Na-
tion—and they do it round the clock; 
they are doing it right now, by the 
way, and will be doing it the Fourth of 
July, by the way—I would like to talk 
a little about Russia and Alaska and 
our close geography. I want to give a 
little geography lesson. There are ac-
tual places in Alaska where you really 
can see Russia from your house. 
Russia and Alaska are divided by the 
Bering Strait, which is about 55 miles 
at its narrowest point. In the middle of 
the Bering Strait sit two islands, Big 
Diomede, which is actually Russian 
territory, and Little Diomede, which is 
part of Alaska, part of America. They 
are less than 21⁄2 miles apart from each 
other, nearly touching. In the words of 
a New York Times reporter, it is the 
place where ‘‘the two great continental 
powers reach across the map and all 
but touch, like the outstretched figures 
in Michelangelo’s ‘The Creation of 
Adam.’’’ It is a little dramatic, but you 
get the point—Little Diomede and Big 
Diomede. 
On a clear day, you can see Russia 
from St. Lawrence Island, which is also 
Alaskan, and even from our mainland, 
in Wales, AK. During the Cold War, the 
Alaska-Siberia frontier was called not 
the Iron Curtain but the ‘‘Ice Curtain,’’ 
which we needed to stay closed. 
Much preparation was put into keep-
ing Russia from invading or infil-
trating the United States from its 
northern flank—from the Arctic, from 
Alaska. In the early Cold War years, 
our government recruited and trained 
fishermen, bush pilots, trappers, and 
many, many in our patriotic Native 
Alaskan communities throughout the 
State to stand guard for America dur-
ing the Cold War. And so many Alas-
kans did this for decades. It was their 
patriotic duty guarding the northern 
flank of our great Nation. 
There were the great Eskimo scouts 
of the Alaska National Guard, who 
knew the land better than anyone else 
could. They were so patriotic with 
their love of this Nation. 
It is still unclear how many Russians 
were able to get to our lands, but sto-
ries do abound in Alaska about strang-
ers speaking Russian showing up in 
communities unannounced—five men 
emerging from the water in wet suits 
over olive-drab uniforms, the color of 
the uniform of Soviet Special Forces. 
Go to any one of our Native Alaska 
communities, and today, you will still 
hear such stories. 
Something that is very clear and 
very well known is that between 1961 
and 1991, the U.S. military intercepted 
thousands of long-range Soviet bomb-
ers and reconnaissance aircraft when 
they were moving into American air-
space. We used our aircraft back then, 
the F–102s, F–106s, and later, F–4s, F– 
15s. Then, like now, our aircraft were 
superior to the Russians and that was 
certainly one of the reasons we won the 
Cold War. 
This is still going on today. This is 
still a threat. The Russians continue to 
flex 
their 
military 
muscle, 
from 
Ukraine to Siberia, and they have 
added new Blackjack bombers to the 
mix and their SU–35 fighters. They still 
come close to American airspace via 
flights near Alaska. That is where our 
F–22 pilots and those who support them 
come in. 
Just in the last 6 months, our Alas-
kan F–22s, shown here, have inter-
cepted 10 Russian Bear bombers. We 
are starting to see Cold War levels of 
intrusions into American airspace and, 
of course, our patriotic men and 
women—young men and women, by the 
way—flying these great aircraft, going 
after these big Bear bombers. There 
were 10 missions already, and it is just 
July 2. What are they up to?

Terrence 
O’Shaughnessy, 
who

off Alaska’s coast to the ongoing 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
and 
Russia’s 
testing of our military readiness. They 
are testing us, but we are ready for 
them. 
In essence, that is what we have been 
doing all week—debating and getting 
ready to vote on final passage of the

National Defense Authorization Act, 
which is all about our military’s readi-
ness. Again, in Alaska—24 hours a day, 
7 days a week, 365 days a year—our 
brave men and women are guarding the 
northern flank of America. 
This is how Lt. Col. Dave Deptula, 
commander of the 525th Fighter Squad-
ron—this F–22 squadron, the ‘‘Bull-
dogs’’—described it: 
The Russians will fly their bombers and 
fighters across the Bering Strait and they 
will test our ADIZ [Air Defense Identifica-
tion Zone] airspace—they will try to see if 
they can come into our airspace. And if they 
were going to go into it, we would be there 
every time to say, respectfully, ‘‘Hello. We’re 
here and we’re flying with live munitions.’’ 
He said the goal is to make sure the 
Russians know that they are there to 
protect our Nation and try to deesca-
late. 
By the way, Colonel Deptula is my 
former Air Force fellow and a great Air 
Force leader, just like his dad. 
As an aside, pilots in the military 
have what are called ‘‘call signs,’’ 
which are essentially their pilot nick-
names. As a marine, I know many pi-
lots by their call signs. Lieutenant 
Colonel Deptula’s call sign is ‘‘Ghost.’’ 
Maybe that is because he is an F–22 
stealth fighter pilot, able to sneak up 
on Bear bombers like this without 
being seen and even heard. But I have 
also heard that maybe it is because 
when it is time to pay the tab at a bar, 
he doesn’t seem to be around. Just kid-
ding there, Colonel Deptula, Ghost. I 
can’t think of a better call sign for an 
F–22 stealth fighter pilot in Alaska, 
and we are very, very proud of Ghost in 
the Sullivan Senate office. 
Here is how it works. Here is what 
these brave young men and women in 
the U.S. Air Force do to protect our 
Nation. We have 15 long-range radar 
sites across the great State of Alaska, 
which are constantly feeding informa-
tion to the 176th Air Defense Squadron, 
which analyze that information. 
By the way, I have the honor and 
pleasure next week of hosting the Sec-
retary of the Air Force in Alaska. She 
will be able to see our great military 
members, and we will go out and actu-
ally see some of these radar sites. 
When our military note troublesome 
activity, they send out a bone-rattling 
alarm—what is called the KLAXON—to 
the Combat Alert Cell. This is a group 
of pilots and maintainers who are al-
ways ready. They are like firemen. 
They literally have a pole where they 
scramble down to get to their air-
craft—what they call a ‘‘hot cocked’’ 
and armed F–22 at the ready. 
As these pilots literally race to their 
jets, so, too, does the aircrew of the 
AWACs—the long-range eyes and ears 
for the F–22. They launch very quickly. 
This is taking place at JBER in An-
chorage. Simultaneously, at Eielson 
Air Force Base, about 350 miles north 
of Anchorage, the 168th Air Refueling 
Squadron, a unit of the Alaska Air Na-
tional Guard, launch the KC–135 tank-
ers to meet the F–22s as they are going 
to intercept the Russians and to top off 
the 600-gallon F–22 fuel tanks when 
they are in the air and then refuel 
them on the way back. This is all part 
of one big mission. That is what they 
are doing. 
All told, there are hundreds of Alas-
kans in the air and on the ground in-
volved in operations like this every 
single time it happens. 
As I mentioned, it is happening a 
lot—twice a month in the last half 
year. 
Patriotic young men and women are 
always prepared to defend our country 
in the sky—24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week. 
One thing I want to do for this ‘‘Alas-
kan of the Week’’ is remind Americans 
when they are celebrating the Fourth 
of July—which is a great thing to do— 
to remember that these dedicated war-
riors will be on guard protecting our 
Nation. When everybody is barbecuing, 
celebrating America, think about what 
they are doing. 
If you have seen any video of the F– 
22s flying, it is impressive, but we also 
have to remember there are real pilots 
in those planes. Look how close they 
are in this mission. It can be very dan-
gerous. 
Think of this to get a sense of how 
this all works. It is the middle of the 
night and the klaxon goes off. It is win-
ter in Alaska. It is dark and 20 below 
zero. A pilot hustles to her airplane— 
yes, ‘‘her.’’ We have F–22 female pilots. 
One is call sign Contra. We were dis-
cussing recently in my office about 
what a great job she does. She gets in 
the aircraft and flies nearly 600 miles 
sometimes—certainly, faster than the 
speed of sound—to reach the rough Ber-
ing Sea to intercept a Russian Bear 
bomber like this in the middle of the 
night. She probably had to refuel on 
the way there. 
Sometimes Russian pilots can get ag-
gressive. According to Ghost, we do not 
respond aggressively in turn. We are 
respectful. We are tough. We are pro-
fessional. The Russians know it, and 
the Russians know that they are up 
against the best Air Force in the 
world—armed and ready. So the Rus-
sians usually behave. 
But this can be a stressful mission. 
As I mentioned, it has happened 10 
times already in the last 6 months. It 
is so critical for our Nation. So many 
young Alaskans are involved in this. 
Our men and women in the military 
represent the very best of this coun-
try—brave, strong, committed, devoted 
to our country, devoted to democracy, 
devoted to the Republic. 
That is why we have been working on 
this all week. When we come back from 
our Fourth of July work period, we will 
continue to work on and pass the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
them. 
On this Fourth of July holiday, as I 
mentioned, I hope we can take the time 
to thank them and to remember those 
who have served before. Know that 
when you are spending time with 
friends and family this holiday, dozens 
of airmen in Alaska are on alert and 
ready to go do this mission in a mo-
ment’s notice. 
We have to remember also that the 
freedoms we are celebrating this week-
end have been secured at a price. There 
is no Independence Day without the 
U.S. military and our courageous vet-
erans, past and present. 
Yet it is not just about protecting 
our Nation. Think about this: Amer-
ican servicemembers have done more 
to liberate men and women across the 
globe from tyranny and oppression— 
literally, hundreds of millions of peo-
ple—than probably more than any 
other force in human history. That in-
cludes those who are currently serving. 
Think about that when you are cele-
brating the Fourth of July. Can any 
other country say that? Think about 
the other big countries in the world— 
China, Russia, Germany. Have they 
been forces to have liberated hundreds 
of millions of people? The fact is, they 
are the kinds of countries that have 
tried to dominate hundreds of millions. 
As my friend from Arkansas just men-
tioned, China is doing it again, as we 
speak, in Hong Kong. 
So, yes, our Nation has challenges 
right now—no doubt about it. Yet I 
think the vast majority of us recog-
nizes the obvious fact that we are the 
greatest country in the world and have 
stood for liberating not just Americans 
but hundreds of millions around the 
world. My view is that we are the 
greatest country in the history of the 
world. One reason is due to those who 
stand guard to protect us and our free-
doms and our liberty. 
So a big thank-you to those who fly 
and maintain our F–22 Raptors—our 
AWACS—our Alaska National Guard 
KC–135s; our HH–60s; our HC–130s; and 
all of the Active-Duty members and 
guardsmen who on the Fourth of July, 
which we are going to celebrate in a 
couple of days, will be ready to go do 
this mission at a moment’s notice and 
be ready to protect us. 
I will be up on the Yukon River, in 
Alaska, with my wife and daughters, as 
we always are, to celebrate not only 
America’s birthday but my wife’s, and 
we will be toasting the brave young 
men and women who are doing this for 
our country. I encourage the rest of my 
fellow Americans to do the same. 
To the Raptor pilots and maintainers 
and everybody who supports them, 
thanks for what you are doing. Most 
importantly, congratulations on being 
our Alaskans of the Week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it 
is my honor to be here today to see a 
marine Presiding Officer and a marine 
making a speech. 
We are grateful for Senator SUL-
LIVAN’s service to our country and his 
service in the Senate as a diligent, pa-
triotic, hard-working, good-humored 
Member of the Senate. I am glad I had 
a chance to hear his remarks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4201 
July 2, 2020 
I was trying to think of where in the 
world to go on my 50th birthday, and I 
went to Anchorage, AK, to go fishing 
at Halibut Cove. I had a wonderful time 
and have a great memory. So the Sen-
ator represents a really terrific State. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. I thank my good 
friend from Tennessee for those kind 
comments. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
just 31⁄2 months ago, a sneaky, dan-
gerous virus turned our country and 
the world upside down. It is hard to be-
lieve that it was just 31⁄2 months ago— 
mid-March—that we were headed to-
ward March Madness in basketball; 
that our economy was roaring; that un-
employment rates for about every cat-
egory were as low as they had been in 
a long, long time. America felt really 
good about itself. By the time we 
would have gotten to the Fourth of 
July, it would have been a terrific cele-
bration except that here came this dan-
gerous, sneaky virus that turned our 
lives and those in countries all over the 
world upside down. 
I want to comment this afternoon on 
some aspects of where we are in terms 
of COVID–19 based upon five congres-
sional hearings this month that I have 
either chaired or attended in our HELP 
Committee or the one I participated in 
today in Senator BLUNT’s Appropria-
tions Committee on Health. Of course, 
Senator MURRAY, of Washington State, 
is the ranking Democrat on both of 
those committees. 
Of course, much of the talk is about 
vaccines. Even though we have appro-
priated $3 trillion and another aston-
ishing $3 trillion in credit, that is not 
going to really solve the problem. The 
only cure for this disease, this virus, 
will ultimately be through testing, 
treatments, and vaccines. It is appro-
priate that we talk about vaccines be-
cause our country is moving more rap-
idly than it ever has in producing a 
safe and effective vaccine for a new 
virus. 
As Dr. Francis Collins—the head of 
the National Institutes of Health—told 
our subcommittee this morning, it usu-
ally takes, historically, 5 to 10 years to 
create a vaccine. Here, the goal of the 
administration’s warped speed effort to 
create a vaccine is to have 300 million 
doses ready by the first of this coming 
year—in other words, 6 months from 
now. That is its aspirational goal. The 
administration is not sure it will get 
there, but you don’t get anywhere if 
you don’t set high goals. We know that 
as a country. So it has set an enor-
mously ambitious goal. 
We are taking steps that are like 
none we have ever taken before, such 
as Congress has appropriated money, 
has approved, and is starting to build a 
manufacturing plant for a vaccine be-
fore we know that it works. Now, we 
don’t do that before we know that it is 
safe, but we will do it before we know 
that it works. We can be sure that, in 
some cases, we are going to lose that 
money, but it is better to cut 6 months 
or a year off of the amount of time be-
fore the vaccine comes and take that 
financial risk. I think all of us would 
agree with that. 
Instead of talking about vaccines 
today, which are next year’s solution, 
let me talk about two aspects of 
COVID–19 that are this year’s solu-
tion—in fact, that are this fall’s solu-
tion. One is diagnostic tests to find out 
whether you have the disease or not, 
and one is treatments, which is medi-
cine that can be given to you to reduce 
the chance that you might be seriously 
ill or will even die. 
That is appropriate in the first place 
because, in not very many weeks, 
America will be headed back to school 
and to college. In Metro Nashville, TN, 
public school begins on August 4. All 
across the country, most colleges and 
schools will be back in business by 
Labor Day. There were 75 million stu-
dents who were casualties of COVID–19. 
They were sent home from school or 
college in mid-March—100,000 public 
schools, 35,000 private schools, and 6,000 
colleges. Graduations were canceled. 
Sports championships and once-in-a- 
lifetime events were canceled. 
In our country today, two-thirds of 
married parents with children work 
outside the home, and most single par-
ents work outside the home. Suddenly, 
their children were home. Teachers 
were not really prepared for such 
wholescale remote teaching, and par-
ents 
were 
not 
prepared 
for 
homeschooling. So ever since mid- 
March, students have been in limbo. 
We are looking forward to doing 
whatever we can to help make sure 
that those 75 million students in 
schools and colleges can go back to 
school and college this fall and go back 
safely. That is the importance of tests 
and treatments. That is the first. 
Now, there is another one, and it is 
not trivial. This is a sports-hungry 
country. We love our sports, and every-
body has a different sport one likes. 
The question I asked Dr. Collins this 
morning was: Are we going to have 
enough COVID–19 tests so we might be 
able to watch some football this fall or 
some basketball this winter? I had read 
that the National Hockey League was 
going to test every player every day in 
the National Hockey League. 
It is not recommended by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. It 
is not standard for there to be wide-
spread testing at schools and colleges, 
even though the president of Brown 
University told our committee she 
would like to test all students on their 
way back to Brown. 
The fact is, if we are going to be able 
to go back to school, back to college, 
back to work, out to eat, maybe even 
watch a sports game, maybe even, in 
some cases, attend a sports game, we 
are going to need a lot more quick, re-
liable tests. Let me talk about those, 
just for a moment, in terms of going 
back to school and going out to eat 
and, perhaps, being able to watch a lit-
tle football this fall. 
Admiral Giroir testified this month 
before our committee that our country 
has done 30 million tests—more than 
any other country. We are doing that 
at about the rate of 500,000 tests a day, 
and he says that we will have four to 
five times that many in September. 
Now, I hear about problems in this 
place or in that place about people not 
getting tests or that it takes too long 
for the results to come back from the 
labs. The fact is, that what is going on 
now is every State in the country is de-
veloping a plan for July through De-
cember on how many tests States like 
Indiana, Tennessee, and Alaska might 
need in working with the Federal Gov-
ernment, and the Federal Government 
has been supplying Tennessee with 
what Tennessee needs. 
In our State, for example, which is 1 
of the States that is in the top 10 of 
having frequent testing, the Governor 
has said: If you want a test, you can 
have a test. Go down to your public 
health department, and you will get 
one for free. Now, whether they will be 
able to continue that, we will see, but 
that is what we are doing today. 
Despite that, when 75 million stu-
dents try to go back to school and col-
lege, I imagine principals and adminis-
trators will want to test teachers fre-
quently, older people frequently, and 
everybody in some classes if one stu-
dent gets sick, maybe everybody in an 
elementary school if several students 
get sick, and maybe the parents and 
grandparents of the children if the chil-
dren bring home the disease. So we are 
going to need a lot more tests. 
This is why Senator BLUNT and I and 
others worked together in the last leg-
islation to support what we called the 
shark tank at the National Institutes 
of Health. This was an unprecedented 
effort at the National Institutes of 
Health, led by Dr. Francis Collins, who 
led the Human Genome Project and is 
one of the most distinguished sci-
entists in our country. 
This is a project to see if we can find 
a new way to create tens of millions of 
diagnostic tests that are what they call 
point-of-care tests. That means you 
can take them instantly; that you can 
get a result within an hour or so; and 
that they are inexpensive and reliable. 
You don’t have to ship them off. You 
would probably do this with saliva. So 
you might put a lollypop in your 
mouth and let that saliva on the lol-
lypop indicate, one way or another, 
whether you have a positive or a nega-
tive result. 
Dr. Collins’ goal—and he said this is 
a very aspirational goal—is to be able 
to produce a million of those tests a 
day by Labor Day. This would change 
our lives in many numbers of ways. 
This would mean that Brown’s presi-
dent could surely test all students, not 
just once when they go back but more 
often. It would mean many sports 
teams could test every player every 
day if that is what it required. 
It would mean that we would prob-
ably have more tests than we would 
need.

S4202 
July 2, 2020 
What would that do? 
It would, one, help to contain the dis-
ease so we could identify who has this 
disease so we could quarantine them 
and the people they have exposed in-
stead of quarantining all of us and 
keeping us from going back to school, 
out to eat, and going to work. 
It would contain the disease, and it 
would build confidence. If you are 
working in a plant with 500 people and 
you know that 6 people have had to be 
tested because they had been tested 
and were found to have been positive, 
you are going to worry about that. Yet, 
if you know that you could get a free 
test today and any time you wanted 
and could get the result in an hour, I 
believe you would have more con-
fidence in going to work or in going to 
school or in going out to eat or even in 
playing on a football team whether you 
are in college or in high school. 
So we are pulling for Dr. Collins’ 
shark tank and his effort to produce 
these new ways of testing. They have 
had an unprecedented outpouring of ap-
plications. He said most of them come 
from smaller companies. They are 
down to 26, I believe is the number, and 
they are putting them through this rig-
orous test. His goal is a million new 
tests a day. 
That is important for principals to 
know and teachers to know and those 
who are hoping to play a little football 
and watch a little basketball this fall— 
that there might be plenty of quick, re-
liable tests to help contain the disease 
in your community and to be confident 
that you are in a safe place. 
And then what is the second thing we 
could expect? 
We heard about treatments. As Sen-
ator KENNEDY says in his inimitable 
way, people aren’t scared of the virus 
because they are afraid they might get 
sick; they are afraid they might die. 
And they might, particularly if they 
are in a vulnerable population or older 
age. 
There is no medicine for this virus, 
or at least there wasn’t until recently. 
Now there is one, Remdesivir, which 
the United States has bought a huge 
amount of, which has been shown to re-
duce by 32 percent—according to Dr. 
Fauci, who testified at our hearing yes-
terday—reduce 
by 
32 
percent 
the 
amount of time it takes you to recover 
from COVID–19. According to the ex-
perts who testified, there are other 
plasma medicines and steroids that 
have shown to be helpful. That exists 
today. 
So if you are a parent or a grand-
parent or a teacher or administrator 
worried about children going back to 
school, you are probably not very wor-
ried 
about 
the 
children 
catching 
COVID–19 because, generally speaking, 
they haven’t seemed to get sick from 
COVID–19—all around the world. It has 
been older people who do. But the chil-
dren might come home and bring it to 
the parent or the grandparent. As I 
said, this is a sneaky, dangerous virus. 
You can give it to somebody without 
showing any symptoms of having it. 
But if you get it, there are already two 
or three treatments that your doctors, 
your hospital can prescribe to shorten 
the time that you recover and to re-
duce the chance that you might die. 
Dr. Collins said that by the time we 
get to the fall, he expects there will be 
more of these treatments approved by 
the FDA. There are different kinds of 
treatments, and he didn’t go into all 
the specifics, but one kind he men-
tioned was the so-called antibody cock-
tail. This was developed during the 
time of Ebola, and it was approved by 
the FDA. It helped us get rid of the 
Ebola disease before it came to the 
United States and caused a lot of trou-
ble here. 
This antibody cocktail—‘‘monoclonal 
antibody’’ is the longer name of it—is 
not approved yet. It is not proved to be 
safe or effective yet, but because it was 
once before, there is a cautious opti-
mism that it will be approved for 
COVID–19—a version of it—and that 
those will be ready by the fall. 
If it does work out that this treat-
ment is safe and effective and approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration, 
there are several companies that have 
these antibody cocktails, and they 
should be able to manufacture large 
numbers of them. 
I guess my point is, we talk a lot 
about vaccines. We spend every day 
hearing about the deaths, the hos-
pitalizations, and what is going on, and 
this spike or that spike, but as we 
think about 75 million students going 
back to school and college, going back 
to work, whether we will see some foot-
ball or maybe basketball later, the two 
aspects that are needed to determine 
that are tests and whether the shark 
tank will produce enough of them and 
treatments, and both seem to have a 
good possibility of being there for us in 
the fall. 
We had a hearing last week that fo-
cused on this question: How do we sus-
tain what we have built in this pan-
demic? In fact, one Senator lectured 
me a little bit and said: Why are we 
worrying about the next pandemic? We 
are in the middle of this one. 
And my answer was, because for the 
last 20 years, we forgot about the last 
pandemic as soon as it was over, and 
then we got to the next pandemic, and 
we weren’t as ready as we should be. 
We have had four Presidents and sev-
eral Congresses that passed nine laws 
to try to get us ready, and then here 
comes this sneaky, dangerous virus, 
and we find some gaps in our prepara-
tion. It is not President Trump’s gap. 
It is not President Obama’s gap. It is 
our gap because we didn’t do some of 
the things we should do. 
One of the things I believe each of us 
should do in this Senate is be willing 
this year, this summer, to take the les-
sons we have learned and sustain what 
we built, not just to complete our work 
on this pandemic but to be ready for 
the next one. 
For example, do we have enough 
manufacturing capacity for the vac-
cines in the United States? Well, we 
didn’t. Now we are building it. Are we 
going sustain it? 
No. 2, what about our stockpiles? We 
filled them up, and then they were de-
pleted—the stockpile here, the stock-
pile in the States. Hospitals needed 
money. They sold off their stocks, and 
so they were depleted. We have now 
built them up, but are we going to sus-
tain that for the next pandemic or just 
say: OK, we beat COVID; let’s go and 
worry about something else. 
What about data? We are not getting 
all the data we want in the way we 
should be getting it from the Centers 
for Disease Control. Are we just going 
to forget that, or are we going to do 
something about that now? 
Hospital 
preparedness. 
Hospitals 
weren’t really ready. They did a mag-
nificent job of getting ready, but we 
lagged on hospital preparedness. We 
have built that up again. Are we going 
to sustain it, or are we going to let it 
drop off once more? 
Our State and local public health. Al-
most all of our public health efforts in 
this country are State and local. We 
are not a small European country 
where everything is centralized. We are 
a great big, complicated, diverse coun-
try where parts of Indiana are very dif-
ferent from parts of Tennessee and 
Alaska and New York or wherever we 
are from, and as Governor Leavitt, who 
testified before us, said, for 30 or 40 
years, we have gradually disinvested in 
our public health system. We are not 
building that up, but are we going to 
sustain it? 
So that is my hope, that when it 
comes to building up this manufac-
turing capacity here in the United 
States, increasing our stockpiles to the 
levels they should be, beginning to col-
lect the data in the way it needs to be, 
preparing our hospitals to receive pa-
tients, building up our State and local 
public health—are we going to sustain 
that while we have our eye on the ball, 
or are we going to do what we have 
done for the last 20 years and slide off 
into a short memory? 
Senator Bill Frist, who was majority 
leader of this body, said that he made 
20 speeches in 2005 and 2006 about what 
we needed to do to be prepared for the 
next pandemic, which he said is surely 
coming. They did some things, but 
most of the things that he said needed 
to be done weren’t done. We could do 
them today if we would just have the 
resolve to do them. 
Governor Leavitt said that before a 
pandemic, those who do what he and 
Senator Frist did, which was to say we 
need to do all these things, are called 
alarmists, and then after a pandemic or 
in the middle of it, they are called in-
adequate to the task. 
Then there is the last point I would 
like to make, and it is about politics. 
The COVID–19 virus—this sneaky, dan-
gerous enemy—is a science matter, not 
a political matter, but it has become 
too much of a political matter. 
Take the issue of masks. We have 
gotten into a situation where whether

July 2, 2020 
you wear a mask depends on your atti-
tude toward President Trump. For 
many Americans, it seems that if you 
are pro-Trump, you don’t wear a mask, 
and if you don’t like Trump, you do 
wear a mask. 
I suggested that the President might 
occasionally wear a mask just to signal 
to his followers that it is a good idea; 
recommended by every single health 
expert to wear a mask—certainly for 
the protection of everybody else. 
Another way to say it is that our 
athletic director at the University of 
Tennessee, Phillip Fulmer, said: If you 
really, really want to watch some foot-
ball, wear a mask. What he means by 
that is that it would help contain the 
disease in our area so the football play-
ers can play safely. 
Well, yesterday the President made 
it clear. He said masks are good, and he 
is happy to wear them when he needs 
to. Of course, the fact is, he doesn’t 
need to most of the time. He is tested 
every day. People around him are test-
ed. And—as I am not wearing one right 
now—he is speaking most of the time. 
But there are times when I wear my 
mask. When I leave the floor, I wear 
the mask. When I go back down the 
hall, I wear the mask. When I am in a 
smaller room, less than 6 feet away 
from somebody, I wear a mask, and I 
expect others to do that as well. 
Every expert who testified in the six 
hearings I attended this month said 
there are three things to do: Wear a 
mask, wash your hands, and stay 6 feet 
apart when you can. If all of us do 
those things, we are much more likely 
to be able to go back to school, back to 
college, back to work, out to eat, and 
maybe even watch a little football. 
Vanderbilt University did a survey in 
the middle of May, and what they 
found was surprising. Most of the atti-
tudes of people in Tennessee weren’t 
about male versus female or east 
versus west or any other difference; it 
was about Republican or Democrat. Re-
publicans didn’t want to wear a mask 
very much; the Democrats mostly did. 
Republicans were eager to go out to 
eat; Democrats were a little slower. 
Republicans weren’t as worried about 
catching the disease; Democrats were 
pretty worried. The debate got too po-
liticized. 
I thank President Trump for what he 
said yesterday. He has 70 or 80 million 
people as his social media followers. If 
they get the idea that wearing a ‘‘Make 
America Great Again’’ mask is good for 
the country, I bet millions will wear it. 
If they do, the country will be safer, 
the economy will be better, and we will 
be able to go back to school and do the 
other things we want to do. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD my 
opening statement from our hearing 
yesterday. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OPENING STATEMENT 
COVID–19: UPDATE ON PROGRESS TOWARD SAFE-
LY
GETTING
BACK
TO
WORK
AND
BACK
TO 
SCHOOL—JUNE 30, 2020 
All of our witnesses today are partici-
pating in person, and some senators are par-
ticipating by videoconference. 
I’d like to say something about masks: 
The Office of the Attending Physician has 
advised that senators and witnesses may re-
move their masks to talk into the micro-
phone since our chairs are all six feet apart. 
So that’s why my mask is off—because I’m 
six feet away from everyone else. But like 
many other senators on this committee, 
when I’m walking the hallways or on the 
Senate floor, I’m wearing a mask. 
People wear masks because the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention advises the 
use of ‘‘simple cloth face coverings to slow 
the spread of the virus and help people who 
may have the virus and do not know it from 
transmitting it to others.’’ 
Unfortunately this simple lifesaving prac-
tice has become part of a political debate 
that says: If you’re for Trump, you don’t 
wear a mask. If you’re against Trump, you 
do. That is why I have suggested the presi-
dent should occasionally wear a mask even 
though there are not many occasions when it 
is necessary for him to do so. The president 
has millions of admirers. 
They would follow his lead. It would help 
end this political debate. The stakes are too 
high for it to continue. 
Around here, senators and staff wear 
masks—because we don’t want to make each 
other sick. I was exposed to COVID–19 by a 
pre-symptomatic staff member on my way to 
Dulles Airport and, as a result, self-quar-
antined for two weeks. The senate physician 
told me one reason that I did not become in-
fected was because the staff member was 
wearing a mask and that greatly reduced the 
chances of exposure. 
It’s also a pretty good way to make a 
statement. I like to wear my plaid mask. Dr. 
Fauci uses his mask to demonstrate his loy-
alty to the Washington Nationals. Senator 
Kaine is either a cowboy or a bandit. 
If you want college football to return this 
fall, like I do, listen to the words of Coach 
Fulmer at the University of Tennessee who 
told fans how they can help make that hap-
pen: ‘‘If you really really want sports, foot-
ball, and all those things, then wear a mask 
and keep social distancing,’’ he said last 
week. 
The United States is in the middle of a 
very concerning rise in COVID–19 cases and 
hospitalizations in many states, and the ex-
perts in front of us today have told us that 
washing our hands, staying apart and wear-
ing a mask are three of the most important 
ways to slow the spread of the virus. 
I am grateful to the Rules Committee, Ser-
geant at Arms, the press gallery, the Archi-
tect of the Capitol, the Capitol Police, and 
our committee staff, Chung Shek and Evan 
Griffis, for all of their hard work to help 
keep all of us safe. 
Among the casualties of COVID–19 are the 
75 million students who were sent home from 
schools and colleges in March. 
Add to the casualties the teachers who 
weren’t prepared to teach remotely and the 
working parents who suddenly had school 
children at home and who weren’t prepared 
to home school. Add the lost sports seasons 
and once in a lifetime graduation cere-
monies. Then there were unprecedented di-
lemmas for administrators and inadequate 
school budgets. Being sent home from school 
does not rank with the sickness and death 
the virus has caused. The United States has 
over 2.5 million cases of the virus and over 
126,000 deaths according to Johns Hopkins 
University. 
While states and communities continue to 
take action to help keep people safe, nothing 
was more disruptive to American life—and 
nothing would head it back toward nor-
malcy—than for those 135,000 public and pri-
vate schools and 6,000 colleges to reopen safe-
ly this Fall. 
Earlier this month this committee heard 
from college presidents and school leaders 
about their plans for safely reopening this 
fall. This hearing is an opportunity for an 
update and to hear from the nation’s top 
health experts on how headmasters, prin-
cipals, superintendents, chancellors and col-
lege presidents can open their schools safely 
just a few weeks from now. 
This committee last heard from today’s 
four witnesses on May 12, when three of the 
four were quarantined and most of the sen-
ators participated virtually. That was one of 
the first virtual senate hearings in history 
and surely the best watched virtual hearing. 
Every network carried the two and half 
hours of statements and questions and an-
swers from senators. 
The question before the country today is 
not about whether to go back to school or 
college or child care or work, but how to do 
it safely. Even though COVID–19 has not, in 
general, hurt young children and college-age 
students nearly as much as older or more 
vulnerable Americans, there is some health 
risk. But in my view the greater risk is not 
going back to school. 
Guidance for reopening schools from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics tells school 
administrators: ‘‘the AAP strongly advo-
cates that all policy considerations for the 
coming school year should start with a goal 
of having students physically present in 
school.’’ 
The American Academy of Pediatrics adds: 
‘‘The importance of in-person learning is 
well documented, and there is already evi-
dence of the negative impacts on children be-
cause of school closures in the spring of 2020. 
Lengthy time away from school and associ-
ated interruption of supportive services 
often results in social isolation, making it 
difficult for schools to identify and address 
important learning deficits as well as child 
and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, sub-
stance use, depression, and suicidal ideation. 
This, in turn, places children and adolescents 
at considerable risk of morbidity and, in 
some cases, mortality. Beyond the edu-
cational impact and social impact of school 
closures, there has been substantial impact 
on food security and physical activity for 
children and families.’’ 
Dr. Lloyd Fisher, the incoming president 
of the Massachusetts chapter of the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics told reporters 
last week: ‘‘While for most children COVID– 
19 has not had the devastating and life- 
threatening physical health effects that have 
occurred in adults, the negative impact on 
their education, mental health and social de-
velopment has been substantial,’’ he said. 
‘‘Nothing can take the place of the daily 
face-to-face interaction our children experi-
ence when attending school in person.’’ 
Many American colleges—overall consid-
ered the best in the world—will be perma-
nently damaged or even closed if they re-
main, in Brown University president Chris-
tina Paxsons words, ‘‘ghost towns.’’ 
Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue, 
wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that for 
Purdue, ‘‘failure to take on the job of re-
opening would be not only anti-scientific but 
also an unacceptable breach of duty.’’ 
So today, in addition to hearing more 
about the concerning rise in cases and hos-
pitalizations in some states in the U.S., I 
would like to ask our witnesses in their 
statements and answers to questions to put 
themselves in the place of a superintendent

of one of America’s approximately 14,000 
school districts, or the principal or head-
master of one of the 135,000 schools, or the 
president or chancellor of one of the 6,000 
colleges, and help them answer the question 
of how to reopen schools safely. 
So Dr. Fauci, I hope that in your opening 
statement or in answers to questions you 
will suggest the steps a superintendent 
might take to open school safely, and how 
not only to keep children safe but to keep 
safe the adults—teachers, parents and grand-
parents—with whom they come in contact. 
Dr. Hahn—Will there be treatments or 
medicines this fall that will help speed re-
covery from COVID–19 or reduce the possi-
bility of death? I believe the fear of going 
back to school—or going anywhere these 
days—is in large part because of the fear of 
severe illness. If that risk can be lessened by 
new treatments, it should increase con-
fidence in going back to school. 
I’d also like to commend Dr. Hahn and the 
work FDA did to get tests on the market as 
quickly as possible to help understand the 
spread of the virus. Since then, FDA has 
worked out which tests have not worked as 
well as they should, and taken steps to re-
move them from the market. That’s what is 
supposed to happen during a pandemic. 
Admiral Giroir—at our last hearing you 
said you expected there to be 40–50 million 
diagnostic tests available each month by 
September. Is that still true? And exactly 
how does a school district go about making 
sure it has those tests? And who pays for 
them? What are the prospects from the 
‘‘shark tank’’ at NIH that there will be new 
fast, reliable and inexpensive tests available 
for more widespread testing? 
Dr. Redfield—you are continuing to work 
on additional guidelines about going back to 
school and college safely. Are CDC employ-
ees available to help states work with school 
districts or college administrators to develop 
their plans? And what advice do you have 
about the arrival of the flu season this fall at 
the same time as COVID–19? 
This is a lot to discuss but there will be 
time during the next two and half hours to 
answer most of those questions. 
Let me highlight three areas that have 
come up in our four earlier hearings this 
month that I think need clarification. 
First, contact tracing. There is no doubt 
contact tracing is crucially important to 
identify anyone who might have been ex-
posed so that person doesn’t, in turn, expose 
someone else. According to an NPR report on 
June 18, states already have hired at least 
37,000 contract tracers. State health officials 
and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Secu-
rity issued a report estimating a need for at 
least 100,000 contact tracers. 
Several reports have suggested that the 
federal government should appropriate funds 
to pay for these contact tracers. The reality 
is: Congress already has. 
On April 24, Congress appropriated $11 bil-
lion, which has been sent to states and tribes 
for the expenses of testing. The legislation 
explicitly said that money could be used for 
contact tracing. This is in addition to the 
nearly $755 million from the first emergency 
appropriations legislation signed into law 
March 6 that went out to states for 
coronavirus response and can be used by 
states for contact tracing. 
This is also in addition to the March 27 leg-
islation in which Congress provided at least 
$1.5 billion in the CARES Act for states, ter-
ritories, and tribes to use for COVID pre-
paredness and response, some of which can 
be used for contact tracing. The CARES Act 
also included $150 billion to states, but a sig-
nificant amount of that $150 billion has not 
been spent because it is restricted to ex-
penses related to COVID–19. 
For example, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee 
has told me that he is reserving as much as 
$1 billion of what Tennessee received so he 
can determine what flexibility he has in 
spending the money. Washington state has 
not spent as much as $1.2 billion. According 
the Missouri State Treasurer, Governor Par-
sons has not spent about $1 billion. 
According to the report by state health of-
ficials and Johns Hopkins, an average salary 
for a contact tracer would be a little more 
than $35,000. That adds up to about $3.5 bil-
lion for 100,000 contact tracers. So Congress 
has already sent to states enough money to 
hire all the contact tracers that are needed. 
Second, who pays for testing. In the 
CARES Act, Congress voted to make all 
COVID–19 tests available to patients at no 
cost. That meant insurers would cover diag-
nostic tests, which detect whether a person 
is currently infected with the virus, and also 
antibody tests, which indicate whether a per-
son has had COVID–19 in the past and now 
may have immunity to future infection. 
Guidance from the Labor Department, the 
Treasury Department, and the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services last week 
said insurers are only required to pay for 
tests without patient cost sharing if a doctor 
orders it. I agree with that. 
But given that the CDC specifically rec-
ommends doctors order tests in 2 situa-
tions—when a person has signs or symptoms 
of COVID–19, or recently had contact with 
someone known or suspected to have COVID– 
19—who pays for testing at other times? 
I believe Congress will need to take further 
action. For example, if a school wants to test 
its students randomly, perhaps that school 
should coordinate with their state to become 
a part of the state testing plan, making all 
tests free to students and teachers. Congress 
may need to provide more money to states to 
cover that. 
If an automaker wants to test all its em-
ployees at a plant every two weeks, perhaps 
the automaker should pay for that testing or 
become part of a state testing program using 
funds already provided by the federal govern-
ment. 
Third, flu shots. CDC has said more people 
need to get flu shots this fall so health care 
workers can better distinguish between 
COVID–19 and the flu. CDC says a priority is 
for all children over the age of 6 months be 
vaccinated for the flu so they don’t become 
sick and pass it to more vulnerable popu-
lations who could have more severe con-
sequences. 
On January 24, Sen. Murray and I hosted 
our first bipartisan briefing on coronavirus 
at a time there were only 4 cases in the U.S. 
Since then this committee has held 4 more 
briefings. 
This 
is 
our 
8th 
hearing 
on 
coronavirus and U.S. preparedness. 
Last week’s hearing was about steps to 
take this year, while our eye is on the ball, 
to better prepare for the next pandemic. I 
have issued a white paper outlining five rec-
ommendations for Congress to prepare Amer-
icans for the next pandemic, and that paper 
has received more than 350 substantive com-
ments that are available to every member of 
the committee. 
At the end of this hearing, I’m going to ask 
each witness what are the 2–3 actions that 
Congress could take this year to prepare for 
the next pandemic, some of which undoubt-
edly could help with this pandemic. 
But this hearing is about what happens 
now as administrators prepare to reopen 
schools and colleges. 
Experts underestimated this virus and 
there is still much we don’t know about it. 
But we do know the basic steps to take to re-
open schools and colleges in 2020 before there 
is a vaccine and those are: social distance, 
wear a mask, wash your hands, test, contact 
trace, and isolate those exposed or sick. And 
hopefully by the fall there will be treatments 
to make the consequences of the disease less 
severe. 
I look forward to hearing from our distin-
guished witnesses how school leaders and 
college presidents can safely reopen 135,000 
schools and 6,000 colleges, and also learning 
the latest developments on testing and treat-
ments that we can expect during the year 
2020 before vaccines arrive. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator BLUNT
and Senator 
MURRAY
for their cooperation this 
month in this series of six hearings 
that we have had on COVID–19. 
I think it is very important for the 
American people to know that while 
there is a vaccine down the road, the 
tests are coming, the fast tests, and 
the 
treatments 
are 
coming. 
They 
should be here by the fall. That is what 
the experts say. It is not what I say; 
that is what the experts who testified 
before us say. 
The experts all said the following: If 
you want to contain the disease, if you 
want to go back to school and back to 
college and back to work and out to 
eat and maybe even see a little foot-
ball, stay 6 feet apart, wash your 
hands, and wear a mask. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 4049 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
on the floor today to talk about the an-
nual National Defense Authorization 
Act to support our servicemembers and 
their families. This is one of the few 
things that the Senate actually passes 
and does so on a bipartisan basis, and I 
am hopeful we will do that again. It is 
because Republicans and Democrats 
alike recognize it is imperative to give 
the men and women serving in our 
Armed Forces the resources and sup-
port they need to carry out their crit-
ical missions for all of us. 
This year, I am pleased to recognize 
the importance of ensuring that our 
troops get compensated properly for 
the hard work and sacrifices they 
make. It has an across-the-board 3-per-
cent pay increase in it. They deserve it. 
On July 4, as we celebrate 244 years of 
freedom, I think it is appropriate that 
we demonstrate our support for the 
brave men and women in uniform 
whose sacrifices have ensured the lib-
erty we are celebrating. 
I am also pleased that there is a lot 
in here that is really important to the 
people I represent in Ohio. At Wright- 
Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, 
which is our State’s largest single-site 
employer, the bill authorizes $23.5 mil-
lion for important work on a new hy-
drant fuel system for the Defense Lo-
gistics Agency. It will make a big dif-
ference to our airmen and Air Force ci-
vilians and to the troops around the

world who rely on DLA for their equip-
ment and resources. 
There is also $35 million for enhanced 
energy efficiency at Wright-Patter-
son’s National Air and Space Intel-
ligence Center, NASIC. We are so proud 
to have NASIC in Ohio, and we are 
happy to see this additional invest-
ment in infrastructure for NASIC. 
Hopefully, the Space Command will 
end up in Ohio as well. 
There is also $15 million in the bill 
for construction of a new Guard readi-
ness center in Columbus, OH, which 
will serve as a staging area for the 
Ohio National Guard, which is increas-
ingly being called upon to respond to 
crises. I will have a chance to visit 
with some of our Guard members next 
week in Ohio, and I look forward to it. 
One of the bill’s other important ini-
tiatives that has a big impact on my 
State is authorizing $1.4 billion to up-
grade and modify Abrams tanks. It au-
thorizes about $847 million to build and 
upgrade the Stryker armored fighting 
vehicles. There is also an additional 
$378 million to produce 72 Stryker 
chassis to support the Army’s Maneu-
ver Short Range Air Defense Program. 
This is all really great news for our 
men and women in uniform. Why? Be-
cause they are going to get from Lima, 
OH, the best equipment in the world to 
be able to protect themselves and keep 
the peace. These Abrams and Stryker 
vehicles are the most advanced and le-
thal tanks and armored vehicles on the 
battlefield today. 
Of course, this isn’t just a big win for 
our military; it is also great for the 
Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, 
which I call the tank plant—always 
have. It is in Lima, OH, and it is the 
only facility in the world that can do 
what they do. It is certainly the only 
facility in the United States that has 
the capacity and the highly trained 
personnel capable of producing Abrams 
tanks and Stryker armored vehicles. It 
is a strategic asset for our country and 
a source of employment for some truly 
outstanding engineers, welders, and 
other technicians. I love going to the 
plant and talking to them about what 
they do. A lot of them are veterans, 
and all of them believe that they are 
part of the effort. 
The Obama administration, by the 
way, 9 years ago, wanted to shutter 
this plant. They said that we wouldn’t 
need tanks in the future and we should 
shut down the plant and shut down the 
line, which would have cost billions of 
dollars to mothball and then try to 
start it again. Thank goodness we 
didn’t do that. We fought hard against 
it. I recognized it was the wrong deci-
sion and fought against it every step of 
the way. I remember, at the time, some 
of the taxpayer groups were saying: Oh, 
my gosh, this is somehow inappro-
priate to keep funding going when the 
Obama administration says it is not 
necessary. But it was necessary. It was 
necessary then, and, boy, it is certainly 
necessary now. We saved the taxpayers 
a lot of money by not shutting it down. 
We provided enough funding to keep 
it open partly by bringing in foreign 
sales, and I helped in that, to try to get 
other countries to try to use our tank 
plant, which they have and still do. We 
also 
reversed 
years 
of 
backlogged 
maintenance recently, and we ensured 
our workers have a safe environment in 
which to work. So it is doing well now. 
The lines are humming. Thank good-
ness we kept it open. 
In 2018, I had the opportunity to be 
the first Member of Congress to see the 
latest model of the Stryker Dragoon 
vehicles. They have a 30-millimeter 
turret—a cannon on top of an armored 
vehicle. This is a wheeled armored ve-
hicle with a turret on top of it. That 30- 
millimeter cannon replaced the normal 
50-caliber machine gun. The 50-caliber 
machine gun is effective in certain in-
stances, but the 30-millimeter cannon 
is much more effective in many places 
on the battlefield, particularly in Eu-
rope, given the threat we face there. 
So whether it is in Eastern Europe in 
the 
Baltic 
States 
or 
being 
prepositioned in Germany for the possi-
bility of having to respond, this is what 
our military wants, what our Army 
wants, and we have to continue to pro-
vide our soldiers this Dragoon variant 
of the Stryker so that they can deter 
aggression from Russia and others and 
help keep our allies safe. This includes, 
by the way, Ukraine. 
Talking about Ukraine, it has been in 
the headlines a lot over the last several 
months. I have been to Ukraine several 
times. I had the opportunity to be on 
the frontline in Ukraine at what is 
called the line of contact. Let me tell 
you, it is not a cold war; it is very 
much a hot war. 
I know that here, on this side of the 
Atlantic, what is happening in Ukraine 
can sometimes seem like it is half a 
world away and maybe doesn’t affect 
us, but it is not far away, and it does 
affect us. It is very relevant. In a sense, 
it is where the modern battle is taking 
place 
between 
two 
very 
different 
ideologies, one of freedom and democ-
racy and wanting to connect to the 
West, and that is modern Ukraine. 
That 
is 
exactly 
what 
President 
Zelensky and the Parliament there and 
others want to do. The other would be 
the oligarchy and the corruption of 
Russia, which want to pull Ukraine 
back into their orbit. 
In Ohio we have a large Ukrainian 
community, particularly in Northeast 
Ohio, and they certainly have a vested 
interest in seeing that their ancestral 
homeland can defend itself from Rus-
sian aggression as it works to align 
itself more with NATO and the West 
while promoting the platform of de-
mocracy, freedom, transparency, and 
free markets. 
I have met with President Zelensky 
several times, and I am encouraged by 
his commitment and his passion to 
keeping Ukraine on the right track, in-
cluding fighting corruption. We have to 
continue as a country to ensure that 
elimination of corruption continues in 
Ukraine. I was pleased to see that 
Ukraine was very recently designated 
as a NATO Enhanced Opportunities 
Partner, and one day I hope to welcome 
them as a full member of NATO. We 
are passing, I hope, a unanimous con-
sent resolution in this body with re-
gard to this issue. We need to be sure 
and let Ukraine know we support them. 
For the past 4 years, I have worked 
to include provisions in the NDAA, the 
Defense bill we are working on now, 
that help expand military assistance to 
Ukraine and build on the Ukraine mili-
tary 
security 
assistance 
initiative. 
This year I was pleased that the bill 
again authorizes $250 million in lethal 
and nonlethal aid to Ukraine. That in-
cludes $125 million in lethal assistance 
that they need. That is an increase of 
$75 million from last year’s budget. So 
we are doing even more to help allow 
the Ukrainians to defend themselves. 
New this year, this bill includes my 
proposal to require the Departments of 
State and Defense to develop a new 
multiyear strategy to support the de-
velopment of Ukraine’s military forces, 
increasing its capability and capacity 
and providing a resource plan for U.S. 
security assistance. 
I had the opportunity to speak today 
to General Dayton, who will be nomi-
nated by the President to be the next 
Ambassador to Ukraine. This is a guy 
who has done a terrific job of working 
with the Ukrainian military to mod-
ernize the military, to ensure there is 
more transparency, civilian control, 
and to be sure they are following the 
model that will allow them to be suc-
cessful in recruiting and in fighting 
against the Russian threat. 
There is a lot to like in the NDAA, 
and I have introduced some amend-
ments that I hope will be included as 
well. I will continue to advocate for 
Ohio and for the men and women who 
keep us safe every day. 
I look forward to voting on the bill’s 
passage in the Senate soon so that our 
troops, who give so much of themselves 
just to be able to keep us safe, have the 
resources they need, the best equip-
ment, and the highest level of readi-
ness to be able to fulfill that mission to 
keep the peace and to continue to se-
cure our liberties. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. President, I am here on the floor 
today to talk about some recent trou-
bling statistics that ought to serve as a 
call to action for every single one of us. 
Last Friday, in observance of World 
Drug Day, the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime released its annual 
world report detailing the impact of 
drug use and trafficking across the 
world. Frankly, the report paints a 
grim picture that reminds us that 
America has a unique addiction crisis, 
especially as it relates to opioids. 
The report says that in recent years 
the United States has lost more men, 
women, and children to drug overdose 
deaths—60,000 to 70,000 per year—than 
the next 20 countries combined. 
Let me say that again. The United 
States has lost more people to drug

overdose deaths than the next 20 coun-
tries combined. That is unacceptable. 
This sad comparison of the United 
States to other countries is a reminder 
that we have to do better and we can 
do better. 
Even more concerning to me is the 
recent data we are now receiving about 
what is happening as a result of the 
current coronavirus pandemic. It was 
bad enough, as the world drug report 
shows, but now, during the last few 
months, during this pandemic, things 
have gotten worse. 
The Overdose Detection Mapping Ap-
plication Program is a collaborative 
Federal organization that tracks over-
dose data from more than 3,300 emer-
gency agencies. According to data that 
has been obtained by the Washington 
Post, fatal and nonfatal overdoses were 
18 percent higher in March of this year 
as compared to March of 2019. They are 
29 percent higher this April compared 
to a year ago and 42 percent higher this 
May than they were a year ago, in 2019. 
These are overdoses that are being 
tracked through EMS, ambulance, hos-
pitals, and emergency rooms. This is 
really concerning. 
One of the findings of this U.N. re-
port was that the most dangerous class 
of drugs worldwide were opioids, in-
cluding prescription pain killers, her-
oin, and the synthetic opioids like 
fentanyl. These drugs were the cause of 
about two-thirds of the overdose deaths 
in the world in recent years, according 
to the U.N. 
The recent data shows that fentanyl 
use, in particular, has gone up in the 
United States during this pandemic, es-
pecially when it is laced with other 
drugs, such as heroin, meth, and co-
caine. As many of my colleagues know, 
one of my top priorities in Congress 
over the last several years has been to 
combat this opioid addiction crisis that 
has hit communities in my home State 
of Ohio so hard. This new information 
about the resurgence of addiction is 
particularly discouraging because in 
recent years we have made great 
progress. We had actually, finally, 
after years and years of increased over-
dose deaths every single year—finally, 
in the last few years, we had begun to 
see a reversal of that, and here we 
have, during this pandemic, the oppo-
site happening. 
In 2017, Ohio’s opioid overdose death 
rate was almost three times the na-
tional average. We were one of the top 
three States in the country in terms of 
overdose deaths. Nearly a dozen Ohio-
ans are dying from these drugs every 
day, surpassing car crashes as our 
country’s top killer among young peo-
ple and, for Ohio overall, the State’s 
No. 1 killer. But that next year, in 2018, 
we were one of the leaders in turning 
the tide with a 22-percent reduction in 
1 year in overdose deaths. That was the 
same year, by the way, when national 
overdose deaths also declined for the 
first time since 1990. Think about that. 
From 1990 to 2018, it increased every 
year, and finally we saw a reduction. In 
Ohio it was a significant reduction. 
Over the last couple of years, prior to 
the coronavirus, we continued to make 
steady progress—not 22 percent, but we 
made steady progress in declining. We 
achieved these strides, in part, thanks 
to legislation we passed in this Con-
gress—a significant commitment of 
new resources by the Republicans and 
Democrats on this floor and by the ad-
ministration. 
The 
CARA 
Act 
and 
CARES Act provided local and State 
governments and nonprofit groups with 
additional resources to help use proven 
prevention treatment and recovery 
programs effectively. 
I was the author of the CARA legisla-
tion. We spent 4 years putting it to-
gether, with national folks coming in 
from all over the country helping us, 
and we put together something that 
made sense and that was actually 
working. 
We have also ensured that our first 
responders on the frontlines of this cri-
sis had the resources they need, includ-
ing the miracle drug Naloxone, which 
reverses the effects of an overdose. 
This kind of continued support was 
critical for our communities making 
the progress we have made in com-
bating the disease of addiction, and I 
have been proud to help lead the effort 
at the Federal level, although at the 
State level and local level everybody 
has kicked in, including so many vol-
unteers and so many families, and it 
has made a difference. 
But these new reports show that now 
we are going the other way. We have a 
long way to go in this fight against the 
addiction crisis in America, and I am 
afraid we are in danger now of taking a 
step backward. 
Thanks to the coronavirus, our lives 
have changed in so many ways. Many 
individuals who have lost their jobs 
have had to radically change the way 
they work. Unfortunately, the disrup-
tions have extended to this field of ad-
diction treatment as well. 
As States have begun to order a sus-
pension of elective procedures—this 
happened back in March and April— 
people were not able to get elective 
procedures in hospitals, and there was 
a shift toward more telehealth to help 
preserve the personal protection gear, 
the PPEs, for frontline workers. Many 
patients and caregivers who relied on 
face-to-face interaction and around- 
the-clock care to be able to stay the 
course on recovery from drug addiction 
and from mental health issues have 
lost vital access to care. I think that is 
one of the reasons we see this uptick. 
Some have fallen off their treatment 
plans, and some have relapsed. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
is 
happening 
right now as we talk. If we combine 
that with the feelings of isolation so 
many people feel being quarantined or 
being isolated, the feeling of frustra-
tion, the feeling of despair many Amer-
icans 
have 
felt 
with 
these 
dual 
healthcare and economic crises, you 
have a perfect storm for the resurgence 
in opioid deaths. That is exactly what 
has happened in Ohio and around the 
country. 
Officials in Hamilton County, which 
is Cincinnati, OH, where I am from, 
stated there were 42 overdose deaths in 
May and that at least 23 people died in 
June. In Cuyahoga County, our State’s 
most populous area and the home of 
Cleveland, the medical examiner’s of-
fice 
has 
reported 
235 
fatal 
drug 
overdoses so far in 2020 and at least 66 
fatal heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine 
overdoses in May alone. Those figures, 
by 
the 
way, 
match 
the 
deadliest 
months for overdoses on record in the 
county, and that would be back in 2017. 
Remember, we talked about how the 
deaths are going up year after year, 
and 2017 was the peak, and then they 
went down in 2018. Well, this year al-
ready, in Cleveland, we are back up to 
where we were in 2017. The Columbus 
coroner’s office has had to move to a 
space three times larger than its old of-
fice to accommodate the increases in 
overdoses and overdose deaths. We are 
not alone in this uptick. According to 
the Center for Optimal Living, 30 
States have seen an increase in over-
dose deaths during this pandemic. 
The 
Federal 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic has included cer-
tain measures to ensure those suffering 
from addiction can continue to get the 
care they need, and I am glad we were 
able to provide some provisions both in 
the CARES legislation that was passed 
about a month ago but also the other 
legislation we passed around that time. 
We have done a number of things to 
cut redtape and the regulatory relief to 
expand telehealth and telehealth op-
tions specifically for opioid treatment, 
as well as increasing the number of al-
ternate delivery methods for patients 
quarantined at home so they can main-
tain their access to opioid treatment 
providers. These reforms have been 
helpful in offering a lifeline for those 
working hard to stay sober and clean, 
and, in some instances, according to 
addiction and mental health leaders 
from across the State, these reforms 
have even allowed addiction specialists 
to reach new patients who were hesi-
tant to come into the doctor’s office in 
the first place, sometimes due to the 
stigma that attaches to addiction. 
These aren’t perfect solutions, of 
course, because the numbers show that 
addictions are actually up, but ulti-
mately, they have been helpful. We are 
going to have to find a way to get a 
handle on this coronavirus pandemic in 
a way that we can resume these tradi-
tional in-person addiction treatment 
services that have helped so many re-
cover from this debilitating disease. 
We are going to have to ensure that we 
can get away from some of this isola-
tion and sense of disparity that people 
feel. 
One thing we do know is, the benefits 
of telehealth for treating addiction are 
real, and I think we should act now in 
this next COVID–19 bill that we are 
talking about passing next month or 
maybe even later this month. That leg-
islation, in my view, should include 
provisions that allow providers to have

the flexibility to continue to offer al-
ternative forms of care via telehealth 
to people when this pandemic is over so 
the providers can readily adapt in the 
event that another pandemic or an-
other 
disaster 
forces 
us 
to 
shift 
healthcare services back to virtual 
care. We need to continue telehealth 
now and provide the reimbursement 
but also ensure that it is going to be 
there for the future because it is work-
ing. 
I am committed to working with my 
colleagues on bipartisan solutions to 
the challenges we talked about today. 
Yesterday, 
I 
introduced 
legislation 
called the Telehealth Response for E- 
prescribing Addiction Treatment Serv-
ices Act, or TREATS Act, to make per-
manent a number of temporary waivers 
for telehealth services and bolster tele-
health options for addiction treatment 
services. Specifically, the bill is going 
to do a couple of things. 
First, it will allow for a patient to be 
prescribed lower scheduled drugs like 
Suboxone or buprenorphine through 
telehealth on their first visit. Current 
law requires you go to an in-person 
visit when needing any controlled sub-
stances, but this has been a deterrent 
to patients in crisis and in urgent need 
of treatments from schedule III or IV 
drugs. 
Our bill is important. By the way, it 
also limits abusive practices by lim-
iting telehealth visits to those who 
have both audio and video capabilities 
to be able to interact with the treat-
ment providers to reduce fraud and 
abuse when it is your first visit. It 
would also prohibit prescribing sched-
ule II drugs like opioids that are more 
prone to being abused through these 
telehealth visits. So we have provisions 
in there to avoid abuse, but it is impor-
tant to continue this telehealth when 
the other options aren’t there. 
Second, our bill would allow for 
Medicare to bill for audio-only or tele-
phone telehealth visits if it is not the 
patient’s first visit. In-person visits or 
telehealth visits with video compo-
nents are important, and I think it is 
important to have that on the first 
visit because they can allow for more 
robust checkups and evaluations. 
Due 
to 
distance 
or 
access 
to 
broadband, these types of appoint-
ments aren’t always possible. We still 
need to focus on safety and robust 
treatment options, but in order to bal-
ance the needs of patients, we have 
proposed to allow our Nation’s seniors 
to use phones for subsequent behav-
ioral health visits when they do not 
have access to the internet. 
There is no question that the great-
est priority facing our country at this 
moment 
is 
this 
unprecedented 
coronavirus pandemic, but this new 
U.N. report and the rising number of 
overdoses in Ohio and around the coun-
try show that there is even more at 
stake here than we realize. We know of 
the direct impacts of the coronavirus 
pandemic, but losing ground on addic-
tion and behavioral health is one of the 
indirect casualties. Not only must Con-
gress ensure our addiction health serv-
ices have the resources they need to 
adapt to this new reality, but we also 
have to redouble our efforts to slow the 
spread of the coronavirus so we don’t 
lose ground on this addiction crisis just 
as we were making progress and that 
we don’t keep more Americans from 
achieving their God-given potential. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, I hadn’t planned to 
talk about this, but I was watching the 
floor earlier today when there was a 
heated discussion on the Senate floor 
about the chaos and violence we have 
seen on the streets in many of our 
great cities. 
The peaceful demonstrations, which 
developed really spontaneously after 
the tragic death of George Floyd and 
other injustices, delivered a powerful 
message about the need to address ra-
cial disparities and about the need for 
police reforms. 
The right to demonstrate peacefully 
must be protected, but the looting, the 
desecration of monuments, the arson, 
and the destruction of property, includ-
ing small businesses in some of these 
communities of color—it breaks my 
heart to see some of these small busi-
ness owners talk about what they are 
going through; the injuries to our law 
enforcement officers who are just doing 
their jobs, doing what they are asked 
to do in a professional way; and, of 
course, the self-appointed statue de-
stroyers we have seen. This lawless-
ness, in too many instances, must not 
be tolerated. Those who have exploited 
the situation and the peaceful dem-
onstrations to foment this violence are 
undermining the cause of the peaceful 
marchers and further dividing an al-
ready polarized country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 4049 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss what 
I believe is an important and con-
sequential matter at this moment: the 
way ahead for U.S. relations with our 
friend and partner, Israel. 
The pending legislation before us in-
cludes a plan to codify and extend a 
multiyear commitment of American 
security assistance to Israel. Specifi-
cally, it would codify a memorandum 
of understanding reached during the 
Obama administration to provide $38 
billion over 10 years in security assist-
ance to Israel. That is $3.8 billion a 
year. That is a significant promise. In 
fact, on an annual basis, that $3.8 bil-
lion represents over half of current 
U.S. foreign military funds around the 
world. 
It is a big commitment, especially at 
a time when we are struggling to in-
vest in supporting our workers, our 
businesses, and our economy here at 
home during this global pandemic. 
While it is a sizable commitment, it 
is one I have supported because Israel 
is a close ally and friend that lives in 
a very dangerous and volatile part of 
the world. It is surrounded on many 
fronts with enemies who would like to 
destroy it, including Iran, Hamas, and 
Hezbollah. 
Moreover, Israel and the United 
States have a variety of shared inter-
ests. Most importantly, in my view, 
the United States has an enduring obli-
gation to support a secure homeland 
for the Jewish people after the horrors 
of the Holocaust. 
Under normal circumstances, I would 
not even come to the Senate floor 
today. I have consistently supported 
the security assistance, and I still do. 
So why am I here today? 
I am here because while I remain 
strongly committed to the security of 
Israel and providing security assist-
ance, I am also strongly opposed to 
Prime Minister Netanyahu’s declared 
intention to unilaterally annex parts of 
the West Bank starting this month. 
The unilateral annexation of parts of 
the West Bank would totally under-
mine what has been, at least until the 
Trump 
administration, 
bipartisan 
American policy in support of a two- 
state solution that would ensure the 
security and the rights of both Israelis 
and Palestinians. 
Under the leadership of President 
Harry 
Truman, 
the 
United 
States 
championed the establishment of the 
State of Israel as a homeland for the 
Jewish people, and that remains a 
steadfast American commitment. But 
the right to a secure homeland for the 
Jewish people does not include the 
right to unilaterally annex territories 
on the West Bank and deny the Pales-
tinian people a viable state and home-
land of their own. 
So I will say it again: The United 
States should support and continue to 
support the legitimate security needs 
of Israel, but we also need to stand up 
for a just two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for the 
rule of law and international order 
that the United States has championed 
ever since the end of World War II. 
Now, as I said before, the bill before 
us would codify and extend the memo-
randum of understanding between the 
United States and Israel on security 
assistance signed on September 14, 
2016. You can be sure that that memo-
randum of understanding for security 
assistance never contemplated Israel’s 
annexing parts of the West Bank. 
In fact, the opposite is true. Part of 
the American rationale for providing 
Israel with robust military assistance 
has been to give Israel the confidence 
to seek a secure peace based on a two- 
state solution. 
Here is what National Security Advi-
sor Susan Rice said in the Treaty

Room at the White House at the time 
of signing that MOU. 
She first pointed out that it rep-
resented ‘‘the single largest pledge of 
military assistance to any country in 
U.S. history.’’ She reinforced the mes-
sage that the United States remains 
absolutely committed to Israel’s secu-
rity. 
Then she said this: 
That’s also why we continue to press for a 
resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict—two states for two peoples living side 
by side in peace and security. As the Presi-
dent— 
She 
was 
referring 
to 
President 
Obama— 
has said, the only way for Israel to endure 
and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state 
is through the realization of an independent 
and viable Palestinian state. 
That is what she said at the signing 
of the same MOU that we would be 
codifying in the bill before us. 
Lest anyone think that was simply 
the position of a Democratic President 
and a Democratic administration, it 
was not. 
Susan Rice and Condoleezza Rice 
have more in common than just their 
last 
names. 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Condoleezza Rice attended the signing 
ceremony 
for 
the 
previous 
memo-
randum of understanding that took 
place on January 16, 2009, and, on that 
occasion, she too highlighted the need 
to achieve ‘‘a two-state solution build-
ing upon previous agreements and obli-
gations.’’ She said: ‘‘ . . . two-state so-
lution, which is the only way, ulti-
mately, to secure a future for Israelis 
and Palestinians alike over the . . . 
long term.’’ 
So the Bush administration and the 
Obama administration, at the signings 
of the memorandums of understanding 
for security assistance, both said the 
only way forward was through a viable 
two-state solution that recognized the 
rights, dignity, and aspirations of both 
peoples. 
Now, the unilateral annexation of 
West Bank land that Prime Minister 
Netanyahu has proposed would blow 
away, would destroy, any real pros-
pects for a viable two-state solution. It 
would make a mockery of the state-
ments made by both National Security 
Advisor Susan Rice and Secretary of 
State Condoleezza Rice. It would make 
a mockery of the tenets of a bipartisan 
U.S. foreign policy up until the Trump 
administration. 
Make no mistake, those most in 
favor of unilateral annexation are 
those most opposed to any viable two- 
state solution. 
Now, I am under no illusions that a 
viable two-state solution is a near- 
term prospect. It is not right around 
the corner. The Palestinian Authority 
has been weak, and, until recently, be-
cause of the one-sided actions of the 
Trump administration, has decided not 
to negotiate. But even though the 
near-term chances of a negotiated two- 
state solution remain remote, we must 
preserve—we must preserve—that op-
tion, and preserving that option means 
strongly opposing the unilateral annex-
ation of West Bank territory. 
Now, the unilateral annexation by 
Israel of all or any part of the West 
Bank will unleash a cascade of harmful 
consequences. 
One, if we become complicit in this 
action, it will harm our national secu-
rity interests and credibility by under-
mining the fundamental principles of 
international law that we in the United 
States have championed since the end 
of World War II. 
Two, it will further isolate Israel in 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
many countries—including in Europe— 
are likely to respond with different 
forms of sanctions. Some are already 
moving in that direction. 
Three, it will harm both our position 
and Israel’s interests in the Middle 
East, by weakening allies like Jordan, 
and threaten to unravel the warming 
relationships Israel has built with the 
Sunni Gulf States to counter Iran. 
The bottom line is that unilateral 
annexation will greatly strengthen the 
hand of our common enemies—Iran, 
Hamas, 
and 
Hezbollah—and 
hurt 
friends like Jordan. 
Four, it will harm Israel’s security 
by completely undermining the credi-
bility of the Palestinian Authority and 
its capacity to effectively govern the 
Palestinian areas on the West Bank. 
Five, unilateral annexation will ulti-
mately lead to one of two outcomes. 
Either all the people in the annexed 
areas will be extended equal demo-
cratic rights and Israel will risk losing 
its Jewish identity, or Palestinians on 
the West Bank will be relegated to 
small, disconnected enclaves with no 
viable future—what two former Israeli 
Prime Ministers have warned is ‘‘slip-
ping toward apartheid.’’ 
Six, if the current Netanyahu govern-
ment heads down the road of perma-
nently denying the Palestinian people 
their right to self-determination and 
denies them their basic human rights, 
then Israel will increasingly alienate 
itself from America. That is not in the 
interest of either of our two countries. 
So those are at least six of the harm-
ful results of unilateral annexation. I 
am going to elaborate on each of those 
points. 
No. 1, any American acceptance of 
unilateral annexation will undermine 
the very principle of international law 
that we have fought to uphold in the 
international community since the end 
of World War II. The United States has 
been the architect of the rules-based 
international order, as reflected in the 
U.N. Charter of 1945, as well as in the 
Declaration on Principles of Inter-
national Law, based on the U.N. Char-
ter, that were signed in 1970 and found 
in many other universally agreed-to 
documents and commitments. 
It is well established that one coun-
try cannot take territory gained from 
another in war. Now, I know the Trump 
administration has done all sorts of 
mental and verbal gymnastics to aban-
don this long-held American inter-
national principle to create an excep-
tion for Israel, but they look very fool-
ish. 
We all recognize that some of the ter-
ritory proposed to be annexed by Prime 
Minister Netanyahu’s plan would ulti-
mately be included within Israel’s offi-
cial boundaries through a process of 
negotiations. Land swaps have been a 
regular feature of the talks, but there 
is a world of difference between a nego-
tiated settlement and one imposed by 
illegal, unilateral annexation. 
If we, the United States, aid and abet 
this effort, we will lose all our credi-
bility in condemning other instances of 
unilateral annexation. I have with me 
a wrath of angry statements from Sen-
ators of both parties made here on the 
floor of the Senate—outraged by Rus-
sia’s unilateral annexation of Crimea; 
outraged by Russia’s efforts to extend 
its sovereignty over other parts of 
Ukraine—and Secretary Pompeo stat-
ing that the United States ‘‘does not 
and will not ever recognize Moscow’s 
annexation of Crimea.’’ 
I agree. He was right to say it. We, on 
the Senate floor, were right to say 
those things. Those were violations of 
international law. In fact, not only did 
we condemn those actions; we rallied 
other countries to impose sanctions on 
Russia. 
But what will Secretary Pompeo say 
next time? What is Mr. Pompeo going 
to say if Turkey, which currently occu-
pies northern Cyprus, should decide 
one day that it will unilaterally annex 
that territory? That would give Turkey 
more direct claims to the undersea gas 
fields between Cyprus and Israel. 
What about China’s claims to the is-
lands of the South China Sea, or other 
disputed territories in many parts of 
the world that are claimed by multiple 
parties? 
The whole reason to abide by a rules- 
based system is to say not only no to 
your adversaries; you must also say no 
to your friends. Otherwise, it is not a 
rules-based system at all; it is the glob-
al jungle. 
That is why President Eisenhower 
said no both to our British and Israeli 
friends when they tried to seize the 
Suez Canal in 1956. 
If 
we 
accept 
Prime 
Minister 
Netanyahu’s unilateral annexation, we 
will not have any credibility the next 
time around when an adversary does 
so. 
In fact, here is what President Eisen-
hower had to say at that time: 
There can be no peace without law. And 
there can be no law if we were to invoke one 
code of international conduct for those who 
oppose us and another for our friends. 
That is what President Eisenhower 
said, and, of course, it makes sense. On 
February 20, 1957, President Eisen-
hower broadcast an address to the 
American people about the need for 
Israel to withdraw from territories it 
captured during the 1956 war. In that 
case, he said we would not consider oc-
cupation of another country as a

‘peaceful means’ or proper means to 
achieve justice and conformity with 
international law.’’ 
This is a well-established principle 
that the United States has championed 
in the international arena. 
No. 2, the unilateral annexation of 
parts of the West Bank will further iso-
late Israel in Europe and across the 
world. The EU’s foreign policy chief, 
Josep Borrell, said recently that an-
nexation ‘‘would inevitably have sig-
nificant consequences’’ for the EU’s re-
lationship with Israel, and already an 
array of European parliaments are pre-
paring responses, including sanctions. 
In a joint statement issued on June 
24 by the current and incoming EU 
members on the U.N. Security Coun-
cil—that is Germany, Belgium, France, 
Estonia, and Ireland—together with 
the UK and Norway, they together 
said: ‘‘We also share the Secretary- 
General’s assessment that if any Israeli 
annexation 
of 
the 
Occupied 
West 
Bank—however big or small—is imple-
mented, it would constitute a clear vio-
lation of international law.’’ 
They went on to say ‘‘that following 
our obligations and responsibilities 
under international law, annexation 
would have consequences for our close 
relationship with Israel and would not 
be recognized by us.’’ 
None of this should be surprising. Un-
like the Trump administration, they 
are being consistent in how they react 
to violations of international law, ap-
plying the same standards to adver-
saries and friends alike. 
Israel has often been unfairly singled 
out and unfairly treated and criticized 
at the United Nations, and the United 
States has, on many occasions, prop-
erly exercised its veto to defend Israel 
against unfair treatment. But in this 
case, if Israel moves forward with uni-
lateral annexation, strong opposition 
at the U.N. would not be the result of 
the world treating Israel differently or 
unfairly; it would be a self-inflicted 
wound. Again, the Trump administra-
tion 
may 
shield 
Prime 
Minister 
Netanyahu’s government from U.N. ac-
tion, but don’t count on future admin-
istrations to defend illegitimate ac-
tions. 
Three, unilateral annexation will un-
dermine our security interests in the 
Middle East and those of Israel. It will 
put our friends in the region in great 
jeopardy and weaken our coordination 
with Gulf States against Iran. 
King Abdullah of Jordan very re-
cently emphasized that annexation is 
‘‘unacceptable’’ and recently warned 
the Senate of a ‘‘massive conflict’’ if 
unilateral annexation proceeds. 
Here is what the widely respected re-
tired Israeli Defense Force Major Gen-
eral Amos Gilahd said on June 8 when 
asked about annexation: 
It is a disaster. Why do we need to do it? 
It is unnecessary. It is a threat to Israel. We 
might endanger our security cooperation 
with Jordan that is so valuable that most 
Israelis can’t even imagine. 
Arab leaders from the Gulf States, 
who have been strengthening coopera-
tion with Israel in recent years, issued 
similar warnings. The Ambassador of 
the United Arab Emirates to the 
United States, Ambassador Al-Otaiba, 
headlined a recent article, ‘‘It’s either 
Annexation or Normalization.’’ 
He said: ‘‘Once it is clear that there 
is no longer a realistic chance of a via-
ble, sovereign state of Palestine being 
created, it becomes more difficult for 
Arab leaders to justify publicly their 
plans to further develop strategic co-
operation with Israel.’’ 
I know it is fashionable in some 
places these days to discount these 
warnings from Arab leaders. After all, 
it is true, they have cried wolf before 
when it comes to following through on 
their warnings about certain Israeli ac-
tions. We are told: Don’t worry. Don’t 
worry, they don’t really mean it; they 
are just making these pronouncements 
to placate the Arab street. 
Maybe so, but there is a point where 
the Arab street will rebel, when it will 
explode. And that may be the day when 
Israel signals that it will unilaterally 
annex territory in the West Bank and 
eliminate any prospects for a peaceful 
two-state solution. 
What will be the result? The result 
will be to strengthen Iran, to strength-
en Hamas, to strengthen Hezbollah, 
handing them a very potent weapon 
against Israel and the United States. 
They will say they have been proved 
right, that Israel never intended to ne-
gotiate a just settlement and that the 
United States has been complicit. 
Four, 
unilateral 
annexation 
will 
jeopardize American-Israeli coopera-
tion with the Palestinian Authority to 
provide security and stability in the 
West Bank. Unlike Hamas, the Pales-
tinian Authority long ago recognized 
Israel’s right to exist as part of a dia-
logue for peace and a just settlement. 
As former IDF Major General Gilead 
pointed out, the leader of the Pales-
tinian 
Authority, 
President 
Abbas, 
‘‘believes that terror does not serve the 
best interests of the Palestinians.’’ 
He went on to say: ‘‘We have a very 
satisfactory security cooperation rela-
tionship with the PA.’’ 
He predicts: ‘‘The moment there is 
unilateral annexation, the PA will lose 
its legitimacy. If they do, sooner or 
later they will not be able to show 
their faces in the Palestinian street. 
And who will pay the price? Our sol-
diers.’’ 
A respected group known as the Com-
manders for Israel’s Security—a group 
of over 220 retired Israeli generals and 
equivalent 
ranked 
individuals—ex-
pressed similar fears, saying that the 
prospect of unilateral annexation, like 
the coronavirus, was an ‘‘ominous de-
velopment’’ and spelling out the risk of 
the full collapse of the Palestinian Au-
thority and its security agencies. 
Hamas has always argued that the 
Palestinian Authority had been played 
the fool when it recognized Israel’s 
right to exist. They argued that Israel 
would never agree to a just settlement 
if Palestinians first gave up armed re-
sistance and first recognized Israel. If 
Israel proceeds with unilateral annex-
ation, the legitimacy of the Pales-
tinian Authority will be diminished 
and Hamas will be the beneficiary. 
Five, unilateral annexation and the 
abandonment of any viable two-state 
solution will lead to one of two possible 
outcomes, neither of them meeting the 
goals of the parties. Those two dif-
ferent paths have been described by 
Israeli leaders themselves. 
Here is the way former Israeli Prime 
Minister and Defense Minister Ehud 
Barak explained the situation in a 
Haaretz interview in June 2017. He said: 
‘‘If we keep controlling the whole area 
from the Mediterranean to the river 
Jordan where some 13 million people 
are living—8 million Israelis, 5 million 
Palestinians—if 
only 
one 
entity 
reigned over this whole area, named 
Israel it would become inevitably— 
that’s the key word, inevitably—either 
non-Jewish or non-democratic.’’ That 
is from a former Israeli Prime Min-
ister. 
In the event of a scenario in which 
Palestinians living in an annexed West 
Bank are given full rights and allowed 
to vote, Barak predicted Israel would 
quickly become a ‘‘binational state 
with an Arab majority and civil war.’’ 
The second option, if you abandon a 
two-state solution, according to the 
former Prime Minister, the second op-
tion is the current path, he said, ‘‘a 
slippery slope toward apartheid.’’ 
Because those two outcomes are un-
desirable, he pointed out that Israel 
has a ‘‘compelling imperative’’ to pur-
sue a solution of two states for two 
peoples. 
Another former Israeli Prime Min-
ister, Ehud Olmert, has also repeatedly 
warned that Israel is on a path to 
apartheid if the two-state solution col-
lapses. He said, if that happens, Israel 
will ‘‘face a South African style strug-
gle for equal voting rights, and as soon 
as that happens, the state of Israel is 
finished.’’ 
Just recently in the New York 
Times, former Israeli Ambassador to 
the United States Sallai Meridor said: 
‘‘If we take steps that make separation 
from the Palestinians impossible, we 
may destroy the very root of the entire 
Zionist enterprise.’’ 
Six, I believe unilateral annexation 
will have all the harmful impacts I 
have discussed on the Senate floor 
today and many more that so many 
Israelis have warned about. I hope 
Prime Minister Netanyahu will pull 
back from the brink. But hope and 
prayer are not a policy. In normal 
times, an American President from ei-
ther political party would have made 
clear that such action is unacceptable 
to the United States of America, but 
these are not normal times. We actu-
ally have an American Ambassador to 
Israel now who is promoting this uni-
lateral annexation plan and who op-
poses a two-state solution. Here is 
what now-Ambassador Friedman said 
in November 2016:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4210 
July 2, 2020 
There has never been a ‘‘two state solu-
tion’’ only a ‘‘two state narrative.’’ 
He describes it as: 
an illusion that serves the worst intentions 
of both the United States and the Pales-
tinian Arabs. It has never been a solution, 
only a word narrative. But even the nar-
rative itself now needs to end. 
That is from the current U.S. Ambas-
sador in 2016. 
In 2016, our current ambassador also 
said that he is in favor of extending 
permanent Israeli control and sov-
ereignty over the entire area from the 
Jordan River to the Mediterranean 
Sea, clearly snuffing out any prospects 
for a two-state solution and the viable 
way forward. 
Ultimately, of course, the govern-
ment of Israel will make its own deci-
sions, and then, we here in the United 
States will have to make ours. The 
United States must have a position 
that 
reflects 
our 
values 
and 
our 
ideals—our ideals of democracy, of 
human rights, of equal justice and rule 
of law and self-determination. 
God knows we are far from perfect 
here, and we can see that clearly dur-
ing this moment of national reckoning 
around racial justice and equity. But 
we have set those principles as our 
goals, as our North Star, and until this 
Trump administration came along, we 
have also made human rights and the 
right of self-determination a key pillar 
of our bipartisan American foreign pol-
icy. 
It is those principles that have led us 
to support a secure and democratic 
Israel as the home for the Jewish peo-
ple and the establishment of a separate 
viable state as the homeland for the 
Palestinian people. 
The American people support a two- 
state solution and significantly the 
American Jewish committee in the 2019 
survey of American Jewish opinion 
shows overwhelming support for a two- 
state solution among the American 
Jewish community and a large major-
ity who say Israel should be willing to 
dismantle all or some of the settle-
ments as part of a peace agreement. 
The next generation—this younger gen-
eration—of Americans and of American 
Jews is even more focused on issues of 
human and political rights for all peo-
ples, Israelis and Palestinians. 
There are many who have said that 
the possibility of a two-state solution 
disappeared long ago, with the expan-
sion of settlements and outposts and 
the network of roads and checkpoints. 
They have called the prospects for a 
two-state solution a delusion, a mi-
rage; yet, even as the facts on the 
ground have made a two-state solution 
harder to realize, many of us continue 
to see that as the vision for the future, 
one that brings hope to both peoples. 
Make no mistake the unilateral an-
nexation of parts of the West Bank 
would be the final nail in the coffin of 
that idea. So what happens then? What 
do we do? Once any remaining hope for 
that vision is extinguished, I think we 
are in unchartered territory. As Presi-
dent Obama noted in one of his speech-
es, ‘‘The situation for the Palestinian 
people is intolerable.’’ And he drew 
parallels to the struggle of African 
Americans for full and equal rights. 
Secretary of State John Kerry has 
said that if the choice is one state, 
Israel can either be Jewish or demo-
cratic; it cannot be both. ‘‘You would 
have millions of Palestinians perma-
nently living in segregated enclaves in 
the middle of the West Bank, with no 
real political rights, separate legal, 
education and transportation systems, 
vast income disparities, under a perma-
nent military occupation that deprives 
them of the most basic freedoms. Sepa-
rate and unequal is what you would 
have.’’ 
Nelson Mandela often talked about 
the need to ensure a secure State of 
Israel as a homeland for the Jewish 
people and the rights of the Palestinian 
people. He said: ‘‘We know too well 
that our freedom is incomplete without 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
Palestinians.’’ 
There is a memorial statue to Nelson 
Mandela in Ramallah. 
What do we do? What do we do—those 
of us who are committed to a vibrant, 
secure, and democratic Israel that is a 
home for the Jews but are also con-
cerned about the abandonment of the 
vision of a two-state solution that also 
respects the aspirations and rights of 
the Palestinians? 
As I said at the beginning of these re-
marks, I have strongly supported secu-
rity assistance for Israel, and I con-
tinue to do so. I also pointed out that 
National Security Advisor Susan Rice 
and Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice both indicated in their comments 
at the signing ceremony of the MOUs 
for security assistance that a viable 
two-state solution was the only—their 
words—only way to permanent peace. 
For all the reasons I have stated 
today, I do not believe that the U.S. 
Government, the U.S. taxpayer should 
be aiding and abetting Prime Minister 
Netanyahu’s plan to unilaterally annex 
the West Bank. The American Govern-
ment and the American taxpayer must 
not facilitate or finance such a process. 
That is why today a group of 12 Sen-
ators has filed an amendment to the 
bill to make that position clear—the 
position that we fully support the ro-
bust $38 billion security assistance to 
Israel but also make it clear that those 
funds should not be used to facilitate 
and promote unilateral annexation. 
There are many who say that this 
does not go far enough, and there are 
others who oppose annexation but say: 
Pass the security assistance without 
making any statement about annex-
ation or without taking any action. To 
them, I am reminded of former Israeli 
Defense 
Minister 
and 
Commander 
Moshe Dayan’s statement saying: ‘‘Our 
American friends offer us money, arms, 
and advice. We take the money, we 
take the arms, and we decline the ad-
vice.’’ 
We are friends, the United States and 
Israel. We have many common inter-
ests, but we will also have our dif-
ferences. This is a moment when, yes, 
we should provide the security assist-
ance, the military assistance. Yet, in 
doing so, we should also make clear 
that it should not be used in any way 
to promote unilateral annexation. 
Our view in filing this amendment is 
that the only way to reconcile our 
strong support for a safe and secure 
Israel and our commitment to estab-
lishment of two states for two peoples 
living side by side is what we proposed. 
I hope and pray that Prime Minister 
Netanyahu will not move forward with 
his unilateral annexation plan. I hope 
we can continue to say that the U.S.- 
Israel relationship is built not only on 
shared interests but also on shared val-
ues.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
grateful to Chairman INHOFE and Rank-
ing Member REED and their staffs for 
their work to produce the fiscal year 
2021 defense authorization bill. 
The FY21 NDAA authorizes $740.5 bil-
lion in defense spending, up $2 billion 
from last year. The bill provides a 3- 
percent pay raise for our troops and in-
cludes provisions that support spouse 
employment, childcare, and improved 
military housing. It ensures that the 
United States can defend effectively 
against threats from Russia, China, 
and North Korea and invests in key and 
innovative 
capabilities 
and 
tech-
nologies. It includes key provisions I 
requested to boost efforts at Rock Is-
land Arsenal, address military sexual 
trauma, and protect the health of our 
military communities from dangerous 
chemicals. 
But this year, we take up the NDAA 
during a global pandemic, record un-
employment, and calls to address ra-
cial injustice. The bill touches on some 
of these issues. It authorizes $44 mil-
lion for vaccine and medical research 
related to COVID–19 and expands bene-
fits for Active Duty and National 
Guard personnel involved in COVID re-
sponse. 
I am pleased that it includes a provi-
sion authored by Senator WARREN to 
require DOD to remove names, sym-
bols, and other displays honoring the 
Confederacy. If we want to move to-
ward a more just society, we cannot 
continue to honor Confederate leaders 
who committed treasonous atrocities 
in order to preserve slavery. 
I also authored two amendments that 
were included by consent, the first an 
amendment supporting strong security 
assistance for the Baltics that I filed 
with Senator GRASSLEY. The Baltic 
States remain key allies and among 
the few NATO countries that fulfill the 
target spending of 2 percent of GDP on 
defense, and this provision encourages 
support for more robust and enduring 
security assistance. My other amend-
ment is one I sponsored with Senator 
PORTMAN, welcoming NATO recogni-
tion of Ukraine as an Enhanced Oppor-
tunities Partner. EOP status will help 
only further deepen cooperation with 
NATO, which is especially critical as 
2020 marks the 6th year of ongoing Rus-
sian occupation of eastern Ukraine. 
But the FY21 NDAA still does not go 
far enough. 
I field two amendments that go to 
the heart of our duties as Senators, the 
power to declare war and the power of 
the purse. Congress must stop abdi-
cating its constitutional responsibil-
ities. 
Article I of the Constitution gives 
Congress the sole authority to declare 
war. I voted for the war in Afghanistan, 
but I never imagined that we would 
still be there nearly two decades later 
or that the same authorization would 
be used to justify actions around the 
world that this body had not con-
templated at the time. My amendment 
would sunset all authorizations for the 
use of force after 10 years so that Con-
gress can take up the issue and engage 
in its constitutional duties.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4212 
July 2, 2020 
I also cosponsored an amendment led 
by Senator UDALL making clear that 
Congress has not given the executive 
branch any authority to go to war 
against Iran. 
We also cannot continue to let this 
President raid national defense funds 
for his ridiculous and racist border wall 
effort—remember, the one that the 
President promised Mexico would pay 
for. Every dollar diverted has been at 
the expense of our men and women in 
uniform, especially hurting our Na-
tional Guard. This bill does nothing to 
address that. Even when the Ninth Cir-
cuit court ruled last Friday that the 
money grab was illegal, the Depart-
ment of Defense informed us on Mon-
day that it would not stop construction 
of the President’s campaign promise. 
That is why I filed an amendment that 
would keep the President from trans-
ferring defense funds outside of DOD 
for the wall. We need a robust debate 
on the proper, effective way to respond 
to the humanitarian crisis at our bor-
der, one approved by Congress. 
In addition, I filed an amendment 
that would disapprove of Russia par-
ticipating in the G7 or being re-
admitted into a reconstituted G8. Not 
only does Russia maintain its occupa-
tion of Ukraine, but it has continued 
its interference in the U.S. and other 
democratic 
nations. 
And 
just 
last 
week, The New York Times reported 
that Russian intelligence secretly of-
fered bounties to Taliban-linked mili-
tants to kill American troops in Af-
ghanistan. 
Apparently, 
the 
White 
House has known about this for months 
and did nothing. It is unacceptable. My 
amendment makes it clear that the 
U.S. should not support Russia’s par-
ticipation in this international sum-
mit. 
The FY21 NDAA also doesn’t go far 
enough to address the toxic class of 
chemicals known as PFAS, which have 
been linked to serious and devastating 
illness. 
That is why I am pleased to cospon-
sor Senator SHAHEEN’s amendments to 
designate PFAS as hazardous sub-
stances and boost DOD cleanup efforts, 
provide 
blood 
testing 
for 
servicemembers and their families, and 
increase funds to study the impact of 
PFAS on health. In addition, I support 
Senator GILLIBRAND’s amendment that 
would extend antidiscrimination pro-
tections 
to 
our 
transgender 
servicemembers who bravely make sac-
rifices for our country. I also am a co-
sponsor of Senator SCHATZ amendment 
to limit the transfer of equipment 
under to the DOD 1033 program to mili-
tarize police forces across the country 
and provide transparency to the pro-
gram. 
I hope that we may be able to debate 
all of these important issues during 
consideration of this bill, all of which 
will only help improve this legislation 
and provide for our national defense. In 
the meantime, I reiterate my thanks to 
Chairman INHOFE and Ranking Member 
REED for their work on this bill. 
FOURTH OF JULY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, July 4 is 
a day to recognize our Nation’s Dec-
laration of Independence 244 years ago. 
On this day, we collectively pause to 
honor the values that make this Na-
tion great. 
July 4 is also a day of shared reflec-
tion to see how well we have made 
more tangible the ideals of our found-
ers ‘‘to create a more perfect union.’’ 
As we look across the landscape of our 
country today, these words ring with 
even greater resonance. Our Nation and 
our people face a call to action to con-
tinue the fight against racial injustice, 
an injustice that has limited the free-
dom of too many for too long. 
The collective ideals to which Thom-
as Jefferson gave voice in the Declara-
tion’s promise of ‘‘Life, Liberty, and 
the Pursuit of Happiness’’ still echo 
through the American experience— 
from Alexander Hamilton’s immigrant 
dream, birthed before our Nation, to 
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s 
July 4, 1965, sermon at Atlanta’s Ebe-
nezer Baptist Church. As Dr. King said, 
‘‘If we are going to make the America 
Dream a reality, we are challenged to 
work in an action program to get rid of 
the last vestiges of segregation and dis-
crimination.’’ 
America has been and will be a leader 
in the world. The American people his-
torically have cherished and spear-
headed this role. Leadership at any 
level comes with responsibility, and, in 
this case, it means we must look to put 
our own house in order, where we must 
address domestic injustices. 
We must continue our tireless work 
to create a more perfect union. The 
struggle will not stop until all men, 
women, and children can live the 
American Dream as Dr. King envi-
sioned. To do this, we must continue to 
assess the true meaning of liberty and 
freedom. As we begin to acknowledge 
fundamental elements of our Nation’s 
history, we must recommit to ensuring 
freedom for all. 
Our country’s strength lies in the di-
versity and equality of our people. 
Through this diversity and through 
this equality, today we may celebrate 
the unity described in the very declara-
tion of our Nation’s freedom and inde-
pendence. 
On this historic day, we must also 
celebrate our country’s capacity to 
change. 
We 
have 
overcome 
monu-
mental challenges before. The majority 
of our Founders did not comprehend 
that Black Lives Matter. Today, we 
work to ensure actions that back up 
those important words. 
Still, as we reflect on the Nation’s 
founding, we recall our past, honor 
that which is great, and effect the call 
we perpetually hear to make our Na-
tion a more perfect union.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
voted against the motion to table Sen-
ator PAUL’s amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act not 
because I support his amendment as 
written, but because I believe this Sen-
ate has a responsibility to fully debate 
the question of our policy, strategy and 
plans for Afghanistan. 
Tabling 
an 
amendment cuts off all debate on this 
important matter. We should not be 
ducking these decisions. We should 
confront our policy directly, take 
stock of where we are, and set a re-
sponsible course for the future. 
I strongly support ending the war in 
Afghanistan and the responsible with-
drawal of our men and women in uni-
form. However, I believe that man-
dating the total unconditional with-
drawal on a 1-year timeline will result 
in the further destabilization of an al-
ready volatile region. Unconditional 
withdrawal divorced from a diplomatic 
process to achieve political reconcili-
ation between the warring parties will 
make it harder to achieve a peaceful 
outcome that serves our national secu-
rity interests. 
Despite my disagreement with much 
of the substance of the Paul amend-
ment, the Senate should deliberate on 
these matters, not run away from the 
discussion. The decision to table the 
Paul amendment prevented the Senate 
from performing this essential func-
tion.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as a 
member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee and as the Senator from 
the great State of New Mexico, it is my 
honor to recognize all of the patriotic 
Americans who have contributed to 75 
years of accomplishments and history 
at White Sands Missile Range, WSMR. 
In the final months of America’s en-
gagement in World War II and as the 
Manhattan 
Project’s 
unprecedented 
scientific mission achieved its secret 
goal of harnessing nuclear power, the 
U.S. Army established the White Sands 
Proving Ground on July 9, 1945, in New 
Mexico’s Tularosa Basin. Seven days 
later, the detonation of the first atom-
ic bomb at the Trinity Site ushered in 
the nuclear era and began what would 
become three-quarters of a century of 
major scientific breakthroughs, crit-
ical weapons testing and evaluation, 
and military technology advances. 
We must acknowledge the sacrifices 
New Mexicans have made over the 
years that contributed to both the es-
tablishment and the enduring missions 
at WSMR. That includes the families 
whose historic homes and ranches were 
taken to create WSMR’s land base. It 
includes local residents in the Tularosa 
Basin who were downwind from the 
Trinity test and whose lives continue 
to be impacted. It includes the local 
communities in southern New Mexico 
who play a vital role in supporting 
WSMR’s success today. 
WSMR is a landmark of techno-
logical advances for all branches of the

military. Following World War II, 
White Sands was where German sci-
entist Werner Von Braun conceived, de-
veloped, and tested the long-range V–2 
rockets, initiating America’s space 
program. Since then, White Sands has 
continued to support essential defense 
and space exploration programs for the 
Department of Defense and the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration, alongside other important sci-
entific research. 
Today’s WSMR, which spans 3,200 
square miles of the Tularosa Basin, is 
the Department of Defense’s largest, 
fully-instrumented test range. It pro-
vides our Armed Forces, our allies, and 
defense 
technology 
partners 
with 
unrivaled terrain for research, testing, 
evaluation, 
experimentation, 
and 
training that ensures our defense readi-
ness. WSMR executes an average of 
5,000 tests each year. These tests, in 
emerging technologies such as swarm-
ing autonomous and unmanned sys-
tems, joint integrated air and missile 
defense, nuclear weapons effects, and 
space based capabilities, will keep 
WSMR at the forefront of our national 
defense for years to come. 
As part of the Army Test and Evalua-
tion Command, WSMR is the Army 
Center of Excellence for Air and Mis-
sile Defense Test Bed and Precision 
Fires Rockets and Missiles. White 
Sands supports key capabilities in the 
National Defense Strategy and mod-
ernization 
priorities, 
including 
di-
rected energy systems such as laser 
and high-powered microwave systems, 
kinetics, 
electromagnetic 
pulse, 
hypersonic and long-range precision 
fires, U.S. Space Program test support, 
nuclear weapons effects, and autono-
mous systems. 
While it is a U.S. Army installation 
stewarded by the Army, WSMR is char-
tered as a tri-service installation, 
home to elements of the U.S. Army, 
U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. Other 
organizations conducting operations at 
WSMR include NASA, National Recon-
naissance Office, Defense Threat Re-
duction Agency, the Research and 
Analysis Center, Center for Counter-
measures, and Combat Capabilities De-
velopment Command (Data and Anal-
ysis Center and Army Research Lab-
oratory). 
WSMR also hosts the Bataan Memo-
rial Death March each year, a large 
and growing event that recognizes the 
heroism and sacrifice of the New Mexi-
cans and others who endured and in 
many cases lost their lives to the hor-
rors of World War II’s Bataan Death 
March. I have had the distinct honor of 
joining this incredible event on a few 
occasions and treasure the valuable 
lessons it imparts on everyone who 
participates. 
I want to extend my sincere apprecia-
tion and congratulations to everyone 
who works hard every single day at 
WSMR to keep all of us safe. President 
John F. Kennedy stated it best, when 
he stood before your predecessors at 
WSMR during a visit on June 5, 1963. 
President Kennedy said: ‘‘What you do 
here far and away from Washington, 
far away from our great capitals, far 
away from so many countries which de-
pend upon us, what you do here, what 
progress you make, what dedication 
you demonstrate makes a significant 
difference to the security of our coun-
try and those who depend upon us.’’ 
I could not agree more. I wish every-
one at WSMR a happy 75th anniversary 
and will continue to support WSMR’s 
critical work in defense of our great 
Nation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. HALSTEAD 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today to recognize the career of 
Robert J. Halstead, or as most of us 
know him, Bob. To some, this name 
might sound familiar. He has appeared 
before Congress on a number of occa-
sions on behalf of the State of Nevada 
to provide expert witness testimony on 
nuclear waste storage and transpor-
tation. His name graces the archives at 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
and the Department of Energy, and he 
has been a fierce and dedicated partner 
in the fight against the Yucca Moun-
tain project. 
In 1988, the year after the ‘‘screw Ne-
vada bill’’ recklessly designated Yucca 
Mountain as the Nation’s sole high- 
level nuclear waste repository site, Bob 
brought his knowledge of Federal ra-
dioactive waste programs and activi-
ties to help arm Nevada in its fight 
against the broken and misguided proc-
esses that led to the Yucca Mountain 
designation. At the time, he may not 
have known how long of a fight he was 
signing up for, but Bob never looked 
back. 
He threw himself into helping Ne-
vada, learning every aspect of the com-
plicated and far-fetched license appli-
cation, analyzing the geography of the 
site, and leaving no stone unturned 
when 
reviewing 
proposed 
transpor-
tation routes that would ship one of 
the most dangerous materials known 
to man across the country to Nevada. 
For more than 30 years, he helped 
guide the State on nuclear transpor-
tation matters, poured over environ-
mental impact statements, submitted 
contentions to the Yucca Mountain ap-
plication, and represented the State in 
technical proceedings that involved the 
proposed repository. These are just a 
few of the things we have to thank him 
for. 
Since 2011, Bob served as the execu-
tive director of the Nevada Agency for 
Nuclear Projects, always making him-
self available to assist the Governor. 
Before coming to the Senate, I had the 
pleasure of working alongside Bob dur-
ing my time as the Nevada Attorney 
General. No matter the day or hour, 
Bob always made time to review mate-
rials and provide well-informed, robust 
responses not just to me, but to my 
staff. 
It was comforting knowing someone 
with his exceptional experience was at 
the helm, guiding the State on an issue 
that is so important to Nevadans and 
trying to right the wrongs of the Fed-
eral 
Government’s 
reckless 
mis-
management of nuclear waste. 
Just last year, when the State 
learned of secret weapons-grade pluto-
nium and mischaracterized waste ship-
ments having been received at the Ne-
vada National Security Site, Bob once 
again proved how instrumental he is to 
the State of Nevada. His institutional 
knowledge of Nevada’s nuclear history 
and depth of experience provided the 
State with an unmatched resource as it 
rose to challenge the shipments. 
Bob has been a vital contributor and 
colleague; and as he embarks on his 
well-deserved retirement, I want to 
share my deepest appreciation and 
gratitude for his decades-long commit-
ment to helping Nevadans as they have 
worked to bring fairness, reason, and 
science back to the repository site des-
ignation process. 
It is my understanding that Bob will 
be returning to his home in Wisconsin, 
where he will live with his wife, Mar-
garet. Bob is looking forward to having 
more time with his two grown children 
and finally having time for one of his 
favorite past times: fishing. 
As he casts a line in one of the many 
beautiful lakes Wisconsin has to offer, 
I hope he knows how much the State of 
Nevada and I appreciate the sacrifices 
he has made to protect the safety of 
Nevadans and the time he has dedi-
cated to one of our State’s greatest 
fights.∑

TRIBUTE TO JESSICA COCHRAN 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Jessica Cochran of Blaine County for 
her entrepreneurship and creativity 
during these challenging times. 
The COVID–19 outbreak has impacted 
so many Montana small business own-
ers and local communities. During 
these challenging times, it is tougher 
than ever for new entrepreneurs to 
open up shop. 
Jessica, a sixth grade teacher at Har-
lem Elementary School, however took 
the initiative to start up her own ice 
cream truck business this summer to 
spread some cheer to her community 
during these hard times. 
Jessica started Bliss Ice Cream, after 
acquiring and renovating a 1985 Chevy 
Astro van. Jessica also secured all the 
necessary permits and licenses as an 
independent contractor and food ven-
dor for the summer. Owning an ice 
cream truck has been a dream of hers 
since a child. She has taken the initia-
tive to purchase all the necessary sup-
plies and decorations for the children 
of Harlem and the Fort Belknap area. 
It is my honor to recognize Jessica 
for taking the bold initiative to pursue 
her dream and bring some much needed 
joy to the children of her community. 
As a teacher and a new entrepreneur,

TRIBUTE TO RAY PETERSEN 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to congratulate Mr. Ray Petersen on a 
remarkable 
career 
of 
indispensable 
service to the great State of Utah. By 
virtue of Ray’s enduring commitment 
to overseeing proper land management 
practices, Emery County flourishes 
with beauty and opportunity. The resi-
dents of Emery County and the count-
less visitors who enjoy the region have 
Ray to thank for his 18 years as Emery 
County’s Public Lands Administrator 
and his lifetime of public service to 
rural Utah. 
Ray has dedicated his career to ad-
dressing critical rural issues. As a 
fourth-generation resident of Emery 
County, Ray understands well the chal-
lenges facing rural communities and 
the profound impact that Federal, 
State, and local policy decisions have 
on the livelihoods of so many. In his 
role as Emery County Public Lands Ad-
ministrator, Ray was consequential in 
assisting policymakers, from the coun-
ty commission to the Federal Govern-
ment, reconcile differences and find so-
lutions for the county’s land manage-
ment, whose expansive plans fall heav-
ily under State and Federal domain. 
Sustained opportunity and access to 
Emery County’s lands are paramount 
for its economic vitality, particularly 
to its agriculture, recreation and tour-
ism industries, and its local mining, 
gas, and oil development. Ray has 
helped these key local industries navi-
gate the challenges and opportunities 
of land management issues, to find 
compromise and success. 
A fitting final accomplishment to his 
career, Ray was instrumental in help-
ing Utah’s congressional delegation se-
cure a victory for Emery County and 
the State’s public lands as the Emery 
County Public Lands Management Act 
was signed into law. This legislation 
marked the culmination of years of 
collaboration and cooperation with 
local partners and officials, ensuring 
ongoing uses will be enjoyed in Emery 
County without fear of a potential na-
tional monument designation from DC 
and consolidation of Utah trust lands 
that will generate millions in revenue 
for our school kids. It also included 
long-sought local land transfers to 
meet city government needs while ex-
panding Goblin Valley State Park, a 
truly unique place that will now be 
better managed for future generations. 
Ray Petersen has championed rural 
lands issues of extraordinary signifi-
cance to Utah throughout his esteemed 
career. Our great State owes him a 
debt of gratitude for three decades of 
selfless public service. 
Thank you, Ray. 
VERMONT STATE OF THE UNION 
ESSAY CONTEST FINALISTS 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
to have printed in the RECORD some of 
the finalist essays written by Vermont 
High School students as part of the 
10th annual ‘‘State of the Union’’ essay 
contest conducted by my office. 
The material follows: 
ETHAN MELLO, WOODSTOCK UNION HIGH 
SCHOOL, JUNIOR 
I believe that the most pressing issue fac-
ing our country today is the issue of afford-
able healthcare. This issue is unique to the 
United States among developed nations, but 
for years we have refused to take action. Not 
only 
could 
switching 
to 
a 
universal 
healthcare system lower costs, but could 
also ensure that, like the rest of the coun-
tries in the modernized world, the US insures 
all of its citizens as a human right. 
A universal healthcare system is a system 
where all of the inhabitants of a country are 
guaranteed healthcare at no cost. The gov-
ernment pays for all medical bills, and the 
system makes sure that even the poor can be 
helped when they get sick. Government pay-
ing for healthcare means higher taxes, but 
no deductible costs. This system is a staple 
in most European countries, as well as in 
Canada. The US is one of the only major 
countries to not yet adopt this system. In 
fact, out of the 33 developed countries recog-
nized by The Balance financial website, 32 
have universal healthcare. The UN has ac-
cepted universal healthcare as the best 
choice for countries, and has a goal of world-
wide universal healthcare coverage by 2030. 
If the US keeps its current healthcare sys-
tem, they are unlikely to meet this goal. 
In our country the healthcare system is 
structured so that private companies provide 
insurance. However, his insurance often 
doesn’t encompass drug prices or certain 
other costs, and is not affordable by the 
poor. The US has a Medicaid system for some 
low income citizens, but this program does 
not apply to everyone who is unable to con-
sistently pay for healthcare this has led to 
over 30 million Americans choosing not to 
purchase healthcare, a dangerous choice if 
they get sick or need emergency operations. 
Our system also allows insurance companies 
to jack up prices to make profit, and allows 
prescription drug companies to charge out-
rageous amounts for cheap pills. The US had 
the highest insurance costs relative to GDP 
in the world. This cost has not made our life 
expectancy better either, as in that respect 
we are still worse off than we should be as 
the most powerful country in the world. 
Universal healthcare has proven very effec-
tive when it has been used in other coun-
tries. Universal healthcare lowers healthcare 
costs, and eliminates administrative costs 
due to the fact that it is completely run by 
one entity, the government. In the United 
States this lower cost of healthcare could 
not only boost the economy, but also allow 
for more social mobility for the lower class, 
and less earnings for the billionaire drug 
company executives. 
Changing the healthcare system of the 
United States to universal healthcare will 
not be an easy task, but it is one that is nec-
essary for the good of our country as well as 
the people in it. In the next election, we need 
to ensure we elect politicians who not only 
support universal healthcare, but are willing 
to fight for it. 
SALAMA MBILIZI, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, 
SENIOR 
‘‘Why should we study for a future that is 
being taken away from us? We demand a safe 
future is that really too much to ask?’’ asks 
climate activist Greta Thunberg. This young 
Swedish environmentalist has gained inter-
national attention for her concerns about 
climate change. 
I am a girl from Africa who came to the 
U.S. as a refugee and I don’t want to become 
a ‘‘climate refugee,’’ like people in California 
who have lost homes due to fire. Climate 
change first created droughts in California, 
which lasted over a decade according to Cli-
mate Central. There is an 80 percent chance 
of a multi-decade-long drought by 2100. 
Human activities, such as burning fossil 
fuels, cause climate change. Exhaust gases 
from cars, uncontrolled factory releases, 
burning of low-quality coal for heating, even 
airplanes and ships create air pollution. We 
should reduce the use of oil and gas, and use 
alternative energy sources such as wind and 
solar power. 
The government should start investing 
more in public transportation, which can re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions because fewer 
people will have to drive and we can reduce 
air pollution. According to Energy News Net-
work, ‘‘Public transit produces significantly 
less air pollution per passenger mile than a 
standard car carrying a single driver. Buses 
emit 20% less carbon monoxide, 10% as much 
hydrocarbons, and 75% as much nitrogen ox-
ides per passenger mile than an automobile 
with a single occupant.’’ Smarter public 
transportation will increase ridership, cut 
the number of cars on the road, reduce traf-
fic, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. We 
could also recycle more plastics and stop 
cutting down forests. Unless we change our 
behaviors, global warming will continue and 
we will continue to experience weather ex-
tremes, forest fires, and massive pollution. 
When 195 nations met in 2015, they agreed 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part 
of the landmark Paris Agreement. The 
United States later backed out of that agree-
ment but states and cities are still inter-
ested. I call on Congress to pass and support 
legislation to help our environment by hon-
oring the Paris Agreement! 
I have a personal interest because climate 
change affects my life as well as our planet. 
If we don’t change our behavior, we will suf-
fer and some of us will die. Already, animals 
are going extinct at an alarming rate, reduc-
ing the balance in our world and the quality 
of our life. 
Scientists say that if we don’t stop pollu-
tion and greenhouse gases, Earth will be here 
for only a few hundred years. But if we can 
reduce greenhouse gases, Earth can remain 
okay for a million more years. Think about 
what will happen to us, your children and 
grandchildren. I want to be here for as many 
years as I can, enjoying this world I live in.

JUNIOR 
VACCINES CAUSE ADULTS 
The law dictates a child as property until 
the age of 18. While this is usually for the 
good of the child, what does it mean for the 
fate of children with misinformed parents? 
Anti-vax is a deadly philosophy of being 
against vaccinations, a philosophy that gets 
children killed. While yes, children are pro-
tected from abuse and neglect under Child 
Protective Services, there is no law to pro-
tect them from their own parent’s ideas. 
Parent’s can avoid federally required vac-
cines under religious or superstitious reasons 
in 45 of the 50 states (NCSL). However, when 
the safety of the public is at stake, the anti- 
vax culture becomes a truly worldwide epi-
demic. 
The confusion comes from a defrocked 
former doctor, Andrew Wakefield, who first 
proposed 
the 
vaccine/autism 
connection 
(Ruth). The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) did an inquiry in 2001 to address the

accusations, and found no connection to au-
tism in vaccines. Another complaint isolated 
the mercury in vaccines. Vaccines contain 
small amounts of mercury to form thimer-
osal, a preservative. These small amounts 
aren’t any more than the amount in 3 ounces 
of tuna fish. Nonetheless, the FDA at-
tempted lowering the amount of mercury in 
vaccines, but still saw no relief in rising au-
tism numbers. In 2004, 10 out of the 13 au-
thors on Wakefield’s paper retracted their 
hypothesis (Mayor). Then in 2010, the med-
ical journal ‘‘The Lancet’’ retracted Wake-
field’s paper, calling several elements incor-
rect. America can now agree vaccines should 
be made mandatory (Dyer). 
Medical marvels have continued to raise 
humanity to higher levels of immunity, 
causing fatal diseases to go nearly extinct. 
These include measles, mumps, rubella, 
polio, chickenpox, and smallpox. However, 
they still remain only ‘‘nearly extinct.’’ 
Modern day preventable diseases have yet to 
fade from America due to anti-vax. One 
study performed in 1982, watched 25 vac-
cinated and 25 unvaccinated children for the 
first 5 years of their lives. The result? One 
vaccinated child had mild measles but didn’t 
die, while the unvaccinated children saw 14 
deaths by measles and one of tetanus 
(Epoke). The Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention reports that 2018 has had more 
measles outbreaks than any year this dec-
ade, and they typically start in unvaccinated 
groups (CDC). 
Vaccines should be mandatory. Schools 
have begun to act on this already by requir-
ing their students to be vaccinated to at-
tend. In Australia, parents will be charged 
every 2 weeks A$28 (roughly 20 USD) for hav-
ing unvaccinated children, per child (Pasha- 
Robinson). These laws are something that 
should be present in the United States. The 
flu shot is already absolutely free with most 
health 
insurances, 
showing 
how 
rec-
ommended it is. This science has been 
around for a long time, and only recently, 
thanks to the internet’s easily accessible 
misinformation, has it been verbally con-
tested. We must make vaccines mandatory 
to protect our country from preventable dis-
eases. Yours or someone else’s life may de-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4225 
July 2, 2020 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I 
am pleased to be joined by my col-
league from West Virginia, Senator 
JOE MANCHIN, in introducing the Ad-
vancing Uniform Transportation Op-
portunities for Veterans Act. Our bill, 
known as the AUTO Act, would lessen 
the financial burden for severely dis-
abled veterans who require special 
adaptive equipment to drive a motor 
vehicle by increasing the access to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs auto-
mobile grant program. 
The VA is currently authorized to 
provide eligible veterans with a one- 
time grant of approximately $21,400 to 
be used to purchase a new or used auto-
mobile and necessary adaptive equip-
ment, such as specialized pedals or 
switches. This grant is often used to-
gether with the VA special adaptive 
equipment grants, which help veterans 
purchase adaptive equipment, such as 
powered lifts, for an existing auto-
mobile or van to make it safe for a vet-
eran’s use. 
Although veterans can receive mul-
tiple special adaptive equipment grants 
over the course of their lives, they are, 
for some reason, limited to a single 
grant for the vehicle. The current limi-
tation fails to take into account that a 
disabled veteran will need more than 
one vehicle in his or her lifetime. In 
fact, the Department of Transportation 
reports that the average useful life of a 
vehicle is 11.5 years, and a vehicle that 
has been modified structurally tends to 
have a shorter useful life. 
According to the VA Independent 
Budget prepared by the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of 
America, and the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, the average cost to replace modi-
fied vehicles ranges from $40,000 to 
$65,000 when the vehicle is new and 
$21,000 to $35,000 when the vehicle is 
used. These are significant costs for a 
severely disabled veteran to bear to re-
place his or her primary mode of trans-
portation. That is why veterans should 
be eligible to receive an automobile 
grant once every 10 years. Our bipar-
tisan bill would do exactly that. 
One disabled veteran in Maine, Neal 
Williams, from Shirley, used a VA 
automobile grant in 1999 to purchase 
an adapted vehicle—a Ford Econoline 
van. He has had to purchase several 
adaptive vehicles since 1999, with each 
one lasting 250,000 miles, until they 
were no longer roadworthy. Two hun-
dred and fifty thousand miles is a lot of 
miles, particularly over Maine’s roads 
and highways. Neal’s current vehicle 
now has over 100,000 miles, and he prob-
ably only has a short time before he 
will need a new one. He told me that 
purchasing a new van, which he uses 
for his wheelchair, and then he trans-
fers to the driver’s seat—he is such an 
extraordinary person in what he is able 
to do, but he has told me that new van 
will cost him well over $50,000, which is 
more than he paid for his home in rural 
Maine. 
This is an enormous burden on vet-
erans like Neal who need to purchase 
expensive adaptive vehicles in order to 
drive safely and, also, in order to main-
tain their independence. 
Our Nation owes American veterans 
our deepest gratitude. We must con-
tinue to honor that commitment to our 
veterans by supporting their needs, in-
cluding the needs of disabled veterans 
who need adaptive technology for their 
vehicles long after they are discharged 
or retired from Active Duty. The AUTO 
for Veterans Act is an important step 
in helping those who have served our 
Nation so honorably and have sac-
rificed so much for our freedom. 
I urge all of our colleagues to join 
Senator MANCHIN and me in honoring 
and supporting our Nation’s disabled 
veterans. 
I send the bill to the desk.

will be received and appropriately re-

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. HASSAN): 
S. 4173. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a cred-
it to small employers for covering mili-
tary spouses under retirement plans; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. President, I rise today, along 
with my colleague Senator HASSAN, to 
introduce the Military Spouses Retire-
ment Security Act. This bipartisan bill 
would help spouses of active duty serv-
ice members save for retirement by ex-
panding access to employer-sponsored 
retirement plans. 
According to the Employee Benefits 
Research Institute, American house-
holds face a retirement savings gap of 
$3.7 trillion. The Center for Retirement 
Research estimates an even larger gap 
of $7.1 trillion. When asked about their 
retirement preparedness, only 57 per-
cent of Americans believe they will be 
able to live comfortably in retirement. 
There are many reasons why Amer-
ican households struggle to save for re-
tirement, including the shift away 
from employer-based ‘‘defined benefit’’ 
plans and rising health care and long- 
term care costs. Longer life spans in-
crease the risk of outliving retirement 
savings. The economic and health im-
pacts of the COVID–19 crisis are also 
posing a threat to retirement security. 
Spouses of active duty service mem-
bers face an additional hurdle to saving 
for retirement. According to the De-
partment of Defense, about one-third of 
military service members experience a 
permanent change of station move 
every year. When a service member 
moves, their spouse often relocates 
with them, putting their own career on 
hold. 
Following a move, a military spouse 
may face periods of unemployment, 
where they are not able to participate 
in an employer-sponsored retirement 
plan. A 2017 survey found that the un-
employment rate for active duty mili-
tary spouses was 24 percent, more than 
five times the rate for the U.S. popu-
lation as a whole at that time. 
When military spouses find a new 
job, they often work part-time, despite 
preferring full-time work, or are only 
able to spend a few years with their 
employer before moving again. Their 
limited hours and short tenure often 
preclude them from being eligible to 
receive employer contributions to their 
retirement plan or from being fully 
vested in their plan. 
Increasing access to employer-spon-
sored retirement plans would improve 
the financial security of many military 
spouses. The bill I am introducing 
today would help address this need by 
providing a tax credit to small employ-
ers who provide military spouses with 
accelerated eligibility for retirement 
plan participation, employer contribu-
tions, and vesting. 
My bill would allow small employ-
ers—those with up to 100 employees—to 
claim a tax credit of up to $500 per year 
per military spouse. The credit would 
be available for three years per mili-
tary spouse. The amount of the credit 
would be equal to $200 per military 
spouse, plus 100 percent of all employer 
contributions for that spouse, up to 
$300. 
To receive the tax credit, small em-
ployers must make a military spouse 
immediately eligible for retirement 
plan participation within two months 
of hire. Upon plan eligibility, a mili-
tary spouse must be eligible for any 
matching or non-elective contribution 
available to a similarly situated em-
ployee with at least two years of serv-
ice, and must be 100 percent imme-
diately vested in all employer con-
tributions. 
Military spouses are the unsung he-
roes of our country’s national defense. 
They often put their professional lives 
on hold, threatening their long-term 
retirement 
security. 
The 
Military 
Spouses 
Retirement 
Security 
Act 
would help by encouraging small em-
ployers to provide military spouses 
with accelerated access to retirement 
plans and employer contributions. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. DAINES, 
Mr. JONES, and Mr. TESTER): 
S. 4174. A bill to provide emergency 
appropriations to the United States 
Postal Service to cover losses related 
to the COVID–19 crisis and to direct 
the Board of Governors of the United 
States Postal Service to develop a plan 
for ensuring the long term solvency of 
the Postal Service; to the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs. 
Mr. President, I rise to introduce the 
Postal Service Emergency Assistance 
Act. I am pleased to be joined by my 
colleague, Senator FEINSTEIN, in spon-
soring this legislation that would en-
sure the United States Postal Service 
survives the COVID–19 pandemic and 
advance the conversation needed to put 
it on a path to long-term solvency. I 
would also like to recognize Senators 
DAINES, JONES, and TESTER, who have 
joined as original cosponsors. 
Throughout its 245–year history, the 
United 
States 
Postal 
Service 
has 
played a vital role in bringing our 
country together and moving our econ-
omy forward. The Postal Service al-
lows us to remain connected with fam-
ily and friends and helps small busi-
nesses reach their customers around 
the country. 
The 
Postal 
Service 
is 
also 
the 
linchpin of a $1.6 trillion mailing indus-
try that employs more than 7.3 million 
people. These jobs are as varied as 
paper manufacturers, publishing, print-
ing, catalog companies, online retail-
ers, and transportation providers. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has changed 
our daily lives in fundamental ways, 
and the Postal Service is needed now 
more than ever. USPS is a lifeline for 
Americans across the country, particu-
larly seniors and others living in rural 
areas. In a Harris poll conducted in 
May, Americans ranked the USPS as 
the most ‘‘essential’’ company amid 
the pandemic. 
The agency’s dedicated employees, 
like the rural letter carrier in Colum-
bia Falls, go to work each day, facing 
increased risk as they continue to en-
sure reliable delivery of needed pre-
scriptions, 
safety-net 
benefits, 
and 
other critical services that might oth-
erwise be unavailable. 
While COVID–19 has underscored the 
essential nature of the Postal Service, 
it has also caused significant declines 
in first-class and marketing mail reve-
nues and increased costs, as the Postal 
Service has taken additional steps to 
protect its employees and the public 
from the virus. 
Even with substantial increases in 
package volumes during the first phase 
of the pandemic, USPS estimates that 
COVID–19 will increase net losses and 
accelerate its cash crisis. If Congress 
does not act, the Postal Service warns 
it could run out of money for payroll 
within the next year. This would 
threaten its ability to continue pro-
viding essential services to the public, 
as well as support its 630,000 employees, 
including 3,300 in Maine. 
I am committed to ensuring this 
vital institution survives the COVID–19 
crisis and is positioned to support eco-
nomic recovery. The legislation we are 
introducing today would provide the 
Postal Service with up to $25 billion in 
emergency funding to cover COVID–19- 
related losses and other operational ex-
penses. 
The legislation also includes several 
safeguards to ensure these funds are 
used only for their intended purpose. 
The funds would be appropriated to a 
separate 
‘‘Postal 
Service 
COVID–19 
Emergency Fund’’ rather than the gen-
eral Postal Service Fund, and these 
funds would only be available until 
September 30, 2022. Prior to accessing 
these funds, the Postal Service would 
be required to certify in its quarterly 
and annual reports to the Postal Regu-
latory Commission that the expendi-
ture of any such funds is necessary to 
cover losses or expenses resulting from

the COVID–19 pandemic. The Postal 
Service would also be required to 
prioritize the purchase of personal pro-
tective equipment for its employees 
and conduct additional cleaning and 
sanitizing of its facilities and delivery 
vehicles. 
In addition to providing emergency 
relief, this legislation would clarify the 
terms and conditions of the $10 billion 
loan that Congress provided to the 
Postal 
Service 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security or CARES Act. 
Although the COVID–19 emergency is 
contributing to the Postal Service’s fi-
nancing challenges, it did not cause all 
of its financial problems. According to 
the Government Accountability Office, 
USPS lost about $78 billion from fiscal 
year 2007 through 2019. This is why the 
legislation we are introducing today 
would also require the new Postmaster 
General and the Board of Governors to 
present to Congress a plan to ensure 
the long-term solvency of the Postal 
Service. 
Growing up in Aroostook County, I 
experienced the essential nature of the 
United States Postal Service every 
day. As Chairman of the Senate Aging 
Committee, I’ve also seen the indispen-
sable role that the Postal Service plays 
for our nation’s seniors. The Postal 
Service 
Emergency 
Assistance 
Act 
would ensure the Postal Service is able 
to continue fulfilling its essential mis-
sion, while also providing for respon-
sible stewardship of taxpayer funds and 
laying the groundwork to put the Post-
al Service on a path to long-term via-
bility. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill.

S. 4181. A bill to establish a Library 
Stabilization Fund to respond to and 
accelerate 
the 
recovery 
from 
coronavirus; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, to help li-
braries respond to and recover from the 
COVID–19 pandemic and continue pro-
viding communities with needed serv-
ices, 
resources, 
technology, 
and 
broadband access, I am introducing the 
Library Stabilization Fund Act along 
with 
Senators 
BROWN, 
BOOKER, 
BLUMENTHAL, UDALL, CARDIN, WARREN, 
WHITEHOUSE, HEINRICH, VAN
HOLLEN, 
MENENDEZ, WYDEN, HIRANO, and MAR-
KEY. Our bill would provide the $2 bil-
lion the American Library Association 
has estimated is necessary for a library 
stabilization fund under the Institute 
of 
Museum 
and 
Library 
Services 
(IMLS). 
COVID–19 has wreaked havoc on 
every aspect of our daily lives. Librar-
ies, which anchor our local commu-
nities, are no exception. Local budget 
shortfalls have left libraries to grapple 
with severe cuts, furloughs of staff, and 
reduced operations just when commu-
nities need their services the most. In 
addition to providing additional re-
sources to enable schools to reopen 
safely, close the homework gap, and 
strengthen the social safety net, we 
need to invest in libraries to help our 
communities recover. 
Libraries are a critical piece of our 
education, economic development, and 
social infrastructure. Although many 
libraries remain closed or have limited 
hours, libraries are meeting urgent 
community needs by increasing tech-
nology access (including boosting WIFI 
and lending hotspots, tablets, and com-
puters), offering digital content, pro-
viding books and materials for delivery 
or pick-up, and hosting online story 
times, classes, and discussion groups. 
In this way, libraries are providing en-
richment to our young people, ensuring 
students can connect to remote and 
summer learning, enabling those with 
jobs to telework, helping job seekers 
find employment and receive training, 
and offering a lifeline to vulnerable 
adults and seniors who need health in-
formation, a portal to government 
services, and ways to avoid social isola-
tion. 
To strengthen the ability of libraries 
to 
serve 
communities 
affected 
by 
COVID–19, our bill would provide fund-
ing to states on a formula basis, with a 
minimum allotment of $10 million; to 
tribes; and on a competitive basis. The 
funding could be used to support gen-
eral operations, including paying staff 
and ensuring the safe handling of li-
brary materials; to offer greater access 
to technology, including expanding 
digital networks and enabling the pur-
chase and lending of hotspots, laptops, 
and digital resources; to strengthen 
services and resources, including those 
relating to literacy, distance learning, 
adult education, workforce and eco-
nomic development, and health infor-
mation; and to link patrons to govern-
ment, community, and cultural re-
sources. 
This legislation will help ensure li-
braries can continue to find new ways 
to bridge the digital divide and safely 
provide 
information, 
programming, 
and services that people of all ages 
need to stay engaged and informed. 
This smart investment in our libraries 
will keep people and communities con-
nected and contribute to our economic 
recovery. 
I thank the supporters of the bill, in-
cluding the American Library Associa-
tion; Association for Rural & Small Li-
braries; Association of Research Li-
braries; Chief Officers of State Library 
Agencies; Common Sense Media: Inter-
national 
Dyslexia 
Association; 
Na-
tional 
Association 
of 
Elementary 
School Principals; National Associa-
tion of Secondary School Principals; 
National Coalition for Literacy; Na-
tional Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-
tional Humanities Alliance; National 
League of Cities; Reach Out and Read; 
Reading Is Fundamental; and Urban 
Libraries Council. Companion legisla-
tion is being introduced on a bipartisan 
basis in the other body by Congress-
man ANDY LEVIN. 
I urge our colleagues to join us in 
pressing for the inclusion of the Li-
brary Stabilization Fund Act in the 
next COVID–19 response package. 
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and 
Mr. MERKLEY): 
S. 4189. A bill to provide for drought 
preparedness and improved water sup-
ply reliability; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the Water for Agri-
culture and Conservation Act to help 
expand critical water conservation in-
frastructure that helps improve water 
use efficiency, fish and wildlife habitat, 
and agriculture productivity. 
Throughout the West, communities 
are experiencing high levels of drought 
that are hurting agriculture and con-
servation efforts. The Water for Con-
servation and Farming Act aims to 
help communities better plan and pre-
pare for the increased demand for clean 
water by funding projects that improve 
dam safety, create more resilient wa-
tersheds, and benefit agricultural and 
urban water users. 
States, Tribes, and local commu-
nities are working diligently to up-
grade crumbling water infrastructure 
but have lacked the critical resources 
to 
make 
meaningful 
improvements 
that last. The Water for Conservation 
and 
Farming 
Act 
would 
provide 
$120,000,000 over three years for dis-
advantaged communities to increase 
environmental protections, support ag-
riculture, and make significant steps 
to improve the water supply for their 
communities. 
The Water for Conservation and 
Farming Act would create a Bureau of 
Reclamation fund of $300 million to 
support 
water 
recycling 
projects, 
water-use efficiency projects and dam 
safety projects, as well as expanding 
existing programs, like WaterSMART, 
to get more bang for the conservation 
buck. 
The bill would establish several new 
programs at the Bureau of Reclama-
tion, which are designed to help dis-
advantaged communities plan and im-
plement water conservation projects, a 
program to help farmers improve mi-
gratory bird habitat, and programs to 
implement aquatic ecosystem restora-
tion projects. 
At a time when the nation is suf-
fering increased droughts, when farm-
ers and ranchers are asked to do more 
with less, and critical habitats are suf-
fering from less and less water, this bill 
will make needed investments in water 
conservation infrastructure that re-
duces demand for water, improves bio-
diversity, and helps farmers and ranch-
ers plan and prepare for droughts. I 
look forward to getting this bill across 
the finish line.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4228 
July 2, 2020 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, 
Mr. PORTMAN, Mr. CASSIDY, Mr. 
DAINES, 
Ms. 
COLLINS, 
Ms. 
ERNST, 
Ms. 
MCSALLY, 
Mr. 
BRAUN, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 4199. A bill to amend titles XI, 
XVIII, and XIX of the Social Security 
Act to lower prescription drug prices in 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs, 
to improve transparency related to 
pharmaceutical 
prices 
and 
trans-
actions, to lower patients’ out-of-pock-
et costs, and to ensure accountability 
to taxpayers, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Prescription 
Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2020. 
This is a bill that I have been working 
on for the past 18 months. I made low-
ering prescription drug costs one of my 
top priorities as I resumed the role of 
Chairman of the Finance Committee at 
the beginning of this Congress. 
I made it my priority as it’s a top 
concern for Iowans and all Americans. 
My constituents throughout the state 
voice concern about being able to af-
ford their prescription medications. I 
hear about this issue as much as any 
other. Poll after poll shows that the 
concern I hear in Iowa is shared across 
the Nation. The need for Congress to 
act to provide patients with much- 
needed 
relief 
is 
also 
a 
common 
takeaway from these polls and from 
talking to my colleagues. Iowans want 
action. Americans want action. 
Lowering prescription drug costs and 
providing relief to patients is actually 
what this bill does. 
For the vast majority of my time 
working on the bill, the Senator from 
Oregon, Ranking Member WYDEN, has 
been my partner. All of the policies in 
this bill, which improve Medicare and 
Medicaid and bring much needed trans-
parency across the supply chain, were 
co-authored by the Ranking Member. 
The Finance Committee reported the 
initial version of this robust bill in 
July 2019 by a vote of 19–9. I worked 
with Ranking Member WYDEN and oth-
ers to make bipartisan improvements 
to the bill. These improvements have 
made an already good bill better. I’m 
introducing this updated version today. 
It remains a truly bipartisan bill. 
It’s a bipartisan bill that helps pa-
tients and reduces government spend-
ing. According to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office, the bill would 
save seniors and Americans with dis-
abilities $72 billion in out-of-pocket 
costs in Medicare Part D and reduce 
premiums by $1 billion. The entire bill 
would save taxpayers nearly $100 bil-
lion—a rare source of bipartisan budget 
savings in an era of trillion dollar defi-
cits. Even Americans in the commer-
cial market would see savings. 
It’s a bipartisan bill that helps pa-
tients, reduces Federal spending, and 
lowers commercial costs. That’s a rare 
feat. It’s something of which we should 
all be proud. 
So why is the bill only being intro-
duced with Republicans as co-sponsors? 
The reason, unfortunately, is that 
the Democrats recently walked away 
from the bill. They walked away from 
the good faith negotiations that pro-
duced this bipartisan product. They did 
so for political reasons. They put poli-
tics, and their drive for power, ahead of 
patients. From conversations I have 
had with colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle, this was a leadership-driv-
en decision. Maybe the thinking is that 
they’ll block Senate Republicans from 
securing a win, or that they’ll be able 
to say that President Trump hasn’t fol-
lowed through. 
They can say that, but it doesn’t 
make it true. The introduction of this 
bill, with a number of my Republican 
colleagues, shows that Republicans are 
the ones on the side of patients. And to 
question the commitment of President 
Trump to lowering prescription drug 
prices is outlandish. 
President Trump campaigned on ex-
panding prescription drug affordability 
and fairness. He released a comprehen-
sive plan that included numerous pol-
icy ideas. He and his Administration 
have taken bold regulatory action. 
Some of those actions are being fought 
in the courts by stakeholders that sup-
port the status quo. Some have been 
opposed by Congressional Democrats. 
As the Administration’s ability to 
act through regulation can only take 
us so far, President Trump called on 
Congress to pass an overhaul of the 
drug pricing system. In fact, he men-
tioned my work on this specific bill in 
his State of the Union address earlier 
this year, and he called on Congress to 
send a bipartisan bill to his desk. 
We should be celebrating the intro-
duction of this bill today as another 
key step closer to responding to Presi-
dent Trump’s call for bipartisan action. 
While it remains the most prominent 
reform bill that contains bipartisan 
policy solutions, today’s introduction 
reveals that Democrats are more inter-
ested in positioning for elections than 
producing results. This is disappointing 
to me. But it makes clear to the Amer-
ican people that they can count on Re-
publicans to take action on the issues 
that are important to them. 
President Trump has worked harder 
to lower prescription drug prices than 
any President in memory. He has stood 
up to special interests. I, along with 
my colleagues cosponsoring this bill, 
and other Republicans, stand with him. 
I only wish my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle were as committed. I 
urge that they stop the political pos-
turing and work in a bipartisan way to 
deliver the relief that Iowans and all 
Americans deserve. 
I yield the floor.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
645—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
MOB 
VIOLENCE 
SHOULD BE CONDEMNED 
Mr. LEE (for himself, Mr. BRAUN, and 
Mr. JOHNSON) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary.: 
S. RES. 645 
Whereas the United States of America was 
founded in 1776 on universal principles of 
freedom, justice, and human equality; 
Whereas throughout our nation’s history, 
Americans have struggled to realize those 
ideals, falling short, as imperfect human 
beings always do, but nonetheless making 
greater progress toward them than any na-
tion on earth; 
Whereas the United States is today, as 
ever, an ethnically, racially, religiously, and 
culturally diverse nation, morally com-
mitted to cultivating respect, friendship, and 
justice across all such differences, and pro-
tecting the God-given equal rights of all 
Americans under the law; 
Whereas America’s law enforcement offi-
cers do an extremely difficult job extremely 
well, and despite the inexcusable misconduct 
of some, the overwhelming majority of such 
officers are honest, courageous, patriotic, 
and rightfully honored public servants; 
Whereas in recent weeks, people across the 
United States have organized legitimate, 
peaceful, constitutionally protected dem-
onstrations against instances of police bru-
tality and racial inequality, serious prob-
lems meriting investigation and reform; 
Whereas some Americans, unsatisfied with 
peaceful and positive demonstrations, have 
instigated and indulged in mob violence and 
criminal property destruction, not in service 
of any just or coherent cause, but simply as 
an arrogant, bullying tantrum of self-right-
eous illiberalism and rage; and 
Whereas these mobs have demonstrated 
not only contempt for public safety (as evi-
denced, 
among 
other 
crimes, 
by 
an 
unprovoked physical assault on a Wisconsin 
State Senator and the shooting of a motorist 
in Provo, Utah) and common decency (as evi-
denced by their routine harassment and ob-
scene berating of law enforcement officers 
standing their posts to protect their commu-
nities), but also their manifest ignorance and 
historical illiteracy (as evidenced by their 
destruction of public memorials to historical 
heroes like Ulysses S. Grant, St. Junipero 
Serra, 
Miguel 
Cervantes, 
George 
Wash-
ington, Hans Christian Heg, and a reported 
plan to target a statue of Abraham Lincoln 
financed in 1876 entirely by private dona-
tions from freed African-American slaves): 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the rising tide of vandalism, mob vio-
lence, and the mob mentality that feeds it— 
including its cruel and intolerant ‘‘cancel 
culture’’—should be condemned by all Amer-
icans; 
(2) peaceful demonstrations and mob vio-
lence are different in kind; 
(3) physical assault and property destruc-
tion are not forms of political speech but 
violent crimes whose perpetrators should be 
prosecuted to the full extent of the law; and 
(4) the innocent law enforcement officers, 
public officials, and private citizens who suf-
fer the mob’s violence and endure its scorn 
while protecting our communities from them 
deserve the thanks and appreciation of every 
American.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4231 
July 2, 2020 
SENATE RESOLUTION 646—RECOG-
NIZING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM 
IN THAILAND 
Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr. 
CARDIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.: 
S. RES 646 
Whereas the Kingdom of Thailand and the 
United States of America first established 
relations in 1818 and entered into the Treaty 
of Amity and Commerce in 1833; 
Whereas the Fulbright Program is spon-
sored by the Bureau of Educational and Cul-
tural Affairs of the Department of State; 
Whereas the Fulbright Program currently 
operates in over 150 countries; 
Whereas the Thailand-United States Edu-
cational Foundation (TUSEF) was estab-
lished by a formal agreement in 1950; 
Whereas 2020 is the 70th anniversary of the 
Fulbright Program partnership with the 
Kingdom of Thailand; 
Whereas, recognizing the value of bilateral 
exchange, the Government of Thailand has 
financially contributed to the binational 
TUSEF annually since 1989; 
Whereas nearly 2,000 Fulbright students 
and scholars from Thailand have studied, 
conducted research, or lectured in the United 
States since TUSEF’s founding; 
Whereas over 1,300 Fulbright grantees from 
the United States conducted research or 
gave lectures in Thailand since TUSEF’s 
founding; and 
Whereas the United States Government 
supports additional programs in Thailand in 
the areas of education, rule of law, and inter-
nationally recognized human rights: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and commends the 70th anni-
versary of the Fulbright Program in Thai-
land; and 
(2) encourages the President to maintain 
and expand interaction with the Kingdom of 
Thailand in ways that facilitate close coordi-
nation and partnership in the areas of edu-
cation and cultural exchange throughout all 
of Thailand and the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 647—RECOG-
NIZING THE FORTHCOMING CEN-
TENNIAL 
OF 
THE 
1921 
TULSA 
RACE MASSACRE 
Ms. WARREN (for herself, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. 
BROWN, Mr. CASEY, Mr. COONS, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. DURBIN, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Ms. HARRIS, 
Mr. KAINE, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. 
SANDERS, Ms. SMITH, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, 
Mr. WARNER, and Mr. WHITEHOUSE) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 647 
Whereas, in the early 20th century, de jure 
segregation confined Tulsa’s Black residents 
into the ‘‘Greenwood District’’, which they 
built into a thriving community with a na-
tionally renowned entrepreneurial center 
known as the ‘‘Black Wall Street’’; 
Whereas, at the time, white supremacy and 
racist violence were common throughout the 
United States and went largely unchecked 
by the justice system; 
Whereas reports of an alleged and disputed 
incident on the morning of May 30, 1921, be-
tween two teenagers, a Black man and a 
white woman, caused the white community 
of Tulsa, including the Tulsa Tribune, to call 
for a lynching amidst a climate of white ra-
cial hostility and white resentment over 
Black economic success; 
Whereas, on May 31, 1921, a mob of armed 
white men descended upon Tulsa’s Green-
wood District and launched what is now 
known as the ‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre’’; 
Whereas Tulsa municipal and county au-
thorities failed to take actions to calm or 
contain the violence, and civil and law en-
forcement officials deputized many white 
men who were participants in the violence as 
their agents, directly contributing to the vi-
olence through overt and often illegal acts; 
Whereas, over a period of 24 hours, the 
white mob’s violence led to the death of an 
estimated 300 Black residents, as well as over 
800 reports of injuries; 
Whereas the white mob looted, damaged, 
burned, or otherwise destroyed approxi-
mately 40 square blocks of the Greenwood 
district, including an estimated 1,256 homes 
of Black residents, as well as virtually every 
other structure, including churches, schools, 
businesses, a hospital, and a library, leaving 
nearly 9,000 Black Tulsans homeless and ef-
fectively wiping out tens of millions of dol-
lars in Black prosperity and wealth in Tulsa; 
Whereas, in the wake of the Tulsa Race 
Massacre, the Governor of Oklahoma de-
clared martial law, and units of the Okla-
homa National Guard participated in the 
mass arrests of all or nearly all of Green-
wood’s surviving residents, removing them 
from Greenwood to other parts of Tulsa and 
unlawfully detaining them in holding cen-
ters; 
Whereas Oklahoma local and State govern-
ments dismissed claims arising from the 1921 
Tulsa Race Massacre for decades, and the 
event was effectively erased from collective 
memory and history until, in 1997, the Okla-
homa State Legislature finally created a 
commission to study the event; 
Whereas on February 28, 2001, the commis-
sion issued a report that detailed, for the 
first time, the extent of the Massacre and 
decades-long efforts to suppress its recollec-
tion; 
Whereas none of the law enforcement offi-
cials nor any of the hundreds of other white 
mob members who participated in the vio-
lence were ever prosecuted or held account-
able for the hundreds of lives lost and tens of 
millions of dollars of Black wealth de-
stroyed, despite the Tulsa Race Massacre 
Commission confirming their roles in the 
Massacre, nor was any compensation ever 
provided to the Massacre’s victims or their 
descendants; 
Whereas government and city officials not 
only abdicated their responsibility to rebuild 
and repair the Greenwood community in the 
wake of the violence, but actively blocked 
efforts to do so, contributing to continued 
racial disparities in Tulsa akin to those that 
Black people face across the United States; 
Whereas the pattern of violence against 
Black people in the United States, often at 
the hands of law enforcement, shows that 
the fight to end State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people continues; and 
Whereas the year 2021 marks the 100th an-
niversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the forthcoming centennial 
of the Tulsa Race Massacre; 
(2) acknowledges the historical signifi-
cance of this event as one of the largest sin-
gle instances of State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people in American history; 
(3) honors the lives and legacies of the esti-
mated 300 Black individuals who were killed 
during the Massacre and the nearly 9,000 
Black individuals who were left homeless 
and penniless; 
(4) condemns the participants of the Tulsa 
Race Massacre, including white municipal 
officials and law enforcement who directly 
participated in or who aided and abetted the 
unlawful violence; 
(5) condemns past and present efforts to 
cover up the truth and shield the white com-
munity, and especially State and local offi-
cials, from accountability for the Tulsa Race 
Massacre and other instances of violence at 
the hands of law enforcement; 
(6) condemns the continued legacy of rac-
ism, including systemic racism, and white 
supremacy against Black people in the 
United States, particularly in the form of po-
lice brutality; 
(7) encourages education about the Tulsa 
Race Massacre, including the horrors of the 
massacre itself, the history of white suprem-
acy that fueled the massacre, and subsequent 
attempts to deny or cover up the Massacre, 
in all elementary and secondary education 
settings and in institutions of higher edu-
cation in the United States; and 
(8) recognizes the commitment of Congress 
to acknowledge and learn from the history of 
racism and racial violence in the United 
States, including the Tulsa Race Massacre, 
to reverse the legacy of white supremacy and 
fight for racial justice.

Whereas Congress passed the 19th Amend-

Whereas, from 1919 to 1920, the 66th Con-

ered, an amendment to the Constitution of

Whereas 
the 
ratification 
of

ment by 3⁄4 of the States, providing the sup-

Whereas August 26, 2020, marks the centen-

viding for women’s suffrage; and

RESOLUTION 
649—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF JULY 2020 AS 
‘‘AMERICAN 
GROWN 
FLOWER 
MONTH’’ 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. 
HARRIS, and Mr. SULLIVAN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 649 
Whereas cut flower growers in the United 
States are hard-working, dedicated individ-
uals who bring beauty, economic stimulus, 
and pride to their communities and the 
United States; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have a long history of using flowers and 
greens grown in the United States to bring 
beauty to important events and express af-
fection for loved ones; 
Whereas 
consumers 
spend 
almost 
$27,000,000,000 each year on floral products, 
including cut flowers, garden plants, bed-
ding, and indoor plants; 
Whereas, each year, nearly 30 percent of 
households in the United States purchase 
fresh cut flowers and greens from more than 
16,000 florists and floral establishments; 
Whereas the people of the United States in-
creasingly want to support domestically pro-
duced foods and agricultural products and 
would prefer to buy locally grown flowers 
whenever possible, yet a majority of domes-
tic consumers do not know where the flowers 
they purchase are grown; 
Whereas, in response to increased demand, 
the ‘‘Certified American Grown Flowers’’ 
logo was created in July 2014 in order to edu-
cate and empower consumers to purchase 
flowers from domestic producers; 
Whereas, as of April 2017, millions of stems 
of domestically grown flowers are now ‘‘Cer-
tified American Grown’’; 
Whereas domestic flower farmers produce 
thousands of varieties of flowers across the 
United States, such as peonies in Alaska, 
Gerbera daisies in California, lupines in 
Maine, tulips in Washington, lilies in Or-
egon, and larkspur in Texas; 
Whereas the five flower varieties produced 
in the largest quantities in the United States 
are tulips, Gerbera daisies, lilies, gladiolas, 
and irises; 
Whereas people in every State have access 
to domestically grown flowers, yet only one 
in five flowers sold in the United States is 
domestically grown; 
Whereas the domestic cut flower industry 
creates almost $42,000,000 in economic impact 
daily and supports hundreds of growers, 
thousands of small businesses, and tens of 
thousands of jobs in the United States; 
Whereas more people in the United States 
are expressing interest in growing flowers lo-
cally, which has resulted in an increase of 
approximately 20 percent in the number of 
domestic cut flower farms between 2007 and 
2012; 
Whereas most domestic cut flowers and 
greens are sold in the United States within 
24 to 48 hours after harvest and last longer 
than flowers shipped longer distances; 
Whereas flowers grown domestically en-
hance the ability of the people of the United 
States to festively celebrate weddings and 
births and honor those who have passed; 
Whereas flower giving has been a holiday 
tradition in the United States for genera-
tions; 
Whereas flowers speak to the beauty of 
motherhood on Mother’s Day and to the spir-
it of love on Valentine’s Day; 
Whereas flowers are an essential part of 
other holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christ-
mas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa; 
Whereas flowers help commemorate the 
service and sacrifice of members of the 
Armed Forces on Memorial Day and Vet-
erans Day; and 
Whereas the Senate encourages the cul-
tivation of flowers in the United States by 
domestic flower farmers: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of July 2020 as 
‘‘American Grown Flower Month’’; 
(2) recognizes that purchasing flowers 
grown in the United States supports the 
farmers, small businesses, jobs, and economy 
of the United States; 
(3) recognizes that growing flowers and 
greens in the United States is a vital part of 
the agricultural industry of the United 
States; 
(4) recognizes that cultivating flowers do-
mestically enhances the ability of the people 
of the United States to festively celebrate 
holidays and special occasions; and 
(5) urges all people of the United States to 
proactively showcase flowers and greens 
grown in the United States in order to show 
support for the flower farmers, processors, 
and distributors in the United States as well 
as agriculture in the United States overall.

Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr. 
BURR) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 650 
Whereas many people in the United States 
maintain classic automobiles as a pastime 
and do so with great passion and as a means 
of individual expression; 
Whereas the Senate recognizes the effect 
that the more than 100-year history of the 
automobile 
has 
had 
on 
the 
economic 
progress of the United States and supports 
wholeheartedly all activities involved in the 
restoration and exhibition of classic auto-
mobiles; 
Whereas the collection, restoration, and 
preservation of automobiles is an activity 
shared across generations and across all seg-
ments of society; 
Whereas thousands of local car clubs and 
related businesses have been instrumental in 
preserving a historic part of the heritage of 
the United States by encouraging the res-
toration and exhibition of such vintage 
works of art; 
Whereas automotive restoration provides 
well-paying, high-skilled jobs for people in 
all 50 States; and

Whereas the United States had led the for-
mation, as well as reform, of rules governing 
the multilateral trading system since World 
War II; 
Whereas the United States is a founding 
member of the World Trade Organization (in 
this preamble referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) and 
a key architect of the organization; 
Whereas the United States secured impor-
tant commitments in the WTO to facilitate 
trade in goods and services, to prevent the 
application of non-scientific restrictions on 
United States agriculture, and to protect 
United States intellectual property;

July 2, 2020 
consumers who live outside the borders of 
the United States; 
Whereas the fundamental purpose of the 
WTO is to create space for members to nego-
tiate with each other, and the WTO reserves 
to those members exclusively the right to 
negotiate and adopt rules that reduce and 
eliminate trade barriers and discriminatory 
treatment; 
Whereas the prompt settlement of disputes 
in which a member of the WTO considers 
that its rights are being impaired by the ac-
tions of another member is essential to the 
functioning of the WTO and the maintenance 
of a proper balance between the rights and 
obligations of members; 
Whereas the WTO’s dispute settlement 
function, including in particular the Appel-
late Body, has increasingly failed to enforce 
the rules of the WTO in a timely manner, 
and has usurped the negotiating prerogative 
of members by creating new obligations and 
rights that are inconsistent with the rules 
negotiated by members; 
Whereas the creation of those obligations 
and rights undermines— 
(1) the WTO’s negotiating function by dis-
couraging members from making conces-
sions; and 
(2) the WTO’s dispute settlement function 
by encouraging overuse of the process and 
undermining its legitimacy, including by 
preventing free market economies from re-
sponding to globally trade distortive prac-
tices by nonmarket economies; 
Whereas the WTO does not have sufficient 
rules to discipline the distortive economic 
policies of nonmarket economies, such as 
policies relating to excess capacity and 
forced technology transfer, the special treat-
ment those economies afford to state-owned 
enterprises, and their massive and opaque in-
dustrial subsidies; 
Whereas there is long-standing bipartisan 
support in the United States Congress to re-
form the WTO to address those failings; 
Whereas the current presidential adminis-
tration, as well as prior administrations, 
raised concerns about the failings described 
in this preamble and have made reform of 
the WTO a top priority of United States 
trade policy; 
Whereas the United States urges WTO 
members to work constructively with the 
United States to assess the reasons why the 
existing WTO rules have proven inadequate 
in order to create an atmosphere within the 
WTO that is conducive to the development of 
new rules less subject to jurisprudential 
drift; 
Whereas the guiding principle for reform of 
the WTO, and the lens through which WTO 
members should consider specific reform pro-
posals, is the restoration of the WTO’s capa-
bility and capacity for negotiation between 
members; and 
Whereas, given that the United States has 
achieved its trade policy objectives through 
active leadership at the WTO, and that an 
absence of that leadership would be filled by 
nonmarket economies that are hostile to a 
host of United States interests: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) while the United States finds value and 
usefulness in the World Trade Organization 
(in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) 
in order to fulfill the needs of the United 
States and other free and open economies in 
the 21st century, significant reforms are 
needed; 
(2) the United States must therefore con-
tinue to demonstrate leadership to achieve 
reforms that restore the effectiveness of the 
WTO’s— 
(A) negotiating function; 
(B) dispute settlement function so that it 
transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces 
outcomes negotiated by members rather 
than usurping their primacy by creating new 
rights or obligations; and 
(C) rules for special and differential treat-
ment to ensure those rules promote develop-
ment for truly disadvantaged countries, 
rather than becoming tools for globally com-
petitive countries to engage in protec-
tionism and market distortions; 
(3) the efforts to reform the negotiating 
function of the WTO should revitalize the ne-
gotiating function by providing confidence 
to members that the WTO operates accord-
ing to the rules as negotiated and adopted by 
members; 
(4) a revitalized negotiating function must 
include new rules that reflect the 21st cen-
tury economy, further combat anticompeti-
tive and protectionist barriers, and ensure 
disputes are efficiently resolved; 
(5) the United States Trade Representative 
should continue to lead efforts to work with 
WTO members to pursue reforms at the WTO 
that— 
(A) ensure the dispute settlement mecha-
nism faithfully applies the rules adopted by 
members, including by undertaking meas-
ures to ensure the WTO’s Appellate Body 
does not create new rights and obligations; 
(B) improve public confidence in dispute 
settlement by promoting greater trans-
parency and efficiency in the conduct of pro-
ceedings; 
(C) redress the consistent failure by cer-
tain members to satisfy their notification 
obligations under various WTO agreements, 
including through measures that strengthen 
accountability; 
(D) ensures rules for special and differen-
tial treatment are appropriately reserved for 
countries whose state of development and 
global competitiveness actually warrants 
such flexibility; 
(E) create new rules and structures that 
can serve the interests of the United States 
while promoting peace, prosperity, good gov-
ernance, transparency, effective operation of 
legal regimes, the rule of law, and free enter-
prise; and 
(F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations 
currently underway with Japan and the Eu-
ropean Union; and 
(6) the United States Trade Representative 
should explore and assess specific reform 
proposals, including— 
(A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that 
further the interests of the United States 
while limiting the benefits accruing to coun-
tries that are not parties to those agree-
ments; 
(B) efforts to ensure that incorrect inter-
pretations by the Appellate Body, including 
with respect to the Agreement on Safe-
guards, the Agreement on Implementation of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tar-
iffs and Trade 1994, and the Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are 
corrected, and not to be deemed preceden-
tial; 
(C) new rules and norms to address prac-
tices of nonmarket economies, such as prac-
tices relating to state-owned enterprises, 
which certain countries often utilize for ob-
jectives that cause severe trade distortions; 
and 
(D) better implementation of existing 
rules, such as the prohibition in paragraph 4 
of Article XIV of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade on currency manipulation, 
to ensure that those rules are effective to 
preserve the rights of free market econo-
mies.

SEC. 752. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE ARMED 
FORCES INSTITUTE FOR REGENERA-
TIVE MEDICINE. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the Armed Forces Institute for Regen-
erative Medicine (in this section referred to 
as ‘‘AFIRM’’) delivers critical regenerative- 
based technologies lead to functional and 
aesthetic recovery from injuries incurred 
during service in the Armed Forces; 
(2) AFIRM is a highly rated, nationally re-
spected public-private consortium leading 
the development of restorative therapies for 
battlefield trauma as part of several re-
search and development programs directed 
to meet defined medical technology gaps for 
warfighter groups; 
(3) the efforts by AFIRM span from re-
search and development to clinical trans-
lation, implementation, and commercializa-
tion, with therapies developed for extremity 
and craniofacial trauma, skin and genito-
urinary injuries, and transplantation; 
(4) each AFIRM project specifically ad-
dresses 
a 
key 
need 
of 
the 
wounded 
warfighter, which has helped guide research 
projects toward partnerships with industry 
that can be reviewed for approval and en-
tered into clinical trials for eventual place-
ment in the marketplace; 
(5) technologies developed by AFIRM in-
clude, in part, those that will result in the 
ability to generate and integrate functional 
composite 
tissue, 
neural 
pathways, 
vascularization, aesthetic skin, bone, and 
muscle; 
(6) despite the technology challenges, the 
public-private teaming approach to medical 
research and development used by AFIRM 
has resulted in more than 24 products reach-
ing clinical trials; 
(7) it is essential that Congress continue to 
provide the necessary resources to sustain 
the technology exploration, maturation, and 
transition in regenerative medicine set forth 
by AFIRM; and 
(8) the Senate highly encourages allocation 
of additional funds to AFIRM from the un-
distributed medical research funds provided 
in this Act to facilitate the continued imple-
mentation of the innovative consortium 
model used by AFIRM that has a proven 
track record of success. 
SA 2422. Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. COTTON, Mr. SASSE, Mr. 
CORNYN, Mr. BENNET, and Mr. BURR) 
submitted an amendment intended to 
be proposed to amendment SA 2301 pro-
posed by Mr. INHOFE to the bill S. 4049,

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS 
ENTERPRISE PROGRAM 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 2, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, in this histor-
ical moment, we are all working to find ways 
to eliminate racial injustice and the disparities 
it causes. Certainly, people of color must be 
treated with fairness and respect by law en-
forcement. But it will take far more than that 
to begin to make a dent in the race and sex 
discrimination that keeps far too many people 
locked out of the American dream. In this con-
text, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise 
or DBE Program, which is reauthorized in this 
legislation, is essential. As we have over the 
past decades since the DBE program was 
originally enacted in 1983, this Committee has 
received enormous amounts of evidence dem-
onstrating that discrimination continues to 
plague the industries that make up the surface 
transportation market. One of the studies ref-
erenced in our Committee Report involves the 
Nashville and the surrounding metropolitan 
area. The numbers are devastating—espe-
cially in prime contracting. Firms owned by Af-
rican Americans earned 3 cents on the dollar 
of what we would expect them to earn given 
their availability in Architecture and Engineer-
ing markets. For Asian Americans the number 
was 18 cents on the dollar and for Hispanic 
Americans it was 47 cents on the dollar. That 
is simply unacceptable. In construction con-
tracting, African Americans did better, but His-
panic Americans did much, much worse—and 
none did as well as white males. In prime con-
struction contracts, African American owned 
firms earned 55 cents on the dollar of what we 
would have expected given their representa-
tion in the availability for prime construction 
contracting. Asian Americans earned 25 cents 
on the dollar and Hispanic Americans earned 
1 cent on the dollar. Metro Nashville Ten-
nessee Disparity Study Final Report, Griffin 
and Strong, P.C., August 2018, at 83 through 
84. These numbers make clear that minority 
business owners in this country are trapped in 
a cycle of discrimination from which escape is 
close to impossible. We cannot permit this sit-
uation to continue. 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF BRIAN DAVIS AND HIS THIR-
TY-FIVE 
YEAR 
CAREER 
WITH 
THE 
CATTARAUGUS 
COUNTY 
SOIL 
AND 
WATER 
CONSERVA-
TION DISTRICT 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 2, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the retirement of Brian Davis, 
Cattaraugus County Soil and Water Conserva-
tion District Field Manager. 
Brian dedicated thirty years of his life to 
serving as the district field manager and 
oversaw a considerable amount of projects 
that ranged from agriculture to wildlife issues, 
as well as forest issues and streambank pro-
tection. Previously, he served as a technician 
with the conservation district for five years. 
His dedication to the cause of conservation 
has been evidenced by his hard work, suc-
cessful projects over the years and his enthu-
siasm for the task at hand. He has overseen 
millions of dollars of projects over the years 
that have aided businesses, farmers and high-
way superintendents across the area. These 
efforts have had a considerable impact on the 
district and have improved the environment in 
various ways. 
Brian has provided dedicated leadership 
during his tenure at the Cattaraugus County 
Soil and Water Conservation District and he 
will be missed by all. He leaves behind a leg-
acy of service and commitment that will be dif-
ficult to replace, however, he has certainly 
earned his retirement. We hope his next steps 
on this new path will be rewarding and bounti-
ful, as his contributions have been to the com-
munities he has served. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
congratulate Brian Davis of the Cattaraugus 
County Soil and Water Conservation District 
on his retirement.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF JAMESTOWN POLICE CHIEF 
HARRY SNELLINGS 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 2, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the retirement of Jamestown Police 
Chief Harry Snellings. 
Chief Harry Snellings has been with the 
Jamestown Police Department in Jamestown, 
New York since 1996. He began as a police 
officer, was promoted to Sergeant in 2004 and 
later, Lieutenant in 2009. In 2010, Harry took 
over as Chief of Police and Director of Public 
Safety. 
From 2001 to 2009, Harry was a member of 
the Special Weapons and Tactics team 
(S.W.A.T.), serving as a team leader and a 
team commander during that time. In 2011, he 
attended and graduated from the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation National Academy. 
Prior to his service as a police officer, Harry 
served in the United States Army for twenty- 
three years and was deployed three times. He 
selflessly dedicated his life to public service 
and public safety throughout his career, and 
has certainly earned his retirement. We ap-
plaud his efforts and wish him the best in the 
next chapters of his life. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
congratulate Chief Harry Snelling upon his re-
tirement.
