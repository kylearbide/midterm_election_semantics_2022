REMEMBERING AND CELEBRATING 
THE LIFE OF H.L. RICHARDSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, lost 
amidst the tumult of the last couple of 
weeks was the quiet passing of an out-
spoken leader of California, H.L. ‘‘Bill’’ 
Richardson. H.L., as he was known to 
his friends, arrived in the California 
State Senate with the freshman class 
of 1966, part of the Reagan landslide 
that year. 
For every one of the 22 years he 
served in the Senate, H.L. was a force 
to be reckoned with. He served for 
many years in the Republican leader-
ship, but he was never ever a political 
insider. His enormous influence inside 
the senate stemmed from the fact that 
he never joined that club; he never lost 
sight of the people who elected him. 
And he not only worked tirelessly to 
serve them inside the capitol, he 
worked even harder to organize, in-
form, and mobilize them outside the 
capitol. 
He founded a multitude of advocacy 
groups to empower the millions of Cali-
fornians who believed in individual lib-
erty and economic freedom. He started 
the Free Market Political Action Com-
mittee to support free market prin-
ciples and the candidates who em-
braced them, and it became the inspi-
ration and prototype of groups like the 
Club for Growth and Americans for 
Prosperity and FreedomWorks today. 
In the 1970’s, when Jerry Brown first 
came to power and appointed radical 
leftists to the California courts, H.L. 
founded the Law and Order Campaign 
Committee, which became the driving 
force between the historic recall of 
Chief Justice Rose Bird and two of her 
associates on the California Supreme 
Court. That organization went on for 
many years to restore common sense 
to the California courts and criminal 
justice system, including pressing the 
legislature to restore the death penalty 
over Jerry Brown’s veto. 
His passion for the Second Amend-
ment was his most defining cause. He 
founded Gun Owners of California to 
fight the growing movement in Cali-
fornia to disarm law-abiding citizens, 
and its success not only beat back 
Proposition 15, a 1982 initiative to ban 
handguns in California, it generated so 
many new Second Amendment voters 
in 
that 
election 
to 
put 
George 
Deukmejian over the top by a tiny 
margin of victory over Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley in that Governor’s 
race that year. Gun Owners of Cali-
fornia continues its good work to this 
day, as does its spin-off, Gun Owners of 
America. 
H.L. had a wicked sense of humor, 
and it was keenest when bursting bub-
bles of political pomposity. One of his 
half dozen published books, still re-
quired reading in some college classes, 
is titled, ‘‘What Makes You Think We 
Read 
the 
Bills?’’ 
His 
book, 
‘‘Confrontational Politics,’’ offers a 
civilized, but no less resolute, conserv-
ative 
response 
to 
Saul 
Alinsky’s 
‘‘Rules for Radicals.’’ 
California, once called ‘‘The Golden 
State,’’ is today drawing more and 
more attention as a slow-moving train 
wreck. The radical left has now domi-
nated the State’s institutions for more 
than 20 years, and California is show-
ing all of the political, social, and eco-
nomic 
pathologies 
that 
accompany 
leftist governance: failing schools; ris-
ing crime; chronic traffic congestion; 
skyrocketing costs of housing, energy, 
and water; rampant homelessness; op-
pressive regulations; the highest effec-
tive poverty rate in the Nation; and a 
population now fleeing to other States. 
Senator H.L. Richardson held back 
that tide for nearly 30 years. He was a 
mighty seawall that protected Cali-
fornia from the left, giving one final 
generation of Californians the joy of 
living in the most prosperous and beau-
tiful State in the Nation. 
But, as age took its toll, his influ-
ence waned, the left steadily advanced, 
and none of us whom he inspired to fol-
low him has been able to stop it. 
On 
January 
13, 
H.L. 
Richardson 
passed away at the age of 92, and with 
him passed the golden California of 
freedom, opportunity, and prosperity 
that he fought so hard, so long, and so 
effectively to preserve. Perhaps the day 
will come when California will see a re-
birth of freedom, and on that day, 
H.L.’s wisdom, courage, and leadership

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
EXTRAOR-
DINARY EFFORTS OF THREE AF-
RICAN AMERICAN WOMEN FROM 
ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as we celebrate Black History 
Month across our Nation. And I want 
to recognize the extraordinary efforts 
of three African American women from 
Rockford, Illinois, who have honorably 
served three separate branches of our 
Armed Forces. Our Nation is indebted 
to them. 
Later this week, the stories of Mar-
garet 
Patricia 
Whelcher, 
Lana 
McCants, and Milana Herman will be 
displayed to the public at the Veterans 
Memorial Hall and Museum in Rock-
ford, Illinois. 
Their contributions to our country 
have been chronicled by local students 
from Harlem High School as part of the 
annual Harlem Veterans Project, and 
they have conducted interviews, shot 
videos, 
and 
have 
photographs 
and 
more. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
moment to bring attention to their 
sacrifices and thank them for their 
service today. 
Margaret 
Patricia 
Whelcher, 
she 
served in the United States Air Force 
from 1988 to 1991 and achieved the rank 
of senior airman. 
Lana McCants, she served in the 
United States Navy from 1991 to 1997 
and achieved the rank of operation spe-
cialist 3rd class. 
Milana Herman served in the United 
States Army from 1989 to 1994 and 
achieved the rank of staff sergeant. 
In addition to their distinguished 
military service, these veterans have 
worked to better our community. Lana 
is an active member of the American 
Legion Post 340, while Margaret and 
Milana routinely participate in local 
stand-downs, where they offer a variety 
of support services for at-risk veterans. 
I am proud to see them represent our 
community with such distinction and 
such honor. Their selfless commitment 
to country and community sets a 
strong example for the leaders of to-
morrow. It is crucial that their inspira-
tional stories are spread far and wide. 
That is why I applaud the work of 
those students participating in the 
Harlem Veterans Project. These stu-
dents have sought to build a unique 
bond with members of the community 
and raise the voices of those around 
them. 
Institutions like the Veterans Memo-
rial Hall and Museum in Rockford, 
which will feature these incredible 
women, tell the stories of so many who 
have made an immense impact on the 
lives of those across our region. It is 
only fitting that the stories of Mar-
garet, Lana, and Milana will be dis-
played with the rest of them. 
We must never forget those who 
paved the path before us. Stories like 
theirs make up the very fabric of our 
Nation. They should be cherished and 
celebrated. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
COUNSELORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last week marked Na-
tional School Counselors Week. 
School counselors play a valuable 
role in the lives of our Nation’s stu-
dents. They help students navigate 
challenges, both academic and per-
sonal, through all phases of education. 
But some counselors truly go above 
and beyond. 
Recently, I had the pleasure of join-
ing the American School Counselor As-
sociation for a meeting, where I met 
Laura Ross, the 2020 School Counselor 
of the Year. Laura’s co-workers have 
called her a true hero and a champion 
for the work that she has done at Five 
Forks Middle School. 
School counselors like Laura have 
big responsibilities and even greater 
opportunities to make a difference in 
the lives of young people. When people 
choose to dedicate their careers to pro-
viding support and guidance for these 
students, they are better equipped to 
tackle personal and professional chal-
lenges and better prepared to enter the 
workforce. 
A successful career begins with a 
well-rounded view of what the work-
force entails. Effective counseling can 
assist learners in better understanding 
their educational opportunities and ca-
reer prospects, while preventing stu-
dents from taking on sizable debt. 
H.R. 5092, the Counseling for Career 
Choice Act, seeks to ensure high school 
students are made aware of their edu-
cational options and career prospects 
prior to graduation. To do that, the bill 
would establish a grant program for $40 
million to invest in career counseling 
programs for high school students. 
It also invests in professional devel-
opment opportunities for counselors 
working with these students so coun-
selors can do their jobs to the best of 
their ability and stay up to date on 
workforce trends and postsecondary 
opportunities. This includes 2- and 4- 
year degree programs, but that also in-
cludes certificate programs, intern-
ships, and apprenticeships. 
Mr. Speaker, we all owe a debt of 
gratitude to our Nation’s school coun-
selors. All year long, their service and 
support of our Nation’s young people is 
greatly appreciated. 
REMEMBERING 
THE 
BAKU 
PO-
GROMS THAT TOOK PLACE 30 
YEARS AGO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the Baku pogroms, 
which took place in January 1990, some 
30 years ago. The Baku pogroms rep-
resented the culmination of years of 
atrocities by the Azeris against ethnic 
Armenians living in Azerbaijani com-
munities, 
such 
as 
Sumgait 
and 
Kirovobad. 
Time and time again, Armenians fell 
victim to their neighbors, as gangs of 
Azeris roamed the streets, smashed 
windows, burned cars, and attacked 
any Armenians they found. The gangs 
murdered and mutilated some women 
and repeatedly raped others. 
In Baku, the pattern held, as looters 
destroyed property and tortured the 
murdered victims. Thousands of Arme-
nians fled the systemic violence, world 
chess champion Gary Kasparov’s fam-
ily counted among them. 
Mr. Speaker, Azerbaijan was engaged 
in a systemic effort to erase this his-
tory and silence those who repeat it. I 
rise today so that they cannot succeed. 
The history of this violence is one of 
the many reasons I believe that resi-
dents of Nagorno-Karabakh or Artsakh 
should be allowed to live in peace, free-
dom, and security. The United States 
has a crucial role to play in promoting 
this outcome. 
For decades, U.S. aid has helped clear 
mines in Artsakh, saving lives, pro-
moting development, and giving com-
munities a sense of normalcy. Today, 
even though the work is not done, that 
aid is threatened. 
Today, even though Armenia and 
Artsakh have embraced the Royce- 
Engel peace proposal, while Azerbaijan 
has rejected it, Artsakh could lose the 
mining assistance. And today, even 
though Armenia has transformed itself 
into a growing democracy, it is auto-
cratic Azerbaijan that has received a 
massive, 
disproportion 
increase 
in 
military aid from the United States. 
If the administration won’t help 
those who stand for peace and democ-
racy, Congress must. The legacy of 
Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovobad remind 
me why. We must fight for the memo-
ries of those we lost, for their dreams 
of safety and security, and for the 
promise of a free Artsakh. 
f 
RADICAL OPEN BORDERS POLICIES 
THAT ARE DANGEROUS TO OUR 
CITIZENS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to oppose a truly radical piece of legis-
lation that was recently introduced in 
this Chamber.

called, introduced with the support of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1021 
February 11, 2020 
more than three dozen Democratic co-
sponsors, decriminalizes illegal immi-
gration, makes it nearly impossible for 
border authorities to detain and deport 
immigrants with criminal convictions, 
and forces taxpayers to foot the bill to 
bring back previously deported crimi-
nal illegal immigrants. 
b 1015 
Mr. Speaker, if this bill were to be-
come law, it would enable illegal immi-
grants who have committed crimes 
abroad to be returned to the U.S., and 
it would allow them to gain a pathway 
to citizenship. 
The bill eliminates the provision in 
current law that forbids an immigrant 
from entering the United States if they 
have committed drug crimes or any 
crimes involving moral turpitude. Ex-
amples of crimes involving moral tur-
pitude include child molestation, kid-
napping, rape, murder, and more. It is 
unthinkable that we would allow any-
one who has committed those crimes to 
freely enter our country. 
To add to the egregiousness of this 
legislation, it calls on the Department 
of Homeland Security to pay for the re-
turn of previously deported illegal im-
migrants. Under the bill, any immi-
grant deported since April 1996 would 
be allowed to return to the U.S. as long 
as they met a stunningly lax set of cri-
teria. It is ridiculous to require Amer-
ican taxpayers to foot the bill to bring 
previously deported individuals back 
onto U.S. soil. 
The bill would make it more difficult 
for ICE to detain an immigrant with a 
criminal 
record. 
Agents 
would 
be 
forced to prove that a suspect poses a 
danger or a flight risk without using 
the immigrant’s past criminal history 
as a sole factor. 
One of the Democratic cosponsors on 
this bill even proclaimed that it would 
end deportation for people who had 
contact with the criminal legal system. 
I would say it is common sense that a 
serious criminal conviction should lead 
to deportation. 
Worse yet, this prevents ICE from de-
porting immigrants who have been con-
victed of crimes with an average sen-
tence of less than 5 years. This bill 
would allow an alien who committed 
crimes like auto theft, weapons crimes, 
identity theft, and fraud to remain in 
the country. 
Like many Americans, I want people 
to enter our country through the legal 
process—we want them here—and then 
to stay on the right side of the law. 
Legal immigration is what makes our 
country great. But we cannot pass 
bills, like this one, that incentivize 
more people to come here illegally or 
imposes no penalty on those who com-
mit serious crimes. 
I think most Americans would agree 
that we should welcome those who 
come to our land in a legal, merit- 
based way and that dangerous, illegal 
immigrants should not be allowed to 
come into our country or stay in our 
country. 
Unfortunately, this bill makes a 
mockery of that principle and replaces 
it with a set of radical, open-border 
policies that are dangerous to our citi-
zens and our communities. It is for 
that reason that it should be soundly 
defeated. 
f 
HONORING FALLEN SOLDIERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to honor and express 
my deepest sympathy, as a fellow 
Texan, to the family of Sergeant 1st 
Class Javier Gutierrez, who lost his life 
in battle in Afghanistan. I also want to 
acknowledge Sergeant 1st Class Anto-
nio Rodriguez of New Mexico, as he lost 
his life in battle as well. 
It is a war that is endless. Nonethe-
less, the service of our giants, our 
young men and women in uniform, is 
to be constantly honored. 
Sergeant Gutierrez, a family man, a 
husband, a father, engaged in the serv-
ice of his Nation, enthusiastically join-
ing. He came from a long legacy of 
service to the Nation: his grandfather, 
another hero in our Nation, and his fa-
ther, another hero in our Nation. 
I pray for this family, who has now 
given the ultimate sacrifice and never 
refused to put on the uniform to fight 
in battle for this Nation’s freedom, its 
justice, and its equality. 
May God bless his family, and may 
he rest in peace. 
DEFEAT PRESIDENT TRUMP’S PROPOSED BUDGET 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. As I move to an-
other topic, I would like to say that 
this is a message to my constituents 
and the American people. 
As you have heard in the news, and 
were probably frightened by the ex-
cerpts, I hold in my hand a budget for 
America’s future. This was offered by 
the President of the United States. It 
is frightening in its attack on the basic 
security, domestic security, of the 
American people. 
I would venture to say that even our 
young soldiers have found the need for 
their families to sometimes have as-
sistance with the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program, food stamps. 
Tragically, this budget digs deep to 
hatchet away the basic safety net that 
we have come to understand is not a 
handout for working families who may 
be impoverished but a hand-up. 
I am startled by the cuts, draconian 
cuts, in this document. I am startled 
by $1.6 trillion in cuts for Medicare and 
Medicaid. 
I am startled by, in the midst of the 
coronavirus, a more than $4 billion cut 
in funding for the NIH and the Centers 
for Disease Control, the very entities 
that provide lifesaving research and 
possible cures for the American people 
and people around the world. 
The World Health Organization is 
begging to go into China at this time, 
and they are looking to have American 
researchers who are ready and able to 
go, to determine how to stop, how to 
determine the origins, and how to 
thwart what might be a horrific pan-
demic around the world. How can you 
cut $4 billion? 
Then, the precious children in my 
congressional district, I have the privi-
lege of representing a number of school 
districts, not just one, but a good num-
ber of school districts. Every day, the 
administrators, teachers, and parents, 
dropping their beautiful children off, 
are looking for an opportunity so that 
they, too, might serve and contribute 
to this great Nation. Yet, a number 
that is so startling it takes your breath 
away: $6.2 billion in cuts for education. 
After Hurricane Harvey, with 51 tril-
lion gallons of floodwater, people are 
still suffering from the losses of their 
homes, still trying to fix flooding areas 
and mitigate the damage through in-
frastructure work. Yet, $1.7 billion has 
been cut from those needs of people 
who have experienced heinous and hor-
rific natural disasters and still need 
the repairs that are necessary. 
Of course, every child knows that cli-
mate change is real. So in this Na-
tion—the innovative, important leader 
of the world—we are slashing the dol-
lars for climate research. 
We are not aware as well, I guess, in 
this administration, that terrorism is 
on the rise, domestic terrorism in par-
ticular. But we must also be vigilant 
for the terrorism that brought down 
the Twin Towers on 9/11. Yet, those dol-
lars are being cut from FEMA, $746.9 
million. 
Then, let me say, as I close, that we 
are also saying to those who are 
unhoused, the homeless, those who 
seek better housing, that they, too, 
can’t get housing. Affordable housing 
for the homeless and others is now 
waning. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask to defeat this 
budget, as we will.

HONORING LITTLETON ALSTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Black History Month, I rise to recog-
nize Littleton Alston for his lifetime 
contributions 
in 
the 
fine 
art 
of 
sculpting, both as a renowned artist 
and as a professor. 
Littleton was born in Petersburg, 
Virginia, and grew up in northeast 
Washington, D.C., where he had his 
first encounter with great art and pub-
lic sculpture. He still vividly remem-
bers looking from his home down East 
Capitol Street and seeing the Capitol 
dome. 
His mother, who was divorced and 
raising five children on her own, ac-
knowledged and recognized a unique 
gift that Littleton seemed to possess: 
drawing. Her devotion and his talent 
helped him land an opportunity to at-
tend the Duke Ellington School of the 
Arts in Washington, D.C., where he 
graduated from high school.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1022 
February 11, 2020 
Awarded a scholarship to Virginia 
Commonwealth University in Rich-
mond, he received his bachelor of fine 
arts degree in sculpture and went on to 
earn his master of fine arts from the 
Maryland Institute College of Art’s 
Rinehart Graduate School of Sculpture 
in Baltimore. 
There, he was the recipient of the 
school’s 
top 
honor, 
the 
Rinehart 
Award. In 1989, he was accepted to the 
artist residency program at the Bemis 
Center 
of 
Contemporary 
Arts 
in 
Omaha. A year later, he joined the fac-
ulty of Omaha’s Creighton University, 
where he has attained the rank of full 
professor of sculpture. 
For the past 30 years, he has consist-
ently given back to the community. 
Littleton served on the Omaha Public 
Art Commission for 9 years, and he has 
volunteered often for local charities 
and community service groups. He is 
especially proud of his educational out-
reach, having often led classes and 
workshops at schools in low-income 
neighborhoods. 
In 2013, he was recognized by the city 
of Omaha for his artistic and civic con-
tributions with a Community Excel-
lence Award and by Governor Dave 
Heineman with the Community Devel-
opment Excellence Award. 
Littleton says he chose the art of 
sculpting because he believes sculpture 
is the best vehicle through which he 
can best express the joys and sorrows 
of the human condition. He says that 
he has explored many mediums and 
conceptual approaches. As an artist, he 
tries to convey the beauty and power of 
the sculpted form. 
Littleton Alston has been commis-
sioned to create a variety of sculptural 
projects, including monumental bronze 
figures such as: The Archangel Mi-
chael, Christ Among Children, Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Baseball Legend Bob 
Gibson, St. Ignatius of Loyola, and 
many others. 
His work has included international 
artist residencies. In 2019, Littleton 
was selected from applicants from 
across the country to create a larger- 
than-life-size bronze statue portraying 
Willa Cather, a sculpture that will be 
one of the two statues representing the 
great State of Nebraska in the U.S. 
Capitol. 
This achievement is a hallmark for 
our country and a homecoming for 
Littleton, who will become the first Af-
rican American artist to create a work 
to be displayed in the Statuary Hall 
collection, a compelling achievement, 
50 years in the making, for a young 
man who grew up in eyeshot of the 
Statue of Freedom. 
This wonderful addition to these hal-
lowed Halls will be dedicated to his 
late mother, Gilbertha Otelia Alston, a 
fitting tribute to the person who 
helped cultivate his great talent at an 
early age. 
We are proud that Littleton; his wife, 
Anne; and his children, Sarah, Taylor, 
and Daniel, call Omaha, Nebraska, 
home. 
I salute and thank Littleton for his 
impression upon the community, which 
will be felt for years to come.

PRAYER 
Reverend Dr. Cheryl Coleman Hall, 
Nineteenth 
Street 
Baptist 
Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
God of infinite wisdom, of faithful-
ness, of mercy, of justice and love, we 
gather in this place at this hour by 
grace, and we are grateful. 
We pray for clarity of mind for the 
work of service that must be accom-
plished by each one here. We pray that 
they will use today wisely, for today 
will become yesterday, and today is 
creating tomorrow. 
We pray that broken places are made 
straight and the bridges we are build-
ing are strong and mighty, for we all 
must walk upon them. 
We pray for the persons who support 
them, the family members, support 
staff, the unnamed and unknown as 
they carry out the awesome respon-
sibilities of being their brothers and 
sisters, communities, and country’s 
keepers. 
As we gather, charged with the awe-
some responsibilities for which we have 
been called, we are reminded of all that 
is divine, all that is good, all that is 
merciful in each of us. And we pray 
that each of us is able to unabashedly 
declare at the end of the day, with sin-
cere hearts: May the works I have done 
speak for me. 
In the name of the One who reveals 
truth, the One who is the light that is 
showing in the darkness that cannot be 
extinguished, we offer this prayer. 
Amen.

NEW YORK WILL NEVER FORGET 
FLIGHT 
3407 
AND 
NEITHER 
SHOULD CONGRESS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, this week marks the 11th an-
niversary of the tragic crash of Conti-
nental flight 3407. 
On February 12, 2009, flight 3407 
crashed in Clarence Center, New York, 
killing all passengers and crew mem-
bers on board and one person on the 
ground. The National Transportation 
Safety Board determined that the 
crash was due to pilot error and inexpe-
rience. 
Thanks to tireless advocacy of the 
families of flight 3407 who lost loved 
ones in the crash, reforms like 1500 
hours of flight training for first officers 
have been enacted. However, more than 
a decade later, we still anxiously await 
implementation of the pilot records 
database to allow airlines to access 
records of pilots applying for jobs. 
Madam Speaker, western New York 
will never forget flight 3407 and neither 
should Congress. I urge my colleagues 
to continue to strive for One Level of 
Safety and remain vigilant about avia-
tion and safety standards.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
BILLIE SUE HOGGARD 
(Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the life of 
my close friend Billie Sue Hoggard, 
who passed away on Sunday evening. 
Billie Sue was a lifelong public serv-
ant, a political pioneer, and a devout 
follower of Jesus. She was a nationally 
board-certified teacher. 
Countless students in my hometown 
of Jonesboro, Arkansas, across five 
decades and four schools, were blessed 
to find themselves in her classroom. 
She was selected for three inter-
national teaching exchanges in China, 
Japan, and Mexico. Her passion for 
teaching could not be extinguished, 
coming out of a well-deserved retire-
ment just a few years ago to go back 
into the classroom.

appointed by Governor Mike Huckabee 
as justice of the peace on the Craighead 
County Quorum Court and as the com-
missioner

cational Television Network. 
Under

flipped all legislative seats and well 
over half of countywide offices. In 2017, 
she was awarded the ‘‘Hi, I’m Frank 
White’’ Award, the highest distinction 
given by the Arkansas GOP. 
Billie Sue is survived by her four 
children and seven grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask Congress to 
join me in offering condolences to her 
family and commemorating the life 
and achievements of an incredible lead-
er and servant. 
God bless Billie Sue Hoggard’s mem-
ory.

Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam

asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, congratulations to 
Charles Waites McCabe, a freshman at 
A.C. Flora High School in Columbia, 
son of John and Amanda McCabe. 
Next Sunday, Charles will receive the 
extraordinary award of Eagle Scout 
from Troop 10 at Eastminster Pres-
byterian Church. He is preceded by his 
brother, John Franklin McCabe, Jr.; 
and his first cousins, Michael Joseph 
Harty III, Daniel McCabe Harty, and 
Christopher Robert McCabe; as well as 
his uncle, Robert Ainsley McCabe, Jr., 
in earning this prestigious honor with 
the Boy Scouts of America. 
Charles has also been elected senior 
patrol leader in Troop 10, serving with 
Scoutmaster Flynn Bowie, as well as 
being elected to the Order of the 
Arrow. 
As the father of four sons who are 
Eagle Scouts, I am grateful to attend 
courts of honor such as for Charles. 
This weekend, it was inspiring to be 
with Andrew Talkish at St. Simon and 
St. Jude Episcopal Church in Irmo. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism, led 
by President Donald Trump.

A SIMPLE, YET PROFOUND ACT 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, 60 years 
ago this month, four African American 
students from North Carolina A&T per-
formed a simple, yet profound act. 
They sat at Woolworth’s lunch counter 
in front of a detestable ‘‘Whites Only’’ 
sign. They were called rabble-rousers, 
troublemakers, and worse. They did 
not yield. 
In the days that followed, more stu-
dents joined them, including my friend, 
Clarence Henderson. By continuing to 
sit, they were actually standing up for 
their God-given constitutional rights 
as Americans. 
They may not have known it at the 
time, but their act of courage lit a fire 
of freedom that spread across our coun-
try, all the way to the steps of the Lin-
coln Memorial where Martin Luther 
King, Jr., spoke to us about his dream 
of a more just tomorrow. 
Madam Speaker, this Black History 
Month, we remember the brave sac-
rifices that were made by so many so 
that each and every American would 
never again be judged, as Dr. King said, 
by the color of our skin but, instead, 
‘‘by the content of their character.’’

CONGRATULATING 
BUTLER 
COM-
MUNITY COLLEGE ON THEIR RE-
CENT ACHIEVEMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate the Butler County Commu-
nity College on their recent achieve-
ment. The college was recognized as 
the number one community college in 
Pennsylvania. 
This is quite an achievement, but 
Butler County Community College is 
no stranger to success. For the fifth 
time since 2015, BCCC has been recog-
nized as the best of the best in the 
Commonwealth. This annual accolade, 
presented 
by 
BestColleges.com, 
as-
sesses academic quality, affordability, 
and online competency to determine 
who provides the best overall experi-
ence for students. 
Butler County Community College is 
setting learners of all ages and back-
grounds up for success by providing an 
affordable education that readies stu-
dents for a 21st century workforce. 
Thanks to this model, BCCC students 
are graduating with more opportuni-
ties and less debt. 
I am proud of the educational excel-
lence that Butler County Community 
College has to offer for students in 
Pennsylvania’s 15th Congressional Dis-
trict and the surrounding area, and 
they are certainly well deserving of 
this recognition.

REPEAL THE ABORTION MANDATE 
OR 
RISK 
LOSING 
IMPORTANT 
FEDERAL FUNDS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, last 
month, Health and Human Services 
issued a notice of violation to my home 
State of California that is in direct vio-
lation of the Weldon amendment, by 
requiring all health insurers to cover 
abortions in their plans. 
Governor Newsom has 11 days left to 
comply with Federal law by repealing 
the abortion mandate or risk losing 
important Federal funds. 
In the shadow of the 47th anniversary 
of Rowe v. Wade, it is important that 
we buck the status quo that increas-
ingly takes human life for granted. 
While Governor Newsom continues to 
blatantly disregard people’s personal 
and religious views, I will continue to 
stand here as part of the fight to make 
sure Americans are never forced to pay 
for other people’s abortions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Governor 
Newsom to quickly repeal California’s 
abortion mandate and get back in line 
with the rule of law.

GREAT NEWS ON THE ECONOMY

Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, great

economy added 225,000 jobs in January, 
and unemployment for Americans is at 
a 50-year low. 
But the booming economy has re-
sulted in worker shortages throughout

Vincent of Lindy’s Seafood in my dis-
trict or for Alan Jones at Manor View 
Farms.

seasonable jobs open than there are

Today, I rise to thank the Trump ad-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, on 
Monday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 844, 
providing for consideration of two 
measures, H.R. 2546, Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness Act, and H.J. Res. 79, 
Removing Deadline for Ratification of 
Equal Rights Amendment. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 2546 under a structured rule, with 
1 hour of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
member of the Committee on Natural 
Resources. It makes in order 12 amend-
ments and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.J. Res. 79 under a closed rule, with 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
and provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule deems as passed H. Res. 842, 
a resolution to clarify that a simple 
majority is needed for passage of H.J. 
Res. 79. 
Finally, the rule provides for stand-
ard district work period instructions 
from February 14 through February 24. 
Madam Speaker, it has been almost 
100 years since the equal rights amend-
ment was first introduced in Congress. 
It has been 45 years since it was passed 
by Congress. In this year, as we cele-
brate the 100th anniversary of women 
winning the right to vote in this coun-
try, it defies logic that we are still in 
a holding pattern when it comes to rec-
ognizing the equal rights of women 
under the United States Constitution. 
Therefore, I am proud to oversee the 
rule for H.J. Res. 79, which will remove 
the questionable deadline for the ratifi-
cation of the equal rights amendment. 
When Alice Paul, Crystal Eastman, 
and other suffragists and women’s 
rights pioneers set out to pass the 
equal rights amendment, they knew 
they had a long and fierce battle ahead 
of them. The first version of the ERA 
was introduced in 1923, and it took al-
most 50 years for both the House and 
the Senate to approve it. When the 
amendment was finally approved in 
1972, the preamble to the amendment 
contained a 7-year deadline for ratifi-
cation. 
Thirty-five of the 38 required States 
ratified the ERA in their State legisla-
tures 
during 
that 
initial 
7-year 
timeline. The ERA had broad bipar-
tisan support from Members of Con-
gress and Presidents Nixon, Carter, and 
Ford but was unable to cross the finish 
line in the brief time allowed. 
Why the ERA did not become a con-
stitutional amendment in the seventies 
is up for debate, but it was in large 
part due to vicious, antifeminist rhet-
oric and actions by conservative activ-
ists who sought to trample on the 
rights of all women to work for an 
equal wage, to control their own repro-
ductive health, and to participate as 
equal members of our society, in the 
name of protecting the traditional val-
ues of a privileged few. 
In the years that followed, courts 
have recognized and protected various 
aspects of women’s equality under the 
law through interpretation of the 14th 
Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. 
But as even Justice Antonin Scalia fa-
mously recognized, nothing in our Con-
stitution, as currently written, forbids 
discrimination on the basis of sex. 
Therefore, final passage and ratifica-
tion of the ERA is critical in guaran-
teeing equal rights to me, to you, to 
my daughter, and to all women and 
girls across this country. We will not 
go back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1025 
February 11, 2020 
The equal rights amendment would 
permanently and explicitly prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of sex. 
Laws change, as do the people inter-
preting them, but we are a Nation gov-
erned by our Constitution. The rights 
given to us through the Constitution 
are inalienable, and the protections 
they provide us with are invaluable. 
We hear from the other side of the 
aisle 
that 
discrimination 
against 
women is already illegal. This argu-
ment might be more persuasive if it 
was not being presented by a party 
that is, if anything, less diverse than it 
was in the 1970s. When a party reflects 
a predominantly White, male, and con-
servative voter base, it is easy to see 
why that party might not understand 
the need for basic additional constitu-
tional protections. 
Women continue to face obstacles to 
full equality, including unequal pay, 
pregnancy discrimination, sexual and 
domestic 
violence, 
and 
inadequate 
healthcare access. One in three women 
experience sexual violence in their life-
times; one in five women are sexually 
assaulted on college campuses; and 56 
percent of girls in grades 7 through 12 
are sexually harassed in any given 
school year. Moreover, 60 to 70 percent 
of women face sexual harassment dur-
ing their careers, with Black and 
Brown women disproportionately im-
pacted. 
Women are paid less than their male 
counterparts for equal work. Women 
are treated differently in job inter-
views and can be determined a burden 
for a company if they are pregnant or 
planning on becoming pregnant. These 
indiscretions 
are 
only 
compounded 
when we look at women of color and 
women with disabilities. 
Women in general in this country 
make 80 cents to a man’s dollar. 
Women with disabilities make about 65 
cents to a man’s dollar and 7 cents less 
than a man with disabilities. Black 
women make about 63 cents on a White 
man’s dollar; Native women make 
about 57 cents; and Hispanic women 
make approximately 54 cents on a 
White man’s dollar. The wages for 
trans women fall by nearly one-third 
after transitioning. 
A woman who works full-time year- 
round typically loses $430,480 in a 40- 
year work-life period. That means this 
woman would have to work nearly 11 
years longer to make up this lifetime 
wage gap. 
This also has a serious financial im-
pact on retirement. The average Social 
Security benefit for women 65 and 
older is about $13,867 per year, com-
pared to $18,039 for men of the same 
age. 
So, I ask my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle: If paying women less 
than men is already illegal, if treating 
women differently in the workplace 
and other professional settings is al-
ready prohibited by existing law, why 
does it still happen? 
The answer is simple: because it is 
relatively easy to navigate around ex-
isting laws to protect women. It is easy 
to treat women differently in a way 
that is legal and in line with the law. 
That is unacceptable, and that is why 
we need the equal rights amendment. 
When women earn less for equal 
work, families earn less for equal work. 
If you choose to deliberately short-
change the American family and deny 
them financial security, then, clearly, 
we have different values. 
Although the ERA was passed with 
bipartisan support, and strong support 
from Republican women, we saw in the 
Rules Committee last night and in de-
bate about this rule and bill that the 
spirit of the late Phyllis Schlafly has 
overtaken today’s Republican Party, 
which now seeks to cloak deep-seated 
misogyny in anti-choice rhetoric. 
Passing the equal rights amendment 
is long overdue. I am excited to be part 
of a Democratic majority that will re-
move this arbitrary deadline for ratifi-
cation and finally allow States to exer-
cise their constitutional authority to 
pass this critical and fundamentally 
American amendment. 
This rule will also provide for consid-
eration of H.R. 2546, the Protecting 
America’s Wilderness Act. This is a 
package of public lands bills from the 
Natural Resources Committee that will 
designate more than 1.3 million acres 
as wilderness or potential wilderness 
areas, preserving those public lands for 
generations to come. 
Few things in the United States are 
as universally cherished by Americans 
as public lands. Our country is home to 
more than 111 million acres of des-
ignated wilderness, and these lands 
help us to combat climate change, pro-
vide for an array of ecological diver-
sity, and offer recreational activity to 
Americans, young and old. 
As we continue to endure devastating 
and 
worsening 
effects 
of 
climate 
change, providing for millions of addi-
tional acres of wilderness allows for 
these areas to continue to serve as crit-
ical carbon sinks to capture and miti-
gate carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. 
Additionally, wilderness areas are 
some of our most naturally resilient 
landscapes. This allows them to endure 
periodic wildfires and other disturb-
ances, like floods, with relatively little 
human impact or intervention. This 
helps save the government money, as 
opposed to a more active style of forest 
management.

This legislation not only helps to 
combat climate change, it also sup-
ports access to clean water, protects 
pristine wildlife habitats, and bolsters 
the outdoor recreation economies of 
Colorado, California, Washington, and 
more. 
The Protecting America’s Wilderness 
Act was crafted in direct coordination 
with the stakeholders and local voices 
that it will impact. I thank Chairman 
GRIJALVA, Congresswoman DEGETTE, 
and the members of the Natural Re-
sources Committee for the lengths they 
went to in order to make this bill a 
success and one that will preserve and 
protect pristine wildlife habitats, clean 
water, and access to outdoor rec-
reational opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Representative 
SCANLON
for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Before I get to the points, I know 
that we differ on policy, but I have to 
tell you that I was offended by what I 
thought were racist and sexist com-
ments made by my Democratic col-
league about the Republican party 
makeup, and I totally disagree with 
her. 
Madam Speaker, to begin, I would 
like to clarify what H.J. Res 79 is. It is 
not the equal rights amendment. It is a 
date change. The legislation is a joint 
resolution removing the deadline for 
ratification of the equal rights amend-
ment in States that the amendment 
shall be valid and adopted as part of 
the Constitution whenever ratified by 
the legislatures of three-quarters of the 
States. 
Democrats say this is about equal 
rights for women. Well, I am a woman, 
and so I, obviously, support equal 
rights for women. But I oppose H.J. Res 
79 for the following reasons: 
First: The bill is totally unconstitu-
tional. 
When the ERA originally passed on 
March 22, 1972, Congress explicitly set a 
deadline for ratification stating that 
the amendment shall be valid when 
ratified by the legislatures of three- 
fourths of the several States within 7 
years from the date of its submission 
by the Congress. That meant that the 
final deadline was March 22, 1979, al-
most 41 years ago. 
By the end of this initial deadline, 
only 35 of the 38 States needed had 
ratified it, so Congress with a simple 
majority vote, which is questionable, 
extended the deadline once to 1982, but 
no other States joined in ratification. 
Thus, the equal rights amendment was 
dead. 
It is also imperative to note that five 
of the 35 States rescinded their ratifi-
cations. So then the count was down to 
only 30 States. 
In fact, the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice issued a legal opinion just last 
month reiterating that the ERA ratifi-
cation timeline is expired. 
Ultimately, when the 1972 ERA’s 
deadline passed without ratification by 
three-fourths of the States, the pro-
posed amendment expired and is, there-
fore, no longer pending. The 1972 ERA, 
therefore, can no longer be ratified be-
cause it no longer exists. 
In one of its works, the nonpartisan 
Congressional Research Service, which 
we all turn to, states that the ERA for-
mally died on June 30, 1982. The U.S. 
Supreme Court also dismissed all cases 
related to the ERA because it held the 
cases to be moot, saying that the ERA 
ratification date had expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1026 
February 11, 2020 
Regardless of one’s view on whether 
or not the equal rights amendment 
should be adopted, the fact remains 
that the equal rights amendment was 
not ratified by the necessary 38 States 
by the deadline set forth in the text of 
the amendment itself. 
Just last night, Supreme Court Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, certainly 
not known as a conservative, said Vir-
ginia’s recent adoption of an ERA reso-
lution was long after the deadline 
passed. She went on to say, ‘‘I would 
like to see a new beginning. I’d like it 
to start over. There’s too much con-
troversy about latecomers. Virginia— 
long after the deadline passed. Plus, a 
number of States have withdrawn their 
ratification.’’ Remember the five I 
talked about. ‘‘So if you count a late-
comer on the plus side, how can you 
disregard 
States 
that 
said 
we’ve 
changed our minds?’’ And deratified. 
In addition, the Democrats’ sneaky 
act to slip into this resolution lan-
guage that would deem that a mere 
majority vote instead of the two-thirds 
vote needed on a constitutional amend-
ment, has significant constitutional 
and legal ramifications. 
Should my Democratic colleagues 
wish to proceed with seeking to add the 
ERA to the Constitution, the appro-
priate method would be to follow the 
procedure outlined in the Constitution: 
Passage by a two-thirds majority in 
both Houses of Congress, followed by 
ratification by three-quarters of the 
States. And it seems as recently as last 
night, Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg 
agrees. 
Secondly: The ERA amendment is 
not necessary. 
Women’s equality of rights under the 
law is already recognized in our Con-
stitution in the Fifth and 14th Amend-
ments. 
Women do deserve fairness and equal-
ity under the law. Through established 
law such as Title IX, the Equality Op-
portunity Act of 1963, Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission, Preg-
nancy Discrimination Act, and Equal 
Pay Act, plus State and local laws, 
women have made huge strides against 
institutional 
discrimination 
against 
women 
in 
education, 
employment, 
sports, politics, and many other as-
pects of society. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has consist-
ently ruled that both the equal protec-
tion clause of the 14th Amendment and 
the due process clause of the Fifth 
Amendment guarantee women equal 
protection under the law. 
That is why the ACLU women’s 
rights director Lenora Lapidus wrote 
in response to what Ms. SCANLON 
brought up about Justice Scalia, ‘‘it 
has been clearly understood that the 
14th Amendment prohibits discrimina-
tion based on sex. In decision after de-
cision, many authored by conservative 
Supreme Court Justices, this principle 
has been reaffirmed.’’ 
Third: If ratified, the ERA would be 
used by pro-abortion groups to undo 
pro-life legislation and lead to more 
abortions and taxpayer funding of 
abortions. 
Don’t take my word for it. Let’s look 
at what pro-abortion groups have done 
and what they are saying now. 
Abortion activists have already uti-
lized State-level ERAs to require tax-
payer-funded abortion. 
In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme 
Court ruled unanimously that the 
State ERA required the State to fund 
abortions since procedures sought by 
men like, prostate surgery, are funded. 
A lawsuit in Connecticut used similar 
arguments and achieved the same ob-
jective, full taxpayer-funded abortion. 
In 2019, Planned Parenthood and 
Women’s Law Center filed a lawsuit in 
Pennsylvania arguing that the Penn-
sylvania’s ERA means abortion must 
be included in medical coverage for 
women because men aren’t denied cov-
erage for anything. 
In another example, NARAL Pro- 
Choice America—which is a pro-abor-
tion group—in a March 13, 2019, na-
tional alert asserted that the ERA 
would 
reinforce 
the 
constitutional 
right to abortion. It would require 
judges to strike down anti-abortion 
laws. 
Further, in a 2019 letter to the House 
Judiciary Committee, the ACLU stat-
ed, ‘‘The equal rights amendment could 
provide an additional layer of protec-
tion against restrictions on abortion, 
contraception, and other forms of re-
productive healthcare.’’ 
And the pro-ERA website itself, 
EqualRightsAmendment.org, explicitly 
states that ratifying the ERA into the 
U.S. Constitution would ‘‘provide a 
strong legal defense against a rollback 
of women’s rights, including but not 
limited to Roe v. Wade.’’ 
In conclusion, H.J. Res 79 is unconsti-
tutional. The ERA is unnecessary since 
constitutional, Federal, State and local 
laws already guarantee equal protec-
tions, and the ERA, if ratified, would 
be used by pro-abortion groups to undo 
pro-life laws. 
Also included in this rule is H.R. 2546, 
the Protecting America’s Wilderness 
Act. 
My Republican colleagues on the 
Natural Resources Committee have ex-
pressed concern that each of the bills 
in this package will remove large 
swaths of land in rural areas from de-
velopment, threaten the economic base 
of these regions, and reduce the effec-
tiveness of fire prevention plans. 
My Democratic colleagues on the 
Natural Resources Committee have 
continued the disappointing trend of 
moving bills that are not supported by 
the Members who represent the im-
pacted lands. In fact, all the wilderness 
designations in H.R. 2546 are located 
outside the bill sponsor’s district. In-
stead, most are located in Representa-
tive SCOTT TIPTON from Colorado’s dis-
trict, who opposes the bill. 
One of the greatest concerns about 
this piece of legislation is that signifi-
cant opposition from local counties, 
communities, and stakeholder groups 
seem to go ignored. The consensus is 
that these bills will negatively impact 
individual 
homeowners, 
agricultural 
entities, water providers, first respond-
ers, and the recreation tourism indus-
try. 
Today, it seems what we simply have 
before us are examples of: 
Legislating in other Members’ dis-
tricts without their support or any at-
tempt to collaborate. 
Increased risk of wildfires due to the 
lack of management and inability to 
use mechanical means to fight or pre-
vent fire within all newly designated 
wilderness areas. 
Lack of support from local leaders 
and stakeholders across each of the 
bills in this legislation. 
Concerns about threats to private 
property rights when the vast majority 
of land proposed to be added to the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Rec-
reational Area is nonFederal. 
I urge opposition to the rule, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, cer-
tainly we see a laundry list of reasons 
for opposition to this bill. 
We hear that it is unconstitutional. 
Although, in fact, nothing in the Con-
stitution speaks to deadlines that Con-
gress may set. 
We usually hear our colleagues from 
across the aisle invoking Justice Gins-
burg to argue that for some reason we 
should start over with this century- 
long process. 
Justice Ginsburg has obviously been 
a champion on these issues, and to the 
extent that remarks that she has made 
are being quoted, I understand that 
they were expressing a personal view 
about the ideal circumstances in which 
the ERA could pass, not a legal view 
about what is required. 
It is probably better to remember 
that Justice Ginsburg has been a cham-
pion for the ERA since it was approved 
by both Houses of Congress in a bipar-
tisan way in the 1970s. And as she reit-
erated just yesterday, ‘‘The union will 
be more perfect when that simple 
statement—that men and women are 
persons of equal citizenship stature—is 
part of our fundamental instrument of 
government.’’ 
Please note, this is a tactic of dis-
tracting and dividing. Last night I 
asked our colleague if he would be will-
ing to vote for the ERA if, in fact, we 
were to start over, which he said he 
would not. And we certainly do not see 
members of the Republican party say-
ing that they would vote for the ERA if 
it would be reintroduced. 
What we are seeing here is simply an 
effort to quash the ERA, to end it, to 
put it to rest, to not have it be made 
part of our Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. DELBENE). 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in order to form a more 
perfect union, and I do that by sup-
porting today’s rule and the underlying

February 11, 2020 
resolution which will finally allow for 
the 28th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion, the equal rights amendment. 
The equal rights amendment will en-
shrine the fundamental principle that 
every 
American 
be 
afforded 
equal 
rights under the law, including women. 
In 1971 and 1972, Congress overwhelm-
ingly passed the equal rights amend-
ment. And just a few weeks ago Vir-
ginia became the 38th State to ratify it 
and the last State needed to amend our 
Constitution. 
b 1245 
H.J. Res. 79 would remove the dead-
line for States to ratify the equal 
rights amendment, clearing the path 
for full equality of rights for women. 
Because women are still subject to 
significant pay disparities and sexual 
harassment, our work is far from over. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support today’s rule and the 
underlying resolution and join me in 
voting for a more perfect union. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER), my good 
friend. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to op-
pose H.J. Res. 79. This resolution seeks 
to unconstitutionally remove the dead-
line for ratification of the equal rights 
amendment. 
In 1972, Madam Speaker, when I was 
10 years old, Congress originally set 
the deadline for ratification at 7 years 
by two-thirds vote. Before the original 
time period expired, Congress then 
passed a 3-year extension, which also 
passed before the necessary number of 
States ratified the amendment. 
Today, 37 years after the constitu-
tional time has expired, it is quite 
clear that, because of a new focus on a 
so-called 
right 
to 
taxpayer-funded 
abortion, the equal rights amendment 
does not have support from a two- 
thirds majority of Congress or, likely, 
from two-thirds of the States, cer-
tainly, as we have seen at least five 
States have already rescinded. 
Instead of following the guidance of 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsberg and starting the amendment 
process over again as the Founders in-
tended—and this is, let me just say, 
Madam Speaker, Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsberg’s legal view as a member of 
the U.S. Supreme Court. It is her legal 
view. It is her constitutional view. In-
stead, 
Democrats 
are 
attempting, 
today, to retroactively and unconsti-
tutionally remove this deadline by a 
simple majority vote. 
For decades, Congress has expressed 
the will of the American people and not 
used taxpayer dollars for abortion. 
Whether they were Democrat or Repub-
lican Presidents, split Chambers of 
Congress or one party in control of 
both branches of government, there has 
been bipartisan agreement on appro-
priations language to limit taxpayer- 
funded abortions and support basic pro- 
life protections across our country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Missouri. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, if 
the Democrat majority wants to test 
that bipartisan agreement and upend 
decades of precedent, they are welcome 
to use the simple, clear process laid out 
in Article V of the Constitution to pro-
pose and adopt a new and legal ERA 
amendment. 
Let me be clear, Madam Speaker. I 
support equal rights for women, as does 
the U.S. Constitution, but skirting 
that process for partisan gain sets a 
dangerous and un-American precedent. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to protect our democracy and 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I include in the RECORD a January 15 
New York Times article, entitled: 
‘‘Why the Equal Rights Amendment is 
Back.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 15, 2020] 
WHY THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IS BACK 
(By Patrick J. Lyons, Maggie Astor and 
Maya Salam) 
Of all the laws the Virginia legislature 
may pass now that Democrats have won con-
trol of it, none have been so long in the mak-
ing as the Equal Rights Amendment. First 
proposed almost a century ago and passed by 
Congress in 1972, the E.R.A., which would add 
a provision to the Constitution guaranteeing 
equal rights to men and women, could have 
sweeping implications if it takes effect. 
Both houses of the Virginia Legislature ap-
proved 
the 
ratification 
resolution 
on 
Wednesday. Supporters hope that will lift 
the amendment over the threshold to become 
part of the federal Constitution. But there is 
considerable dispute over whether the state’s 
action will have any legal effect or merely be 
symbolic. 
Here’s what it is all about. 
What does the amendment say? 
The E.R.A. is three sentences long, and the 
key one is the first: ‘‘Equality of rights 
under the law shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State on ac-
count of sex.’’ The other two are about put-
ting it into effect. 
By some estimates, 80 percent of Ameri-
cans mistakenly believe that women and 
men are already explicitly guaranteed equal 
rights by the Constitution. But it currently 
does so only for the right to vote. The 
amendment is intended to remedy that omis-
sion. 
Supporters say adopting the E.R.A. would, 
among other things, sweep away discrimina-
tion in the workplace; help women to 
achieve pay equality and allow men to get 
paid paternity leave; require states to inter-
vene in cases of domestic violence and sexual 
harassment; and guard against discrimina-
tion based on pregnancy and motherhood. It 
may 
bolster 
protections 
for 
gay 
and 
transgender people as well. 
Opponents have argued that the amend-
ment would, among other things, undermine 
family structure; intrude on religious prac-
tice; and lead to the outlawing of separate 
men’s and women’s bathrooms, single-sex 
college dormitories and other accommoda-
tions. Some also argue that the E.R.A. is un-
necessary because the 14th Amendment al-
ready guarantees everyone the ‘‘equal pro-
tection of the laws.’’ The Supreme Court has 
indeed read the 14th Amendment to ban 
many forms of sex discrimination. But sup-
porters of the E.R.A. say there are still gaps 
in existing laws, both at the federal and 
state level, that need to be addressed com-
prehensively. 
How did the amendment stall, and come 
back to life? 
Amendments to the Constitution require 
the assent of three-quarters of the states— 
these days, 38 out of 50—to take effect. When 
Congress passed the amendment in 1972, it 
set a deadline for reaching that goal—origi-
nally 1979, later extended to 1982. But only 35 
states ratified the amendment in time, in 
large part because of an opposition campaign 
led by Phyllis Schlafly, a proudly anti-femi-
nist Republican. 
There the issue lay until 2017, when a 
Democratic state senator in Nevada, Pat 
Spearman, persuaded the Legislature to rat-
ify the amendment, even though the deadline 
had long passed. That move revived interest 
across the country, and Illinois followed suit 
in 2018. An effort in Virginia fell short a year 
ago, but after Democrats won in November, 
they promised to try again. 
Is Virginia’s assent enough to get to 38 
states? 
That’s a bit cloudy. Virginia is the 38th 
state to approve the Equal Rights Amend-
ment, but over the years, five of those 
states—Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, South 
Dakota and Tennessee—have voted to re-
scind their ratifications, and it is possible 
that opponents would challenge the amend-
ment on that basis. 
They would not have precedent on their 
side. After the Civil War, several states tried 
to take back their ratifications of either the 
14th or 15th Amendments, but they were 
counted in the Yes column anyway, and all 
of those states later re-ratified the amend-
ments. 
What about the deadline? 
That is the big question now. It could be 
repealed, or challenged in court, or both. 
Most amendments to the Constitution 
have not had explicit ratification deadlines. 
The most recent one, the 27th, had been 
pending for more than 200 years before it was 
finally ratified in 1992. 
Supporters argue that the deadline for the 
E.R.A. is unenforceable because it is stated 
only in the preamble to the amendment, and 
not in the amendment itself. 
The Supreme Court said in 1921 that 
amendments had to be ratified within a rea-
sonable time after passage, and that Con-
gress had the authority to set a deadline, as 
it has almost always done since then. But in 
1939, the court ruled that the question of 
whether ratification of an amendment was 
timely and valid was ‘‘non-justiciable’’—in 
other words, it was up to Congress, and none 
of the courts’ business. 
Congress extended the deadline for the 
Equal Rights Amendment once—by three 
years—and supporters say it could do so 
again, or repeal the deadline entirely. A bill 
to do that was introduced in the Democratic- 
controlled House in April and attracted 
broad support. It would also have to pass the 
Republican-controlled 
Senate, 
where 
its 
prospects are less clear, though it has spon-
sors there from both parties. 
Legal experts disagree, however, on wheth-
er Congress has the power to remove the 
deadline retroactively, and that issue could 
land in court. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
nearly a century, advocates have tried 
to add a provision to the Constitution 
guaranteeing equal rights to men and

women. By some estimates, 80 percent 
of Americans mistakenly believe that 
women and men are already explicitly 
guaranteed equal rights by our Con-
stitution, but it currently does so only 
for the right to vote. The equal rights 
amendment will help remedy that 
omission. 
It is necessary that Congress con-
sider this amendment to the Constitu-
tion to help women achieve pay equal-
ity, require States to intervene in 
cases of domestic violence and sexual 
harassment, and guard against dis-
crimination based on pregnancy and 
motherhood. 
Contrary to the arguments we are 
hearing today, this is not an abortion 
amendment; this is equal rights for 
women. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I am 
waiting for another speaker, but I will 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, there are a couple 
of things that my colleague from the 
Rules Committee, Ms. SCANLON, said. 
She said something to the effect of 
nothing in the Constitution sets a 
deadline. Well, I have to disagree with 
that. Actually, it is not just me; it is 
the Supreme Court. A 1921 Supreme 
Court decision, Dillon v. Gloss, af-
firmed that: 
Congress has the power to fix the definite 
time limit for ratification of a proposed con-
stitutional amendment under its authority 
to determine the mode of ratification for an 
amendment under Article V of the Constitu-
tion. 
As I said before, this expired back in 
1979. I mean, that is 41 years ago. Then, 
of course, back then, Congress came 
forward, and my understanding is they 
just did a majority vote instead of the 
two-thirds that I believe is needed to 
deal with a constitutional amendment. 
But no other States had ratified. In 
fact, by the 1979 deadline, five States 
had withdrawn their ratification. So 
you were at 35, then it went down to 30, 
and it is dead. 
When my colleague says Justice 
Ginsberg supports the ERA, I know 
that. That is my point. She does sup-
port the ERA. But even she said we 
need to start all over again because the 
deadline has passed. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to make in order a 
resolution to prevent any moratorium 
on the use of hydraulic fracking on 
Federal lands unless authorized by 
Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment would affirm that States 
should maintain primacy for the regu-
lation of hydraulic fracturing and pre-
vent any President from imposing a 
ban on hydraulic fracturing. 
Many of the Democratic candidates 
for President have pledged to ban hy-
draulic fracturing in the United States, 
a campaign promise straight out of the 
‘‘keep it in the ground’’ playbook. 
While this widely used practice is 
often vilified by proponents of the 
Green New Deal, in fact, hydraulic 
fracturing is heavily regulated by the 
States and governed by stringent in-
dustry standards throughout the coun-
try. 
Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, U.S. 
gas bills have fallen by $13 billion col-
lectively every year from 2007 to 2013. 
The U.S. is leading the way in emis-
sions reductions through innovation in 
the energy sector. In 2017, U.S. carbon 
emissions reached the lowest level ever 
since 1992, and per capita emissions 
reached the lowest level since 1950. 
And, very importantly, the U.S. has 
become an energy exporter, and we no 
longer have to rely on OPEC oil like we 
did in the 1970s. Fracking and U.S. en-
ergy independence strengthens our na-
tional security. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG), my good friend. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding, 
and I join the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO) in urging my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question 
so we can consider H. Res. 659. 
Hydraulic fracturing provides enor-
mous benefits to the American people, 
including energy security, national se-
curity, economic growth, and reduced 
carbon emissions. 
The Baaken oil patch, stretching 
across western North Dakota, is an es-
sential contributor to producing 1.5 
million barrels of oil per day and over 
2 billion cubic feet of associated gas 
per day. 
The United States is uniquely situ-
ated in the world economy. We are one 
of the very few if not the only country 
that is both food and energy secure. I 
am proud that North Dakota is a big 
part of that energy security. 
Let us not forget that a mere 10 years 
ago, if Iran would have shot down a 
U.S. drone, seized the British ship in 
the Strait of Hormuz, conducted a ter-
rorist attack on a Saudi oil facility, 
and shot rockets at U.S. troops in Iraq, 
oil would have skyrocketed to over $115 
a barrel and stayed there. 
Do you know what happened the day 
after those attacks? Oil went down 
$1.29. 
Fracking directly employs over 2 
million Americans, including 35,000 
people in my home State. 
In 2020, the U.S. is expected to be-
come a net energy exporter. 
In 2019, we doubled our natural gas 
exports. 
Fracking offsets other carbon energy 
sources, which the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change has noted 
was an important reason for reduction 
in greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. 
With continued technological ad-
vancements like carbon capture stor-
age and utilization, we can continue to 
develop these American energy re-
serves while decreasing carbon emis-
sions. 
Simply put, America is stronger and 
our enemies are weaker because of 
fracking. Any attempt to ban or limit 
fracking makes us less safe and less 
prosperous. 
A fracking ban will do nothing to re-
duce carbon emissions—in fact, it will 
do the opposite—but it will destroy my 
entire State’s economy and send us 
back to the days where we rely on 
OPEC to fuel our economy. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire if the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO) is prepared to close. 
We are prepared to close. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my good friend. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Part of one of the underlying bills, 
H.R. 2546, the Protecting America’s 
Wilderness Act, includes language to 
expand the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area by some 
191,000 acres, an area known as the Rim 
of the Valley Corridor. 
In 2008, Congress directed the Sec-
retary of the Interior to study whether 
to designate all or a portion of the Rim 
of the Valley Corridor as part of the 
Santa 
Monica 
Mountains 
National 
Recreation Area. In 2016, the National 
Park Service recommended an expan-
sion of 173,000 acres. 
The bill today expands the area by 
more than that to 191,000 acres, includ-
ing new areas that were not listed in 
the study. They are completely discon-
nected from the Rim of the Valley Cor-
ridor; yet they are included in the ex-
clusion.

In addition, the National Park Serv-
ice testified in June 2019 against the 
proposed 
expansion 
of 
the 
Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area, citing a need to focus resources 
on the deferred maintenance backlog. 
The proposed land expansion would 
include Soledad Canyon, a mineral-rich 
area where the Bureau of Land Man-
agement has issued contracts to mine 
millions of tons of sand and gravel for 
southern California. Our strong econ-
omy has led to an increase in manufac-
turing and construction. The problem 
is that the supply of construction ma-
terials, like those that can be found in 
this area, is declining. 
This legislation, the underlying legis-
lation, would make it incredibly oner-
ous for contracted companies to move 
forward 
with 
agreed-upon 
projects. 
Democrats often talk about the impor-
tance of a large infrastructure bill, yet 
the passage of this bill would increase 
the costs of essential materials that 
such projects do require.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1029 
February 11, 2020 
The bottom line is that the land 
under consideration is currently in dis-
pute, and decisions that will signifi-
cantly change the landscape and activ-
ity of an area should not occur without 
consensus. 
Last night, the Rules Committee re-
ported a rule that included consider-
ation of two amendments that may 
help address these concerns. Represent-
ative MCCLINTOCK offered an amend-
ment to allow the Secretary of Agri-
culture or Secretary of the Interior to 
exclude from wilderness designations 
any areas that do not meet the defini-
tion of wilderness as defined in the Wil-
derness Act. 
Representative WESTERMAN
offered 
an amendment to strike all designa-
tions of potential wilderness under the 
bill. 
Those 
are 
commonsense 
amend-
ments, and when the appropriate time 
comes, I urge all Members to support 
the amendments. The underlying bill is 
flawed, and I will oppose it on passage. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close if the gentlewoman 
from Arizona is prepared to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to 
urge my Democratic colleagues to halt 
their attempts to change the rules and 
bring back an expired amendment that 
would rewrite our Constitution. Not 
only is this unprecedented, but it is 
wrong, and it is unconstitutional. 
I believe Congress should oppose 
pointless legislation to remove the 
deadline and focus, instead, on uphold-
ing women’s rights, dignity, and oppor-
tunity. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
resolution and work together to pro-
mote 
truly 
helpful 
legislation 
for 
women. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on 
the underlying resolution, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.J. Res. 79 is a 
long-overdue, bedrock civil rights ef-
fort, while the Protecting America’s 
Wilderness Act is an effort that took 
input from a broad coalition of stake-
holders to end up with a bill to posi-
tively impact local communities and 
further our national interest in pre-
venting climate change. 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
duty to uphold and protect the Con-
stitution and the charge of our Found-
ers to continue to form a more perfect 
Union. Passing the equal rights amend-
ment is truly representative of that 
oath to ensure that all Americans are 
treated equally and afforded equal 
rights under the law. 
I would like to recognize some of the 
women in organizations who have got-
ten us to this point: Alice Paul, who 
graduated from college in my district; 
Crystal Eastman; Elizabeth Cady Stan-
ton and Lucretia Mott, who issued the 
first public call for women’s equality 
at Seneca Falls in 1848; the National 
Organization 
for 
Women 
and 
the 
League of Women Voters, which orga-
nized and activated so many Americans 
of both parties in support of this move-
ment; and so many of the other count-
less advocates who have fought tire-
lessly for women’s equality. 
This resolution is for all of them and 
for all the women and girls seeking to 
further advance equality and fighting 
for a more just America. 
This resolution is a bold step forward 
in the ongoing fight for equal rights. I 
recognize that I would not be here 
without the sacrifices made by the 
women who came before me. Their pas-
sion and strength paved the way for me 
and for so many of my colleagues to 
get to where we are today. 
But the battle is not yet won. Let’s 
pass this rule, pass this resolution, and 
show our children that all Americans 
deserve equal rights and protection 
under the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 844 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. That immediately upon adoption of 
this resolution, the House shall resolve into 
the Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union for consideration of the 
resolution (H. Res. 659) affirming that States 
should maintain primacy for the regulation 
of hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural 
gas production on State and private lands 
and that the President should not declare a 
moratorium on the use of hydraulic frac-
turing on Federal lands (including the Outer 
Continental Shelf), State lands, private 
lands, or lands held in trust for an Indian 
Tribe unless such moratorium is authorized 
by an Act of Congress. The first reading of 
the resolution shall be dispensed with. All 
points of order against consideration of the 
resolution are waived. General debate shall 
be confined to the resolution and shall not 
exceed one hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. After general debate the resolution 
shall be considered for amendment under the 
five-minute rule. All points of order against 
provisions in the resolution are waived. 
When the committee rises and reports the 
resolution back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the resolution be adopted, 
the previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the resolution and amendments 
thereto to adoption without intervening mo-
tion. If the Committee of the Whole rises and 
reports that it has come to no resolution on 
the resolution, then on the next legislative 
day the House shall, immediately after the 
third daily order of business under clause 1 
of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of 
the Whole for further consideration of the 
resolution. 
SEC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H. Res. 659. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which a recorded vote or the yeas 
and nays are ordered, or votes objected 
to under clause 6 of rule XX. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

SMITHSONIAN WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MUSEUM ACT 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1980) to establish in the 
Smithsonian Institution a comprehen-
sive women’s history museum, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1980 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smithsonian 
Women’s History Museum Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Since its founding, the United States 
has greatly benefitted from the contribu-
tions of women. 
(2) Historical accounts, monuments, me-
morials, and museums disproportionately 
represent men’s achievements and contribu-
tions and often neglect those of women. For 
example— 
(A) a study of 18 American history text-
books concluded that 10 percent of the mate-
rial documented contributions of women; 
(B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United States 
Capitol’s National Statuary Hall depict 
women; and 
(C) only one of the 44 monuments operated 
by the National Park Service specifically 
honors the achievements of women after the 
2016 designation of the Belmont-Paul Wom-
en’s Equality National Monument. 
(3) There exists no national museum in the 
United States that is devoted to the docu-
mentation 
of 
women’s 
contributions 
throughout the Nation’s history. 
(4) Establishing a comprehensive women’s 
history museum representing a diverse range 
of viewpoints, experience, and backgrounds 
is necessary to more accurately depict the 
history of the United States and would add 
value to the Smithsonian Institution. 
SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF MUSEUM. 
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established 
within the Smithsonian Institution a com-
prehensive women’s history museum, to be 
named by the Board of Regents in consulta-
tion with the council established under sec-
tion 4. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the museum 
established under this section shall be to 
provide for—

yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian 
Women’s History Museum Act. 
H.R. 1980 will establish a comprehen-
sive women’s history museum within 
the Smithsonian Institution. We can-
not tell the story of America without 
telling the story of women in America. 
From the days leading up to our 
founding through today, the United 
States has benefited from the contribu-
tions, accomplishments, and sacrifices 
of women. 
In the 1760s, the Daughters of Liberty 
came together to protest unjust laws 
like the Townshend Acts, helping to 
spark the American Revolution. Soon 
after the Revolution, Abigail Adams 
urged her husband, John, and other 
Members of the First Continental Con-
gress to: ‘‘Remember the ladies.’’ She 
would later become one of President 
Adams’ most influential advisers and 
confidants. 
In the years leading up to the Civil 
War, Harriet Tubman escaped from 
slavery and guided dozens of slaves to 
freedom throughout the Underground 
Railroad, and she didn’t stop there. She 
went on to raise money for newly freed 
slaves and joined other women like 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. 
Anthony in their fight for women’s suf-
frage. 
During World War II, 6.5 million 
women entered the labor force to sup-
port the war effort, including my own 
late mother, who helped build airplanes 
in south San Francisco to fight the 
Nazis. They were exercising new power 
with jobs outside the home, and this 
power has continued to grow over time, 
albeit more slowly than many of us 
would like. 
Later in the 20th century, Rosa 
Parks sparked the Montgomery bus 
boycott, and Sandra Day O’Connor 
took the bench as the first woman ever 
appointed to the Supreme Court. 
More 
recently, 
Speaker 
NANCY 
PELOSI became the first and second fe-
male Speaker of the House. In 2018, a 
record 102 women were elected to the 
House of Representatives. 
However, these and countless other 
accomplishments by women notwith-
standing, historical accounts, monu-
ments, and museums disproportion-
ately represent the achievements of 
men while neglecting those of women. 
Furthermore, studies have shown that 
history textbooks discuss the accom-
plishments of men exponentially more 
often than those of women. This should 
change. 
The contributions and experiences of 
American women deserve celebration 
and recognition, and I can think of few 
better ways to celebrate and recognize 
American women than by establishing 
a women’s history museum at the 
Smithsonian, our country’s preeminent 
museum and research institution. 
The Smithsonian Women’s History 
Museum Act mirrors the highly suc-
cessful National Museum of African 
American History and Culture Act. 
Like that bill, this bill calls for a 50–50 
split between Federal and non-Federal 
funding, a model that worked very well 
for the National Museum of African 
American History and Culture. 
The 
House 
Administration 
Com-
mittee considered this legislation at a 
hearing with Secretary Lonnie Bunch 
in September. During our markup in 
November, we agreed to an amendment 
offered by the minority to ensure di-
versity of political viewpoints in exhib-
its and programs. 
Women have come a long way since 
the Daughters of Liberty began boy-
cotting British goods and organizing 
protests in the 1760s. But despite how 
far we have come, we still have a long 
way to go. I am hopeful that today, a 
century after women were granted the 
right to vote, we will take a critical 
step in creating a museum to recognize 
these achievements and inspire our 
daughters and our daughters’ daugh-
ters to follow in the footsteps of the in-
credible women who came before them 
as we continue our unending work to 
form a more perfect Union. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1980, which would establish a na-
tional women’s history museum within 
the Smithsonian Institution. 
Throughout our history, women have 
made enduring and significant con-
tributions to our Nation’s scientific, 
cultural, economic, artistic, and civic 
life. It is critical to preserve and share 
these stories because women’s history 
is America’s history. 
That is why I, like the 293 bipartisan 
cosponsors of this bill, support a mu-
seum in our Nation’s Capital dedicated 
to showcasing these contributions. 
This bill is the result of much hard 
work. A bipartisan commission exten-
sively studied the complex issues sur-
rounding the establishment of a mu-
seum. Their final report, issued in 2016, 
recommended the creation of a com-
prehensive national women’s history 
museum and that it be part of the 
Smithsonian Institution. H.R. 1980 em-
bodies this recommendation. 
It is critical that the eventual new 
museum reflects the full spectrum of 
views among American women, includ-
ing conservative voices and opinions. 
During committee markup of this bill, 
my colleague MARK WALKER’s amend-
ment to ensure the diversity of polit-
ical viewpoints in the museum’s exhib-
its and programming was unanimously 
adopted. 
The Smithsonian faces a challenging 
task ahead. Creating a new museum

takes an enormous amount of effort 
and resources, with cost estimates ap-
proaching $650 million. 
Further, the Smithsonian has ongo-
ing 
major 
capital 
improvement 
projects, a nearly $1 billion deferred 
maintenance backlog, and storage ca-
pacity issues. 
As I have stated before, I think it is 
imperative that we, as policymakers, 
holistically consider all the multi-
faceted components with these projects 
and how they fit into the long-term 
strategic plan of the Smithsonian. 
These are challenges but should not 
be obstacles to moving forward. With 
strong leadership at the Smithsonian 
and the partnership of Congress, a 
Smithsonian women’s history museum 
can become a reality. I look forward to 
one day visiting it and sharing that ex-
perience with my own daughter. 
Before I yield, I would like to com-
mend my colleague across the aisle, 
Representative MALONEY, and my col-
league standing to my right, the lead 
Republican sponsor, Mr. FITZPATRICK, 
on their dedication to pushing this bill 
through the legislative process. I thank 
both of them and their staffs for their 
hard work to get here. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, we 
are fortunate that the author of this 
bill, the gentlewoman from New York, 
is here with us today. She is someone 
who has been pursuing this idea for our 
country for so many years, and she 
would never give up until we got to 
this day. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY), who has been 
tireless and persistent. We would not 
be here today without the effort of 
Chairwoman MALONEY. 
b 1315 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, ZOE LOFGREN, for her lead-
ership in so many ways and for being 
part of this success today. It would not 
have happened without the gentle-
woman, and I am deeply grateful. 
There is a saying that women hold up 
half the sky. I would say that is an un-
derstatement. Women have made an in-
credible, lasting contribution to our 
country since its founding, yet there is 
not one comprehensive women’s mu-
seum dedicated to women’s achieve-
ments and their contributions to our 
great country anyplace in America. 
We have sliver museums like an arts 
museum or First Ladies museum or an 
Annie Oakley museum or Women of the 
West, but not a comprehensive mu-
seum, which the Smithsonian is plan-
ning with research and the ability to 
have exhibits across the country to tell 
the story of American women. 
Under the leadership of Speaker 
NANCY
PELOSI
and Majority Leader 
STENY HOYER, we will be changing that 
today by voting on H.R. 1980, the 
Smithsonian Women’s History Museum 
Act. 
This is a bipartisan effort. We have 
an overwhelming number of cospon-
sors—293—thanks to the efforts of all 
of my colleagues, including Congress-
man BRIAN FITZPATRICK, who is the 
lead on the other side of the aisle; Con-
gresswoman BRENDA LAWRENCE; Con-
gresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, 
who is chairing a committee meeting 
now; and the Problem Solvers Caucus 
led by JOSH
GOTTHEIMER
and TOM 
REED—bipartisan—Congresswoman 
SUSAN BROOKS; and many, many oth-
ers. 
I am particularly grateful to Con-
gressman FITZPATRICK for reaching out 
to me before this Congress even began 
to tell me he wanted to be a leader—as 
his brother was—on this bill and get it 
across the finish line. 
I also express my appreciation to Mi-
chael Fitzpatrick, BRIAN’s brother, who 
supported this bill as a leader for many 
years. He is greatly missed. He was a 
great statesman, and he is part of the 
success with us today. 
The journey of this moment started 
for me with a walk around the Na-
tional Mall. I was looking at all the 
museums, and I saw them dedicated to 
air, space, spies, law enforcement, tex-
tiles, the Postal Service, arts—all en-
riching institutions. 
But I found myself asking: Where are 
the women? 
Where is half the population of this 
country? 
Today, with the passage of H.R. 1980, 
the House is taking a step toward 
changing that. 
Unfortunately, women have been left 
out of the telling of our Nation’s his-
tory. Sadly, if you walk around this 
Capitol, Madam Speaker, and you 
count the over 100 statues, only nine 
are of women. 
If you look at our 2,500 National His-
toric Landmarks across our Nation, 
only 5 percent of our national land-
marks honor women. And studies have 
shown women are underrepresented in 
the textbooks that we use in our public 
schools. 
Getting to this point has been a very 
long road that took from 1998 to 2014 
for Congress to finally pass my bill 
that I worked on for years with then- 
Representative MARSHA BLACKBURN to 
create a congressional commission to 
study the establishment of a women’s 
museum. 
This bipartisan commission was ap-
pointed by Republican and Democratic 
leadership and chaired by Jane Abra-
ham, a Republican, who has become an 
incredible partner in this effort. Eight-
een months later, the commissioners 
submitted a unanimous report that the 
U.S. needs and deserves—and it is long 
past due—a Smithsonian women’s his-
tory museum and set out a vision of 
how to build it. 
We took those recommendations and 
put 
them 
into 
a 
bill, 
with 
the 
Smithsonian’s input, that is before us 
today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, today we will 
pass this important bill, and I hope the 
Senate will quickly do the same. I am 
grateful for the leadership of Senators 
COLLINS and FEINSTEIN who are leading 
this effort in the Senate. 
My response to those who ask why 
this museum is so important is, if we 
do not even recognize women, how can 
we empower them? 
We need the efforts and the ability to 
excel, but from all of our residents, 
male and female, to win in a competi-
tive world. That is why this bill should 
be supported by every Member of this 
House and, hopefully, the Senate. 
This is not about politics, it is not 
about partisanship, and it is not a 
Democrat or a Republican issue. It is 
an American issue recognizing the con-
tributions of our mothers, our sisters, 
and our daughters. This is about giving 
all women our rightful place in history. 
Madam Speaker, I thank ZOE LOF-
GREN so much, and I urge a strong, 
strong vote in support of this bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, again, I thank my col-
league, Mrs. MALONEY, for making this 
bill a reality in partnership with my 
good friend, as I mentioned in my open-
ing statements, Mr. FITZPATRICK. 
This is the epitome of bipartisanship 
here on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Levittown, Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK), who left 
his favorite job out in the world as a 
special agent fighting corruption at the 
FBI. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member DAVIS for 
yielding, and I thank Chairwoman 
MALONEY for her leadership, her part-
nership, her friendship, and passion 
that she has shown to get us here 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
proudly support the Smithsonian Wom-
en’s History Museum Act. I was proud 
to join the chairwoman in introducing 
this legislation last year. I am even 
happier to be here today to support it 
on the floor. 
Madam Speaker, women’s contribu-
tions to the development of our Nation 
are immense, however, only 5 percent 
of the approximately 2,400 national 
monuments honor women, and as the 
first museum in the United States 
dedicated to the full story of women’s 
history, this museum will tell the di-
verse story of the women who helped 
shape the United States of America. 
H.R. 1980 will finally establish a com-
prehensive women’s history museum in 
the Smithsonian Institution. The mu-
seum will honor and document wom-
en’s contributions to United States his-
tory and exhibit diverse perspectives 
across our history. For too long the 
contributions of women and the con-
tributions that they have made to our

Nation 
have 
been 
overlooked 
and 
underappreciated. This is unaccept-
able. Women have been making con-
tributions to America since our found-
ing, and it is time that they get the 
recognition they deserve. 
This bipartisan bill sends a message 
loud and clear that women deserve an 
entire museum to show the important 
role that they have played in building 
the greatest Nation on Earth. It is 
time for Congress to authorize the cre-
ation of this national museum, and I 
am proud to stand with Chairwoman 
MALONEY and all my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, as the saying goes, 
if you can see it, you can be it. Let’s 
show women across America, young 
and old, the contributions that they 
and their predecessors have made to 
the United States of America can be 
theirs as well. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman MALONEY 
so much for engaging our bipartisan 
Problem Solvers Caucus to be very in-
strumental in getting us here today. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), who is 
a leader for women in Congress and in 
the country. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, it 
is with great excitement today that I 
stand in strong support of the bill to 
establish the women’s museum in the 
Smithsonian chain of museums in our 
country. 
I want to share a story with you, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
When 
I 
walked 
through the doors of the Smithsonian 
African American Museum, someone 
asked me: How do you feel? 
I said, I feel like this country has fi-
nally recognized the contributions and 
who I am in this country. 
We have not been able to make that 
commitment to women. When we all 
walk into museums in this great coun-
try, it is a reflection for the genera-
tions to come of the struggles and the 
accomplishments that different cul-
tures and populations have had on this 
great country. 
I stand here today because of the 
women before me who have struggled 
and fought. I stand on their shoulders. 
I want to be a woman of whom the girls 
behind me will be able to say: Because 
of her, I can be. 
This is a vote for our children, the 
girls who are coming after, and the lit-
tle boys who need to learn and respect 
the history of women in this great 
country. 
I stand in support, and I ask all my 
colleagues to please support this. This 
is a step that we, as women, must not 
let go of. 
I want to recognize my colleague, 
Chairwoman MALONEY, who has never 
given up on this. 
Madam Speaker, as women, we know 
we have to work twice as hard, but we 
get the job done. 
Vote on this museum. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N), who is a fight-
er for her whole territory. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today 
standing in support of H.R. 1980, be-
cause I firmly believe in honoring 
women trailblazers who have shaped 
history and the story of our country, 
women who demonstrate leading by ex-
ample. 
It is just what BRENDA LAWRENCE was 
saying: we need to demonstrate how we 
can achieve that empowerment tool, 
and I think this museum is going to be 
just that. 
Women like our first female Supreme 
Court Justice from Puerto Rico, Sonia 
Sotomayor; our first Supreme Court 
Justice, Sandra Day O’Connor; civil 
rights activist Rosa Parks; astronaut 
and astrophysicist, Sally Ride; the first 
Latina to be elected to Congress, 
former 
Representative 
Ileana 
Ros- 
Lehtinen; 
and 
Representative 
Jeannette Rankin, the first woman 
elected to Congress; are the better ex-
amples. 
Each of them in her respective field 
illustrated the strength and the com-
mitment of women when they set 
themselves a goal. They are just a few 
of the women who transformed the 
American landscape, making it pos-
sible for me to be here today as the 
first female representative of Puerto 
Rico and now the vice-chair of the Con-
gressional Women’s Caucus. 
According to the Census, women are 
50 percent of the total population of 
the country—165 million women in 
America—yet there is not one com-
prehensive museum dedicated to the 
history of women in the United States; 
and of the 2,400 national monuments, 
only 120—just 5 percent—honor women. 
The role of women in the building of 
this Nation was not properly recog-
nized while it was happening. We must 
create a space where that history that 
was not told in their own time can be 
studied, propagated, and given the high 
relief it deserves. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill 
because I think it is time to honor how 
women shaped what is America today. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, speaking of women 
leaders in this institution, it is bitter-
sweet because she is not coming back 
after this year, but I stand here and 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS), who is my 
good friend and my classmate from the 
2012 and 2013 cycle. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to express my 
strong support for H.R. 1980, the Smith-
sonian Women’s History Museum Act. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
MALONEY for championing this impor-
tant legislation. Her determination to 
honor American women, which started 
back in 1998 and the fact that she has 
brought this type of legislation forward 
ever since then is a true testament to 
her grit. 
I also want to thank the chairwoman 
of the House Administration Com-
mittee. I want to thank the ranking 
member of the House Administration 
Committee. I really welcome their 
leadership, and they have seen the im-
portance of this legislation. 
The Smithsonian Institution was es-
tablished in 1846 to increase the diffu-
sion of knowledge, and I can think of 
no better subject matter on which to 
increase and diffuse knowledge today 
in 2020 than educating Americans and 
those who visit our country about the 
amazing American women who have 
come before us. 
A museum dedicated to American 
women’s history will help ensure that 
my daughter and my son—future gen-
erations—understand the impact that 
our women have had on our country’s 
past; and with a greater understanding 
of our country’s past we can better 
navigate the future. 
Establishing this museum to collect, 
study, and establish programs covering 
historical contributions of women will 
inspire 
generations 
of 
women 
to 
come—women like Jeannette Rankin, 
the first woman to ever come to this 
body, the U.S. House, from Montana in 
1916 before women even had the right 
to vote. 
b 1330 
Women like Lucille Ball, and we all 
love Lucy, she was the first woman to 
run a television studio and capture the 
attention of viewers around the globe. 
Women like Dr. Mae Jemison, an en-
gineer and physician, she was the first 
African American woman to travel to 
space. 
Women like these three—and there 
are thousands more—who deserve to 
have their stories shared with folks 
around the world and people here at 
home. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this strong 
bipartisan piece of legislation to create 
this national museum dedicated to 
American women’s history. It will cele-
brate the achievements of American 
women. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentlewoman. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I think it is important to 
note that in this 116th Congress, where 
you had a record-breaking number of 
women come to this body—101 women, 
more than ever before, and hopefully, 
even more will be coming in future 
Congresses—I urge passage of this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. 
WAGNER), my good friend, classmate, a 
leader on women’s issues, and some-
body I knew before we both got elected 
to this institution.

across the river in Illinois. I have the 
great privilege of representing Mis-
souri’s Second Congressional District, 
and he is a leader in this Congress, but 
most of all, he is a wonderful friend 
and colleague. 
Madam Speaker, I also commend my 
good friend, Congresswoman CAROLYN 
MALONEY
from New York. We have 
worked in a bipartisan fashion on so 
many issues, especially when it comes 
to the scourge of human trafficking, vi-
olence against women, taking care of 
the most vulnerable in our society. I 
thank her for her commitment. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian 
Women’s History Museum Act. This 
important bill will honor the immense 
contributions that women have made 
to our country by establishing the first 
national women’s history museum. 
Women from my hometown of St. 
Louis have a proud history of service 
and heroism. During the First World 
War, a brave group of St. Louis women 
volunteered to go to war-torn France 
to start a hospital for injured Allied 
soldiers. They were among the first 
Americans to deploy to Europe and 
some of the very last to leave. When 
they departed for France in May 1917, 
the United States had not even entered 
the war, and many remained in France 
for a year after the armistice. They 
treated more than 60,000 patients be-
fore they returned home to St. Louis. 
Through their courage, ingenuity, de-
termination, and integrity, American 
women have been instrumental in the 
growth of the United States as a global 
force for good. I am so proud that their 
stories will be remembered for the next 
generation of women leaders. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan piece 
of legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I am prepared to close. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, our 
speakers have all been detained at 
markup so I would invite the gen-
tleman to close, and then I will also 
close. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I support this won-
derful piece of legislation. It is talking 
about leadership. You can’t get much 
better leadership than Chairwoman 
MALONEY. This is an issue she has been 
tenacious on. 
It is one I am proud to work with the 
majority party on. At a time when 
America doesn’t think we are a bipar-
tisan institution, I hope today is one of 
those instances where they can turn on 
C–SPAN, or maybe it will get reported 
in the 24-hour news cycle, but we are 
going to come together to do some-
thing that is great, not just for Amer-
ica but America’s history. 
Madam Speaker, since I have some 
time left, we are talking about women, 
strong women who have been a part of 
this institution. She doesn’t know I am 
doing this because she is sitting right 
next to me, but we are going to see the 
retirement of an institution here in 
this House. Come April 1, my House 
Administration minority staff is going 
to lose our institution, our institu-
tional 
knowledge, 
Ms. 
Mary 
Sue 
Englund. 
Mary Sue has worked for government 
for 31 years, 27 years here in the House. 
Working with the likes of Bill Thomas 
makes me look easy, I think. I don’t 
know all the rest of them before I got 
here, but the chairpersons of the com-
mittee before I got here, I know Mary 
Sue, when I met her, she was working 
for then-Chair Candace Miller, and she 
worked for Chairman Gregg Harper. 
For her to stay on and work with us in 
the minority, I am honored. 
It is people like Mary Sue who make 
this institution great. It is people like 
Mary Sue who are going to be missed. 
And it is people like Mary Sue who I 
enjoy embarrassing today because I 
didn’t tell her I was going to do this. 
Madam Speaker, if the folks in the 
gallery would rise today to give Mary 
Sue the sendoff that she deserves. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 7 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Clearly, I will not use that all, but 
you want to talk about empowered 
women? I am joined here in this House 
today by three young ladies who are 
the daughters of somebody I used to 
work with when I was a staffer. 
Ray Fitzgerald died too soon, in 2009. 
Ray, a former staffer, went back home 
to Naperville, Illinois. When his young-
est daughter, Lucy, was 1, he suc-
cumbed to a deadly stomach cancer. 
Those three girls, along with their 
mom, Kristin, are fighting the fight to 
eradicate stomach cancer and working 
with us each and every day. 
I am proud to see that we are going 
to have a museum that is going to rec-
ognize the people like Mary Sue and 
the Fitzgeralds—Kristin, Nora, Maggie, 
and Lucy. 
We have to make sure that we con-
tinue this fight. Even after today’s bi-
partisanship is shown, we have to make 
sure that we stand together in a bipar-
tisan way, because if we don’t, then we 
don’t have the ability to get a brighter 
future for Nora, Maggie, and Lucy Fitz-
gerald, along with their mom, Kristin. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this bill, please, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I will just say a few words here 
in closing. 
First, I again thank CAROLYN MALO-
NEY, who, for the last 22 years, has 
worked to be here on this day. 
I think it took CAROLYN 22 years, a 
female Speaker of the House, 101 
women in the House, and a female 
chair of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration to come together and get 
to this day where I believe we are going 
to finally approve this bill and send it 
over to the Senate. Hopefully, it will be 
such a large vote that the Senate will 
feel a degree of pressure to do the right 
thing. 
Madam Speaker, just a word of cau-
tion on how long it takes after we vote 
to approve this and the Senate, hope-
fully, and the President, hopefully, will 
sign it, if we pass it. 
Secretary Lonnie Bunch is the sec-
retary for the Smithsonian Museum. 
He has done a fabulous job. But one of 
his claims to fame is that he brought 
the National Museum of African Amer-
ican History from an idea to reality. 
He knows how to do this. And he cau-
tioned us that from the moment you 
say go to the moment you open the 
doors to the museum, it is about 10 
years. 
You have to raise the money. You 
have to get the scholars to do the 
scholarship and the exhibition. So un-
less you take that first step, you don’t 
get there. 
That is the advice he gave us last 
September: If you don’t take the first 
step, you never get there. So this is the 
first step, and it is an important one. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say that 
along with the fabulously important 
and famous women who this museum 
will honor, it is also going to go to the 
heart of America, the women who 
maybe weren’t famous but built the 
country, the women like my mother, 
who walked out of their homes and 
built airplanes so the United States 
could win World War II; the women 
who raised their children, who worked 
many jobs, who ran the PTA, who 
helped form the next generation; the 
women who are the beating heart of 
this country will be honored by this 
museum. 
Madam Speaker, you really don’t 
know where you are going unless you 
have some sense of where you came 
from. That is why this museum will 
help all American women and men to 
have a brighter American future. 
I will just say this: We do not fool 
ourselves that having this wonderful 
museum will solve all the problems 
that American women face. We still 
have no family leave policy in this 
country, so women are squeezed be-
tween taking care of their children, 
taking care of aging parents, not hav-
ing an opportunity to get time off from 
work to do the things that life calls 
them to do. We still have pay disparity 
in this country. We still lack constitu-
tional protections under the equal 
rights amendment until we resolve the 
issue on the latest wonderful vote in 
Virginia. All of those things remain. 
But this museum will be a point of 
pride. It will be a touchstone. It will be 
something that every boy and girl in 
America will be able to know about be-
cause it is not going to be just a build-
ing. It is going to be a virtual reality, 
Secretary Bunch has told us, a virtual 
reality throughout the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1035 
February 11, 2020 
Madam Speaker, this is a proud day 
for this institution. We can support 
this bill. We can send it to the Senate 
and look forward to the day when we 
join Congresswoman MALONEY in walk-
ing through the doors of the women’s 
history museum. 
Madam Speaker, I urge that we sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Wom-
en’s History Museum Act. 
On March 31, 1776, future First Lady Abigail 
Adams wrote to her husband, John Adams, 
urging him and the other members of the Con-
tinental Congress to ‘‘remember the ladies’’ 
when fighting for America’s independence 
from Great Britain and drafting a new form of 
government. 
Unfortunately, despite this nation’s great his-
tory, we were slow to take Abigail Adams’ ad-
vice to heart. It took 144 years to grant 
women the right to vote, an historic event I 
talked about a week ago in a floor speech 
commemorating the 100th anniversary of New 
Jersey’s ratification of the 19th Amendment. 
Even this Congress has downplayed the 
contributions of women in history as evi-
denced by the treatment of Portrait Monument, 
the statue in the Capitol of the three greatest 
leaders of the suffrage movement, Susan B. 
Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia 
Mott. 
The Portrait Monument was unveiled with 
great fanfare in 1921 shortly after the ratifica-
tion of the 19th Amendment, but for decades 
it was relegated to an isolated area of the 
Crypt without a plaque explaining the contribu-
tions of the three women or a description of 
the female artist who sculpted it. 
For decades, Congress cited the cost of 
moving the statue as reason enough for keep-
ing it in the Crypt. In the 1990s, the sponsor 
of today’s bill, Congresswoman CAROLYN 
MALONEY of New York, led an effort to raise 
the funds to move the statue upstairs to the 
Rotunda. It was not until 1997 that the statue 
was moved to its current place of honor. 
That date is significant for our purposes 
today. Susan Whiting, the chairman of the 
board for the National Women’s History Mu-
seum organization has stated that ‘‘[The stat-
ue] was the beginning of the entire process of 
eventually building a museum,’’ 
It’s been a long road since 1997 to build a 
Women’s History Museum but passing this bill 
today will be one giant step closer to our goal. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1980, the 
Smithsonian Women’s History Museum Act. 
This legislation will authorize the Smithsonian 
Institution to establish a Women’s History Mu-
seum, which will be located alongside our ex-
isting Smithsonian museums in our nation’s 
capital. 
The contributions by women to the history 
and advancements of the United States are 
historic and consequential. Women have al-
ways served this nation, from nurses in the 
Revolutionary War to the ceaseless quest 
today for equal pay, civil liberties, and equal 
access to health care. 
I am particularly determined to ensure that 
the contributions and perspectives of women 
of color are reflected in this proposed institu-
tion, as our country must demonstrate their 
historic and unquestionable significance. The 
creation of the Smithsonian Women’s History 
Museum will allow all people in this nation and 
the world to better recognize and appreciate 
the significant contributions women have 
made throughout history. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to urge my colleagues to pass the 
Smithsonian Women’s History Museum Act 
unanimously and immediately. 
First, I congratulate my friend and col-
league, Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY, 
on her decades of hard and successful work 
making the case for a women’s museum. 
Women are underrepresented in our na-
tion’s historical accounts, monuments, memo-
rials, and museums. 
Our past, present and as of now, our future 
are all marked by the absence of women’s 
stories. 
From Native American women and early pil-
grims; to Abigail Adams when she wrote to 
her husband to ‘‘remember the ladies’’; to the 
suffrage movement; to the one thousand, one 
hundred, and two Women Airforce Service Pi-
lots that revived our World War II effort; to 
Rosa Parks to Title Nine. 
And I could go on and on and on. 
Clearly, women have transformed the his-
tory of our country. 
But the story of American women is not just 
in the historical moments. It is also the con-
tributions of women in every aspect of our so-
ciety. 
There is a missing contextualization of the 
enormous impact that women have had in 
film, literature, science, government, edu-
cation, culture, sports, and more. 
We have the opportunity to tell the full story, 
so why are we only telling half of our history? 
With these contributions showcased in a 
museum, we will no longer ask—Why don’t we 
have a woman’s National Museum? 
But instead, we will celebrate how fitting it is 
for every girl and every woman to identify with 
our country’s past and want to play a signifi-
cant role in our future. 
You can’t be what you can’t see. 
Frankly, I cannot believe that this museum 
does not already exist. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the pas-
sage of this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LOFGREN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1980, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. LESKO. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

A motion to reconsider was laid on

Stated for: 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, on 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020, I regret not 
being present for one vote session. Had I 
been present, I would have voted in support of 
the Smithsonian Women’s History Museum 
Act, H.R. 1980, rollcall No. 59. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I was 
absent today due to a medical emergency. 
Had I been present, I would have voted: ‘‘yea’’ 
on rollcall No. 57, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 58, and 
‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 59. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
NELSON 
MANDELA’S 
RELEASE FROM PRISON 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of the 30th 
anniversary of the former South Afri-
can President Nelson Mandela’s release 
from jail. 
Mandela worked tirelessly to abolish 
apartheid, empower his fellow citizens, 
and fight the injustices against the dis-
enfranchised people of South Africa. 
Mandela’s efforts led not only to his 
27-year imprisonment and subsequent 
ascent to the presidency, but it also 
transformed the consciousness of a 
generation and precipitated a more 
acute international focus on human 
rights. I hope we are all informed by 
his wise words: ‘‘May your choices re-
flect your hopes, not your fears.’’ 
Here in this Chamber and around the 
world we should all feel indebted to 
him for his service and commitment to 
justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1038 
February 11, 2020 
RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NATIONAL INTEL-
LIGENCE COUNCIL 
(Mr. STEWART asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Chair, I am 
honored today to recognize the 40th an-
niversary of the National Intelligence 
Council. This is an amazing organiza-
tion that has provided invaluable con-
tributions to the security of the United 
States. 
On December 3, 1979, the NIC was cre-
ated to serve as a source of extensive 
expertise on intelligence issues, facili-
tate collaboration, conduct outreach to 
other experts beyond government, and 
to connect intelligence and policy com-
munities through a wide variety of in-
telligence products. 
The work the NIC does is important. 
It really does matter. These products 
include the National Intelligence Esti-
mate, the annual threat assessment in 
the form of Statements for the RECORD, 
the unclassified Global Trends report, 
and including oral remarks that the 
Director of National Intelligence gives 
to us as Members of Congress. 
The NIC’s 18 intelligence officers 
serve as the primary advisers to the in-
telligence leader, and their expertise 
and advice is greatly appreciated and 
greatly respected. 
As a member of the House Intel-
ligence Committee, I am grateful for 
them and for their 40 years of dedicated 
service and protecting the American 
people. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE 120TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF ‘‘LIFT EV’RY VOICE 
AND SING.’’ 
(Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to commemorate 
the 120th anniversary of ‘‘Lift Ev’ry 
Voice and Sing.’’ 
This hymn was first performed this 
week 120 years ago by 500 school chil-
dren at the segregated Stanton School 
in Jacksonville, Florida. 
Today this song is widely known as 
the Black national anthem and is per-
formed at churches, schools, sporting 
events, and meetings around the Na-
tion. 
Brothers James Weldon Johnson and 
John Rosamond Johnson wrote this 
song at their home in the LaVilla com-
munity of Jacksonville in the Fifth 
Congressional District, the district I 
represent. 
It was there that James Weldon 
penned the words that inspired hope, 
strength, and faith. It also reminded us 
to never forget the obstacles of the 
past. 
I am honored to represent the birth-
place of this great song that will live 
on for generations to come. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF ANNE 
COX CHAMBERS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Mrs. Anne Cox Chambers, who 
passed away on January 31 at the age 
of 100. 
Her friends and family remember 
Mrs. Chambers as a wonderful, kind, 
and elegant lady, whose influence 
spanned the globe. 
An influential businesswoman, leg-
endary philanthropist, and dedicated 
public servant, her many talents in-
cluded co-owning the family media 
company, Cox Enterprises, for 33 years, 
and serving as the United States am-
bassador to Belgium. 
Mrs. Chambers was Atlanta’s first fe-
male bank director, as well as the first 
woman to serve as a director of the At-
lanta Chamber of Commerce. Mrs. 
Chambers was also a director of The 
Coca-Cola Company. 
Mrs. 
Chambers 
supported 
many 
causes anonymously, but was espe-
cially dedicated to the arts with her 
contributions to the High Museum of 
Art. 
A force to be reckoned with who 
made Atlanta and the world a better 
place, Mrs. Chambers will be dearly 
missed. Her family and friends are in 
my thoughts and prayers during this 
most difficult time. 
f 
SUPPORTING THE SMITHSONIAN 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MUSEUM 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
there are always special moments in 
this House, particularly when some-
thing draws the support of Members 
from both sides of the aisle. I have been 
supporting this legislation for a long 
time, and that is H.R. 1980, the Smith-
sonian Women’s History Museum Act 
carried by my colleague Representa-
tive CAROLYN MALONEY and so many 
cosponsors who evidenced the impor-
tance of the history of women in this 
Nation. 
This is the 100th year of women’s 
right to vote, and I am reminded of the 
suffragettes who decided to take a 
chance and be courageous and to fight 
against the denial of women’s right to 
vote. 
Early in the 1800s, we know that 
women of color stood up, like So-
journer Truth, and said, ‘‘Ain’t I a 
woman?’’ to demand the right to vote; 
she was a suffragette and an aboli-
tionist fighting for freedom and jus-
tice. 
Now, this particular museum will 
open our eyes to the extensive history 
of women, starting from the Revolu-
tionary War that fought for this coun-
try, stood for this country, and helped 
build this country. 
I am excited about being part of the 
support and history of the Smithsonian 
Women’s History Museum Act. I look 
forward to its doors opening for women 
to be acknowledged and recognized in 
the greatness of this country. 
f 
HONORING 
THE 
SUSQUEHANNA 
COUNTY CAREER & TECHNICAL 
CENTER 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
cently had the pleasure of touring the 
Susquehanna County Career & Tech-
nical Center. 
Located in the heart of Pennsylva-
nia’s natural gas boom, Susquehanna 
County’s CTC is helping to provide low- 
cost education opportunities for in-de-
mand jobs. 
During our tour, we heard stories of 
students graduating in a matter of 
weeks or months to enter the work-
force with little to no student debt 
making significant six-figure annual 
salaries. 
Careers in trucking, the natural gas 
industry, and other blue-collar posi-
tions are highly in demand in Penn-
sylvania’s Twelfth Congressional Dis-
trict. 
It was also great to see Cabot Oil & 
Gas, one of the largest natural gas pro-
ducers in the country, investing in the 
school’s commercial driver’s license 
program to create a pathway from 
learning directly into a career. 
This is another tremendous example 
of the natural gas industry being ter-
rific community partners while paving 
the way for America’s energy independ-
ence. 
With February being Career and 
Technical Education Month, it is im-
portant to remember that we should 
not be forcing our students into a one- 
size-fits-all system, especially when 
programs like those at Susquehanna 
County Career & Technical Center are 
providing a low-cost option for in-de-
mand opportunities. 
f 
COMMEMORATING AN IMPORTANT 
MILESTONE 
IN 
OUR 
NATION’S 
FIGHT 
FOR 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
JUSTICE 
(Mr. RUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate an important 
milestone in our Nation’s fight for en-
vironmental justice. 
On February 11, 1994, President Clin-
ton issued Executive Order 12898, mak-
ing it the Federal Government’s first 
major action on this issue. 
Today, I have introduced a resolution 
to honor Chicago native Mrs. Hazel M. 
Johnson, whose contributions were the 
necessary keys to this order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1039 
February 11, 2020 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Mrs. 
Johnson 
worked as the ‘‘mother of the environ-
mental justice movement’’ to address 
racial injustices and improve environ-
mental protections fundamental to this 
action. 
Therefore, I take pride in introducing 
legislation to celebrate the month of 
April as Hazel M. Johnson Environ-
mental Justice Month.

HONORING JAMES RING 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor U.S. Army veteran 
James Ring. 
After graduating high school, James 
enlisted in the Army and served in 
both Iraq and Afghanistan. He later 
joined the Reserve Forces and, at the 
same time, began a 13-year career as a 
City of Lakeland police officer. 
Now, in addition to serving as CEO 
for his own small business, James is ac-
tive with the Lakeland Chamber, pro-
moting issues important to the small 
business community. 
Very soon, James will be returning 
to Active Duty and deploying again. 
Now, that is commitment. 
People like James make me proud 
not only to be an American, but proud 
of my district. The spirit and the drive 
that propel him to serve our commu-
nity as a small business owner and our 
Nation as a uniformed servicemember 
are unique and invaluable. 
From the bottom of my heart, thank 
you, James. And thank you Ring fam-
ily for your service and your sacrifice. 
I know I speak on behalf of the entire 
district when I say that we are so very 
proud of you. 
f 
WE ARE GETTING THE WORK OF 
THE 
PEOPLE 
DONE 
IN 
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
am here in the House of Representa-
tives. I have had the honor to have 
been elected to this incredible body for, 
now, four terms. But I just want to re-
port to you, Madam Speaker, that we 
have, in fact, passed 275 bipartisan bills 
in the last 12 months in these Cham-
bers. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my Repub-
lican colleagues, my Democratic col-
leagues, and, yes, the one Independent 
colleague who is part of every single 
one of those votes. 
I just want to say, that is the busi-
ness of the House of Representatives. I 
just want to remind you, Madam 
Speaker, that we are serious here, from 
all parties, to make sure that we ad-
here to the needs of the entire Amer-
ican people and, in some cases, to the 
world. 
We have addressed issues such as re-
ducing drug pricing to all Americans. 
We have addressed issues when it 
comes to making sure that children 
have a safe place to go to school. 
We have many issues that we are 
faced with here in the House of Rep-
resentatives, and I am proud to say 
that, although the media says that we 
just can’t get along, and, yes, we dis-
agree at times, but, at the same time, 
we are, in fact, getting the work of the 
people done in the House of Represent-
atives. 
I pray that we see the same go on in 
the Senate and, in addition to that, see 
many of those bills get signed by the 
President of the United States.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF CANNON LODGE 104 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
recognize Cannon Lodge 104, which, on 
February 26, will be celebrating 150 
years as a chartered Masonic lodge. 
Cannon Lodge had its first outreach 
on October 27, 1869, from Henry Can-
non, whom the lodge is named after. On 
February 26, 1870, a Masonic charter 
was granted, and Cannon Lodge 104 
came into existence. 
In January 1960, through the gen-
erosity of Brother Elmer Smith, the 
present location of the lodge was do-
nated and dedicated to his father, Cap-
tain Charles S. Smith. 
In 1995, Sea Isle City Lodge No. 280 
was merged with Cannon; and, in 1999, 
Arbutus Lodge No. 170 of Cape May 
Court House did the very same thing. 
I am a proud member of Cannon 
Lodge 104, and we live by the motto: 
‘‘Making Good Men Better.’’ These men 
around me there have made me a bet-
ter man. We are dedicated to the bet-
terment of ourselves, our community, 
and giving to charity. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
the continued work we will do in the 
community, and I thank them all for 
the work my fellow brothers do. They 
are truly heroes in south Jersey. 
f 
REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE’S 
GEAR TASK FORCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
MCBATH). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman 
from 
Montana 
(Mr. 
GIANFORTE) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to hold this 
Special Order on the Republican Study 
Committee’s GEAR Task Force. 
I thank MIKE JOHNSON, chairman of 
the Republican Study Committee, for 
his leadership to make this task force 
possible. 
We started GEAR, which stands for 
Government 
Efficiency, 
Account-
ability, and Reform, to develop a play-
book of commonsense, nonpartisan so-
lutions for improving our government. 
We came up with more than 100 im-
provements. They are all recorded in 
our report, which is now available, and 
I am excited to yield to my colleagues 
to talk about them here today. 
We will start with my good friend 
from North Dakota, Representative 
KELLY ARMSTRONG, who was a member 
of the task force and really led our ef-
forts to find these areas where we could 
reform. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman JOHNSON and Con-
gressman GIANFORTE for their efforts 
to make our Federal Government more 
efficient and accountable with these 
commonsense reforms. 
The Republican Study Committee’s 
GEAR Task Force report is a solutions- 
based plan to reduce the government’s 
size and inefficiency. 
Anyone who has dealt with the Fed-
eral Government knows the frustration 
that the bureaucratic process can 
bring. Unnecessary government delays 
to infrastructure projects have a par-
ticularly damaging effect on economic 
growth and job creation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Repub-
lican Study Committee for including 
my bill, H.R. 3671, the Federal Permit-
ting Reform and Jobs Act, in the re-
port. This bipartisan bill will stream-
line and modernize the Federal infra-
structure permitting process. 
The Federal Permitting Reform and 
Jobs Act will build on the reforms that 
were included in the Fixing America’s 
Surface Transportation Act of 2015, 
otherwise known as FAST–41. 
My bill would make permanent the 
FAST–41 provisions and enact addi-
tional reforms, such as a 2-year dead-
line for the permitting process. 
FAST–41 ensures coordination among 
several Federal agencies to streamline 
the permitting process for the largest 
infrastructure projects. 
The Federal Permitting Reform and 
Jobs Act would expand these types of 
projects that would qualify for this 
streamlined process: simply put, more 
projects completed in a shorter period 
of time at a reduced cost. 
This is a win for jobs; this is a win for 
infrastructure improvements; this is a 
win for reforming the Federal bureauc-
racy and providing Americans with a 
more efficient and effective govern-
ment. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. ARMSTRONG for his work. 
Permitting is an area where we can 
really make advances to make the 
process more deterministic so we can 
get projects on the ground going. I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
there. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan’s Seventh Dis-
trict, Representative TIM
WALBERG,

February 11, 2020 
and I want to recognize him for his 
work on the Taxpayers Right-to-Know 
effort. I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Chairman JOHNSON, Task Force 
Chairman GIANFORTE, and my col-
leagues at RSC for their leadership on 
this task force and putting together a 
document that has answers if we are 
willing to accept them and move them 
forward. Moving them forward will 
make an impact for the better of this 
country and its taxpayers. 
Making government more efficient 
and accountable to the people is some-
thing we all should be able to rally be-
hind. It shouldn’t be a partisan issue. 
After all, we are a government of, by, 
and for the people. 
We are here today to talk about a se-
ries of commonsense solutions that 
will return power to the folks back 
home. I am proud that one of them is 
my bill, H.R. 3830, the Taxpayers 
Right-to-Know 
Act, 
which 
unani-
mously passed the House last week and 
now is over in the Senate. It is a pretty 
simple bill. 
American taxpayers deserve to know 
where, when, why, and how the govern-
ment is spending their hard-earned dol-
lars, and they deserve to have those 
dollars spent in an efficient, smart 
manner. 
My bipartisan legislation requires 
Federal agencies to supply online ac-
counting of their program activities in 
an easily searchable inventory so that 
Americans can keep tabs on where and 
how their tax dollars are being spent. 
All of the information provided for the 
inventory will be updated regularly to 
provide for a more realtime accounting 
of Federal programs and dollars. 
The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act 
will help cut down on waste, fraud, and 
abuse in the Federal Government by al-
lowing policymakers to better identify 
areas where any programs duplicate 
and put a stop to it. 
Congress needs to do more to lighten 
the load for the next generation. We 
need to streamline efficiencies, in-
crease effectiveness, institute more 
transparency, and provide better ac-
counting across the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the GEAR 
Task Force for highlighting these pro-
posals and working to make our gov-
ernment better serve the people we rep-
resent. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
on this. 
Taxpayers do have a right to know, 
and hopefully as that bill moves to the 
President’s desk, it will actually hap-
pen. 
At this time, I welcome the gen-
tleman from Texas’ 27th Congressional 
District, 
Representative 
MICHAEL 
CLOUD, here today. He was a member of 
the GEAR Task Force and really 
brought a number of ideas to the table, 
and he is here today to reflect on a 
number of those. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for his work and leadership on this 
task force. It has been a worthwhile 
project, to say the least. 
Madam Speaker, with over $23 tril-
lion in national debt and annual defi-
cits at $1 trillion, it is obvious that 
Washington has a spending problem. 
We must do something to rein in this 
problem that we are leaving for our 
children, and we must do it soon. 
Every day, taxpayer dollars are wast-
ed on unnecessary expenses. For exam-
ple, as part of the ‘‘use it or lose it’’ 
last-minute spending sprees of 2018, 
Federal agencies spent over $4 million 
on lobster tails and crabs, $673,000 on 
golf carts, $308,000 on alcohol, and 
$53,000 on china tableware. 
Another example is that, despite the 
efforts to address the issue, the Federal 
Government makes over $800 million in 
payments to people who are no longer 
on this Earth. 
And, finally, right now, there are du-
plicative programs, including 91 Fed-
eral programs that train healthcare 
workers and more than 40 workforce 
development programs. Some of these 
may be good, but consolidating them 
might be a great idea. 
We owe it to the American people to 
do better with their hard-earned tax 
dollars, and we owe it to future genera-
tions not to borrow against their fu-
ture. 
On the Government Efficiency, Ac-
countability, and Reform Task Force, 
our aim is to make Washington take 
real steps toward returning the govern-
ment 
to 
its 
proper 
constitutional 
boundaries. 
The 
recommendations 
compiled 
today are not flashy. They won’t lead 
in the nightly news; they won’t domi-
nate your social media feeds; but they 
are important, and it is incumbent 
upon us to look past the 15-second 
sound bites and get serious about the 
business of governing. 
Here are just a handful of solutions: 
We could sell unused Federal office 
space; 
We can consolidate duplicative pro-
grams and agencies; 
We can identify programs that are 
not working and eliminate them. 
The President’s budget has an entire 
chapter on highlighting our govern-
ment’s wasteful spending and some of 
the efforts his administration is mak-
ing to eliminate it. 
All of America understands that we 
need to balance our budget, but no ad-
ministration, Republican or Democrat, 
can do it without that commitment 
from Congress. 
We are elected and given very spe-
cific authority under the Constitution 
to control how taxpayer dollars are 
spent. We must roll up our sleeves and 
do everything we can to rein in this 
Washington spending machine. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
here in highlighting some of these 
wasteful programs. Clearly, we can do 
better, and I thank him for bringing 
them forward. 
At this time, I will yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona’s Eighth Con-
gressional 
District, 
Representative 
DEBBIE LESKO. She has brought to us 
some of the reforms related to improv-
ing our immigration system, and I look 
forward to her sharing that with us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, my friend, Mr. 
GIANFORTE, for giving me the oppor-
tunity to speak about this bill. 
I am from Arizona, so border security 
has been for years and still is the num-
ber one issue that people in Arizona 
care about. They welcome legal immi-
grants, but they also want to make 
sure that Arizona and our Nation are 
secure and that illegal drug trafficking 
is mitigated. 
We used to see mostly single male 
adults crossing our border, and they 
would evade the Border Patrol officers; 
but, recently, however, thousands and 
thousands of illegal migrants are com-
ing from Central America, and they are 
being coached by the cartels, who 
charge them $5,000 to $8,000 a person. 
They are saying: Let’s go up there and 
turn yourselves in to the Border Patrol 
officers, because there is a loophole, 
and just claim asylum. 
And they know that, once they are 
in, they are in the United States and 
they can stay. 
b 1500 
Instead of running away from Border 
Patrol, they turn themselves in, claim-
ing asylum, so our immigration courts 
are overloaded and legitimate asylum 
claims 
languish 
amidst 
frivolous 
claims. 
This backlog is severe. It is a non-
partisan challenge facing our immigra-
tion courts. A recent report stated that 
backlog cases in immigration courts 
exceeded 1 million claims. 
This backlog has rapidly increased 
over the last decade, and as the back-
log increases, so do wait times. Some-
times, it takes years for these cases to 
proceed through the courts. 
We currently have approximately 400 
immigration judges. That is about 2,500 
cases per judge. This backlog strains 
housing facilities and prevents judges 
from granting asylum to legitimate 
asylum seekers and from swiftly re-
moving 
those 
who 
have 
frivolous 
claims and are abusing the loopholes in 
our laws. 
This is a big national security and 
humanitarian crisis. We need efficiency 
in the Federal Government, especially 
when it comes to immigration. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 3859 to 
help reduce the immigration court 
backlog and help legitimate asylum 
seekers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1041 
February 11, 2020 
This bill provides an additional 100 
immigration judges to reduce the asy-
lum backlog. Adding more judges will 
allow these cases to be adjudicated 
faster and help reduce the backlog. 
I thank the task force chairman, 
GREG GIANFORTE, and the Republican 
Study 
Committee 
chairman, 
MIKE 
JOHNSON, for their hard work to in-
crease efficiency and accountability in 
our government, especially when it 
comes to immigration. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman, especially for 
bringing attention to this issue of im-
migration. It is top of mind for so 
many 
Americans, 
and 
having 
the 
judges necessary to pursue these cases 
to final outcome is so important. 
I yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN), from the 12th Congres-
sional District, a task force member 
who helped bring forward many of the 
ideas that are in this collection of com-
monsense government efficiency ideas 
just published recently. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Montana, the chairman 
of this committee. It was a real privi-
lege to serve on this committee. 
Over the years, the size of the Fed-
eral Government has ballooned. While 
it excels in some ways, like keeping 
our Nation safe, oftentimes, it does not 
serve the American people well, and 
that keeps my constituent services of-
fice very busy back in the district. 
As a small business owner, I know 
how important it is to run effective 
and efficient operations. If you don’t 
serve your customers well, you won’t 
stay in business. But because the Fed-
eral Government is largely unaccount-
able, the only people who suffer from 
government inefficiency are the people 
it is intended to serve: the American 
people. 
For far too long, we have let the ex-
ecutive branch seize authority and em-
power unelected bureaucrats. I am 
proud to serve on the Republican Study 
Committee’s Government Efficiency, 
Accountability, 
and 
Reform 
Task 
Force, whose goal is to develop reforms 
to improve the Federal Government in 
order to better serve American fami-
lies. 
Prior to my service here in Congress, 
I served as the Georgia co-chair for the 
Fix the Debt committee, which was a 
nationwide bipartisan effort to identify 
ways that we could balance our budget. 
Our new report here in the GEAR 
Task Force highlights strategies to 
streamline government practices and 
remove waste, much like the Fix the 
Debt committee identified. 
For example, we all know that Wash-
ington has a spending problem. If 
something isn’t working, many of my 
colleagues would prefer just to throw 
more money at the problem. But when 
has that worked? We need serious gov-
ernment reform. 
In my business, we emphasize the im-
portance of streamlining processes so 
we can maximize every dollar. We have 
a 5-year lookback procedure where we 
look at every dollar we spend to make 
sure that we are using every dollar in 
an efficient manner so that those who 
invest—in this case, the American tax-
payers—get the most bang for their 
buck. 
Also, in our business, we have a bal-
ance 
sheet, 
an 
income 
statement, 
where we can actually run ratios that 
we can compare and see how we are 
doing against our peers. 
I mentioned that to someone on the 
Budget Committee and they said: I 
don’t think we have seen that in the 
Federal Government. 
I come from the business community, 
and I came to Washington because we 
have to get down to business. I have 
identified, again, working on this task 
force, on the Budget Committee, and 
on the RSC, so many areas where, 
frankly, we can be much more efficient 
at spending every dollar. 
Every taxpayer should be treated 
like a shareholder. They should know 
exactly where and how their money is 
being spent. 
That is why I have a big problem 
with the appropriations process here in 
Congress. Yes, we kind of go through 
the motions here on the House floor, 
but we bog down, and it becomes a 
four-corner deal where leadership on 
both sides decides: Okay, these are the 
caps, and this is how we are going to 
spend the money. 
The 
appropriators 
appropriate 
to 
that number, and then we are given a 
1,200-page spending bill 24 hours before 
we have to vote on it. That is ridicu-
lous. 
I have emphasized to my leadership 
that I will not vote on a bill like that 
again, that we should stand right here 
through the appropriations process and 
show the American people every place 
we are spending a dollar. 
The GEAR report lays the ground-
work for this type of reform. Our re-
port highlights specific ways we can 
make government more efficient and 
accountable to the people, including 
improving metrics to better inform de-
cisionmaking, utilizing excess Federal 
office space, leveraging duplicative 
government contracts, consolidating 
data centers, reducing security clear-
ance 
processing 
delays, 
and 
much 
more. 
These solutions are common sense, 
and they should garner bipartisan sup-
port. I encourage my colleagues who 
have not yet read the report to do so. 
We have highlighted over 100 ways we 
can improve government and better 
serve the American people. 
We must change the status quo. That 
is why I came to Washington. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Georgia. I 
particularly appreciate his business ex-
perience here in the House and his par-
ticipation on this task force. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
TIMMONS), from the Fourth Congres-
sional District. He has also been a task 
force member, and his fingerprints are 
on this report. 
Mr. TIMMONS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Montana for 
yielding. 
A decade ago, Congress passed a law 
directing the executive branch to in-
form them within 2 years of how many 
Federal programs existed within the 
Federal Government. We are still wait-
ing for that answer today. 
Since 2010, I think we can all agree 
that the size of the Federal Govern-
ment has grown exponentially and has 
overreached in places it should not. 
This unchecked scope of power and in-
efficient bureaucracy affects every as-
pect of our lives and is a threat to our 
well-being and to the foundation of our 
Republic. 
The 
Government 
Efficiency, 
Ac-
countability, and Reform Task Force, 
or GEAR, of the Republican Study 
Committee has worked over the last 
year on ways to rein in wasteful and 
unnecessary government overreach and 
spending, make the Federal Govern-
ment more transparent and account-
able, and get back to the basics of the 
legislative branch, to be a government 
that works for the American people. 
Today, I would like to speak to the 
reform aspect of the task force. In 
order to promote and advance effi-
ciency within the Federal Government, 
government 
practices 
must 
be 
re-
formed. 
All Americans want a government 
that is efficient and that delivers re-
sults. One of the ways that we can re-
form the Federal Government is to ad-
dress our cybersecurity shortcomings. 
Every day, hackers, criminals, ter-
rorists, and foreign countries seek to 
exploit our cybersecurity systems. Ear-
lier this year, a group of Iranian-affili-
ated hackers infiltrated a U.S. Govern-
ment website, wrote pro-Iranian mes-
sages, and wrote a message about Ira-
nian cyber capabilities. 
The threat landscape is constantly 
changing, and the cybersecurity needs 
are evolving along with it. The govern-
ment must continue to reform and up-
date its cyber practices to best defend 
against adversaries. 
The GAO has made over 3,000 rec-
ommendations since 2010 regarding the 
U.S. Government’s cybersecurity poli-
cies. As of GAO’s last full survey of 
these concerns in 2017, only 448 rec-
ommendations have been implemented. 
This is unacceptable, and it puts our 
Nation at unnecessary risk. 
I am pleased that the Trump admin-
istration has made cybersecurity a pri-
ority, 
recognizing 
that 
protecting 
cyberspace is key to our national secu-
rity and economic ability. Congress 
should utilize its oversight authority 
to support cybersecurity initiatives, 
including 
requiring 
that 
the 
out-
standing GAO recommendations be im-
plemented. 
While I touched briefly on one of the 
many important ways the Federal Gov-
ernment can work toward reform, 
there are many crucial steps that Con-
gress can take to ensure it is con-
tinuing to work for the people and not 
the other way around.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1042 
February 11, 2020 
The work of the GEAR Task Force is 
important, and I hope that every Mem-
ber will take some time to read 
through the report. We all made a 
promise to our constituents to come to 
Washington to work for them and 
prioritize their needs. 
This report is not meant to be Repub-
lican or Democratic. This report is 
something that all Members of Con-
gress, regardless of party, should be 
able to get behind. It is a blueprint for 
good government, the kind of gov-
erning that was intended by our Found-
ing Fathers. 
Let’s work together to make Con-
gress and the Federal Government, as a 
whole, work for the people. We can 
start by enacting necessary reforms to 
make the government more efficient 
and accountable. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from South Caro-
lina for his leadership on the GEAR 
Task Force. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
from the First Congressional District, 
for his thoughts on government effi-
ciency and reform. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Montana (Mr. 
GIANFORTE) for his leadership on this. 
It is really a commonsense issue, 
isn’t it? Government efficiency, ac-
countability, and reform is something 
that all Americans can get behind be-
cause, let’s remember for just a mo-
ment, who pays for all of this? Who 
pays to keep the lights on here, all of 
these buildings in Washington, D.C., all 
of the people working in them, all of 
them out in the districts, all of them 
out there in the forests, what have 
you? It is the American taxpayer. 
What is the American taxpayer faced 
with? Trying to take care of their own 
business, their home, their family, 
their mortgage, car payments, saving 
for college, whatever their priorities 
are, maybe going on a vacation once in 
a while, saving up so they can have a 
week or two off. 
What is it that we are doing with 
their money in Washington, D.C., or 
my home State of California in Sac-
ramento? How are we respecting what 
they earn? How are we respecting that 
by the priorities we are putting on 
spending what they earn? 
And it isn’t a contribution, like 
sometimes it is talked about. I love to 
hear the talk around here: the con-
tributions you make, and the invest-
ments we are going to make. No, tax 
dollars are not voluntary. They are 
taken from you per a formula. 
So, how are we treating them? That 
is an important charge to me. 
This is a big place, and there are a 
lot of Members, and there is a lot of 
government, after 230-plus years of lay-
ers. So getting back to just a little 
more efficiency, I think, tells those 
hardworking folks that there is some-
body in Washington, D.C., like this 
GEAR committee, like these folks, who 
are trying to somehow work toward 
balancing the budget someday. 
The President’s budget that he is 
talking about, he is going to take a lot 
of hits for that right now. At least he 
is putting the concept out there that is 
trying to work toward balance instead 
of deficit spending. We will be con-
sumed one day by the service on the 
debt if interest rates go wild. It will 
eclipse our spending. 
Let me just break it down, in my 
couple of minutes here, on a couple of 
things that I think are important 
about this more locally, more for the 
Western 
States 
that 
myself, 
Mr. 
GIANFORTE, and others share. 
The RSC plan lays out more than 100 
solutions for GEAR reform, including 
modernizing NEPA and the Endangered 
Species Act, especially important in 
my State, as well as the West. 
b 1515 
NEPA is Big Government at its best. 
It has been manipulated into some-
thing that is a monster and that it 
should never have been as far as pro-
tecting the environment. It is often the 
largest hindrance on forest manage-
ment, water management, water stor-
age, and for simple power line clearing 
projects; like are so desperately needed 
in my district since the town of Para-
dise burned a little over a year ago, 
and we are trying to rebuild. There are 
more towns I could name in the dis-
trict that that same catastrophe could 
happen to because of overcrowded for-
ests, and in some cases proximity to 
power lines. 
According to this report, the NEPA 
review can take nearly 6 years on aver-
age to get a NEPA report. 
We 
are 
talking 
about 
forestry, 
Madam Speaker. 
How long does it take to study re-
placing a simple culvert in a Forest 
Service road? 
Why does that even need a study? 
If you built the thing to begin with, 
just replace it. No. We have got to 
study it to death. We have to study and 
get permits to clear trees around power 
lines that might be hazardous, a lean-
ing tree or a dead tree. 
Now, thankfully, we got bipartisan 
legislation, me and Mr. SCHRADER from 
Oregon, to help speed that process up, 
and we are going to work on another 
bill to speed it up even more so we can 
do a simple, basic, commonsense thing 
like that. 
Californians don’t have a lot of time 
to wait for the government to do the 
forest management on its lands and in-
frastructure overhauls needed to pro-
tect them from wildfires and droughts. 
Indeed, when the Pacific Gas & Electric 
Company says that it might be up to 10 
years before we can get out of this 
power shutoff situation that we are 
facing because of other issues that they 
are battling through with green power 
mandates and getting permission to do 
the lines. 
Ten years of power shutoffs for my 
constituents? 
Are you kidding me? 
We need to narrow that down to al-
most nothing, because we can’t have 
another year like that. 
So I applaud the Trump administra-
tion for recently proposing reforms to 
NEPA, but we should not have had to 
wait 40 years for the executive branch 
to act. This executive branch is doing 
so. 
Congress should be in the business of 
addressing inefficiency in government, 
having much more oversight, like 
GEAR, like my colleagues are all work-
ing on here as well, including ending 
the cumulative effects and indirect im-
pact statements required by NEPA. 
The Endangered Species Act also 
poses a unique set of problems to Cali-
fornia, specifically with critical habi-
tat designations. 
Take the valley elderberry longhorn 
beetle. Fish and Wildlife recommended, 
I think about 15 years ago, to finally 
delist that. Here we still are waiting to 
delist that and all the habitat issues 
with elderberry plants that inhibit the 
ability to fix flood control projects and 
to fix levees, because you have to plant 
back 15 to 1 for every elderberry bush 
you might disturb because it is possible 
critical habitat, even if you have never 
seen an elderberry beetle land there. 
The Shasta Dam project would raise 
the dam 18 feet and supply about 650,000 
more acre-feet of water for Califor-
nians, whether it is for agriculture, 
people, habitat or whatever—18 more 
feet. That is a lot of water to an exist-
ing dam. It has been halted due to a 
lawsuit calling for the protection of 
the Shasta salamander. The 3-inch long 
salamander makes its home on the 
banks of Lake Shasta which has been 
designated as a critical habitat. 
Now, when there is a lot of rain com-
ing into Lake Shasta, the fastest the 
lake can rise is about one-quarter inch 
per hour during heavy rain. So all the 
salamander has to do is be able to 
move at one-quarter inch per hour to 
stay ahead of the lake level. 
Where is the sense here? 
Eighteen feet above an already exist-
ing lake which the salamander already 
thinks is pretty cool to live next to. 
Critical habitats unnecessarily delay 
critical infrastructure projects like the 
Shasta Dam, and their designation 
standards need to be reformed for 
whatever habitat is. 
The RSC GEAR report has done an 
excellent job at addressing these nec-
essary changes, including reforms to 
NEPA and the ESA. I sincerely hope 
Congress—both sides of the aisle—will 
take these suggestions and hold bu-
reaucracy more accountable to the 
American people who pay for all this. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for his remarks. 
I agree we have seen the impacts of 
an overly lengthy NEPA process that 
just ties projects in knots, and the 
weaponization of the Endangered Spe-
cies Act has allowed it to drift away 
from its original intent of protecting 
species. So I appreciate the gentle-
man’s leadership on this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1043 
February 11, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the 21st District of Texas 
(Mr. ROY) for his thoughts on govern-
ment efficiency and reform and also his 
leadership on national emergency re-
form. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Montana for his 
leadership on this and my colleagues 
who have been working together on 
this important effort. 
Madam Speaker, things like govern-
ment efficiency, accountability, and 
reform are things you would think we 
would all be able to get behind. I am 
certainly of the belief that the Amer-
ican people who are watching—even if 
it is just a handful in their living 
rooms—are a lot more than are watch-
ing here in the Chamber. 
I am also interested, when you look 
at the C–SPAN cameras, if you pan 
back, nobody is here to talk about 
what I am about to talk about. Yet we 
saw last week a Senate Chamber with 
100 Senators sitting there debating 
what? 
They were debating failed Articles of 
Impeachment. 
Here we are trying to figure out how 
to make our government accountable, 
make it efficient, and make it effec-
tive. Reclaiming power from elected 
bureaucrats, 
reforming 
government 
practices 
to 
curb 
inefficiency 
and 
waste, and reemphasizing and reward-
ing innovation is something I think all 
Americans could get behind. 
But I would like to talk about some-
thing that I think is critically impor-
tant, which is restoring Article I and 
restoring the primacy of this body and 
the Senate in governing our Nation. 
We shouldn’t be looking to the execu-
tive branch, no matter who is in power, 
to be making decisions that should be 
reserved to the Members of this body 
and the Senate. 
Congress ceded some of our power in 
1976 with the passage of the National 
Emergencies Act, which pulled to-
gether a number of different powers 
contained in the 130 different statutes 
at the time giving the President uni-
lateral authority to declare emer-
gencies. 
Madam Speaker, there are currently 
33 emergencies in effect, some of them 
dating back to the Carter administra-
tion. Now, think about that. It is an 
emergency. It is an emergency, and it 
dates back to the Carter administra-
tion. This is no way to govern. 
I learned this how? 
Well, last spring when we were hav-
ing a robust debate about securing the 
border of the United States—by the 
way, a sovereign nation should not 
need to have a debate about ensuring 
that our border is secure when you 
have 900,000 individuals being appre-
hended on our southern border last fis-
cal year alone, 900,000—600,000 of whom 
were caught and released into our 
country. The President of the United 
States is working to secure our border, 
to put up physical barriers, to build a 
wall, and to build a fence which is des-
perately needed. And it is working 
where it is being implemented. 
The President is right to do so. He is 
right that there is an emergency at our 
southern border, and he is right that 
the Members of this body led by Demo-
crats refuse to acknowledge the crisis 
at our southern border. He was right to 
defend our southern border. 
But the question that popped into my 
head is: All right, we have an emer-
gency. Now what? 
This body, Article I, should do its 
job. It is incumbent upon Congress to 
act. We shouldn’t allow an emergency 
to be declared and then operate our 
policies under it, even if I agree with 
the policy, and I do. I do agree with the 
policy of what the President is doing. 
So I implore my Democrat col-
leagues, who are not in the Chamber, 
to come have a debate about restoring 
Article I and about all of the different 
issues that may occur. 
I introduced H.R. 1755 which is the 
companion legislation to that which 
was offered by my friend, Senator MIKE 
LEE of Utah, in the U.S. Senate, and 
that bill would take a President’s 
emergency declaration and terminate 
it after 30 days unless Congress affirm-
atively authorizes an extension. The 
bill would also terminate the emer-
gency declaration after 1 year unless a 
new resolution of approval is enacted. 
It requires the President to report to 
Congress on how the President is exer-
cising emergency powers. 
Senator LEE’s bill has been passed 
out of committee, but we have had 
nary a debate here in the body about 
restoring Article I. We have had a lot 
of speeches and a lot of complaints 
about the President of the United 
States and a lot of complaints about 
what is happening at our border, but 
not one serious debate about restoring 
Article I. 
Let’s do it. Let’s come together right 
now and let’s stand up as a body in 
Congress and say: Do you know what? 
If there is an emergency, great, Mr. 
President, go act in the emergency; but 
30 days later we can agree it is time for 
Congress to decide how money is going 
to be appropriated and how we are 
going to enforce and implement the 
laws that we think are important for 
this body. 
This is critical to government re-
form. This is critical to making sure 
we are making government more effi-
cient and more accountable. This body 
is the body, this House is the people’s 
House and most responsive to the 
American people. 
I would beg, literally, my Democratic 
colleagues to engage in debate, as we 
sit here in an empty Chamber, about 
the kinds of things that I know the 
American people would love for us to 
debate. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Montana for yielding to 
me and for organizing this activity. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas, par-
ticularly for reminding us of the need 
to rebalance and reclaim our Article I 
authority from the runaway bureauc-
racy that we have here in Washington. 
Madam Speaker, we started the Gov-
ernment Efficiency Accountability and 
Reform Task Force for one simple rea-
son: only 17 percent of Americans 
today say they can trust the govern-
ment in Washington. We have to get 
the government working for the people 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I was in Billings, 
Montana, and a gentleman who has 
been drilling natural gas wells for 30 
years told me a story. He said 30 years 
ago when he wanted a permit to drill a 
well, he would go into the field with a 
clipboard, a single piece of paper, and a 
ballpoint pen. He would fill out that 
application. The government official 
would review it in the field and say: 
That will be all right. 
Today, Madam Speaker, that same 
form is 48 pages long, requires an engi-
neer and a lawyer to fill it out, tens of 
thousands of dollars, and months to 
process. 
Clearly, we can do better. 
Our three branches of government 
have drifted from their original pur-
pose to cultivating a culture of waste. 
That is why we have produced this 
playbook of 100 commonsense, non-
partisan solutions for efficiency, ac-
countability, and reform of our Federal 
Government. 
Over this last year, the Republican 
Study Committee GEAR Task Force 
has been meeting with outside experts 
and the administration and internally 
to produce a playbook of commonsense 
solutions for efficiency, accountability, 
and reform of our Federal Government. 
I want to thank the task force mem-
bers, the chairman of the RSC, MIKE 
JOHNSON; BARRY
LOUDERMILK; DOUG 
COLLINS; 
BRUCE
WESTERMAN; 
RICK 
ALLEN; JOHN CURTIS; MICHAEL CLOUD; 
KELLY ARMSTRONG; WILLIAM TIMMONS; 
and DENVER RIGGLEMAN for their en-
gagement and their leadership in pull-
ing together this playbook through 
which we hope to run these common-
sense ideas. 
The report is broken into three sec-
tions. The first section refers to the 
comments made by my colleague who 
just finished on the Article I power in 
the Constitution to restore the people’s 
control over an unchecked bureaucracy 
by returning the constitutional bal-
ance between the branches of govern-
ment. 
Our Founding Fathers never antici-
pated the size of the bureaucracy we 
have today. That is why we need provi-
sions like the REINS Act, so that the 
statutes passed in this House get re-
flected in rules consistent with our in-
tent. 
The second section of the report has 
to do with government practices to 
streamline Federal programs and oper-
ations to promote efficiency and elimi-
nate waste. 
Madam Speaker, in 2015 the Social 
Security Administration told us we 
had sent benefit checks to over 6 mil-
lion Americans who were over the age

of 112. Now, either they are drinking 
some special elixir of life or they are 
not with us anymore. That is why I 
have introduced a piece of legislation 
titled stop paying dead people. I think 
that would be a good reform. It would 
save American taxpayers and make 
sure the benefits are there for those 
who do need Social Security. 
The third section of the report is on 
personnel, to transition government 
personnel 
accountability 
and 
com-
pensation toward more of a merit- 
based system. I operated a number of 
businesses in the private sector, and 
there are many HR practices in the 
Federal Government which are very 
different than they are in the private 
sector, things like merit-based pay, the 
way we do performance reviews, and 
making sure we have market-based pay 
for our good, dedicated Federal work-
ers. Those are contained in the third 
section. 
In total, there are over 100 common-
sense ideas in this report that we will 
run as plays here in the House to make 
the government start working for the 
people again. 
I appreciate the opportunity for the 
Members of the task force and others 
who have engaged on this issue to come 
today and share their commonsense 
ideas. I look forward to partnering to 
put these ideas into practice to get 
government working for the people 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

S971 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2020 
No. 28 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, unto whom all hearts 
are open and all desires known, we put 
our trust in You. 
Today, abide with our lawmakers. 
Teach them to speak the right words at 
the right time. Make their speech like 
precious gold set in silver. May they 
seek to persuade with patient and 
gentle words. Lord, give them the wis-
dom to be friends of that which is eter-
nal and abiding. Fill them with rev-
erence for the transcendent as You in-
duce them to ascribe all good things to 
You. 
We pray in Your gracious Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
our 
colleague 
Senator 
MARTHA 
MCSALLY, of Arizona, announced her 
support yesterday for the bipartisan 
Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction 
Act. I like to refer to it as the Grass-
ley-Wyden prescription drug bill, re-
ducing prices. Senator MCSALLY and I 
worked together on several parts of the 
bill. Her Arizonans should know that 
Senator MCSALLY’s leadership is mak-
ing all the difference in moving this 
bill forward. I thank her for her co-
sponsorship. 
President 
Trump, 
Vice 
President 
PENCE, and nearly a dozen Senate Re-
publicans have, so far, endorsed this 
bill. Several other Senate Republicans 
will soon announce their support as 
well. I expect to introduce an updated 
version in the coming weeks. 
I am confident that, if this bill were 
to be brought up for a vote, it would 
pass overwhelmingly. Let’s not miss an 
opportunity 
then 
to 
deliver 
real 
progress for Americans. This always 
shows up—in other words, drug pricing 
legislation—as one of the three, four, 
or five top issues of the upcoming elec-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
with the impeachment trial behind us, 
the Senate can now get back to the 
business of the American people. 
As the President laid out in his bold 
speech last Tuesday, the state of our 
Union is strong. Over the past 3 years, 
a combination of major Republican 
policy victories and important bipar-
tisan achievements have helped to cre-
ate a historic economic moment for 
working Americans and middle-class 
families. 
Unemployment remains right around 
its lowest point in half a century. The 
percentage of Americans aged 25 to 54 
who have jobs is the highest it has been 
in 20 years. The market for American 
workers is hot, and it is pulling people 
off of the sidelines. As the New York 
Times recently explained, ‘‘Employers 
are hiring candidates with disabilities, 
criminal records and other barriers to 
employment, and are offering perks to 
attract workers.’’ No wonder the per-
centage of Americans who say they are 
financially better off now than they 
were a year ago just hit a 44-year high. 
We have finally seen a drop in opioid 
deaths. In my home State of Kentucky, 
we recently saw the largest decrease in 
fatal drug overdoses in a decade. We 
are rebuilding and modernizing the 
world’s greatest military, and we are 
continuing to renew our Federal judici-
ary with thoroughly qualified men and 
women who understand that a judge’s 
job is to interpret our laws and our 
Constitution as they were actually 
written. 
There is plenty more for the Senate 
to do to keep up this momentum for 
the American people, so we are glad to 
get back to business. 
We will start this week by con-
firming more of President Trump’s 
well-qualified nominees to lifetime ju-
dicial appointments. The first up is 
Judge Andrew Brasher, of Alabama, to 
serve on the Eleventh Circuit. Judge 
Brasher currently serves on the U.S. 
District Court for the Middle District 
of Alabama. He is a Harvard Law grad-
uate who previously clerked on the 
Eleventh Circuit, excelled in private 
practice, and found his way into public 
service as solicitor general for his 
home State. In that role, he was recog-
nized by the National Association of 
Attorneys General for his legal writ-
ing, and his nomination earned a unan-
imous ‘‘well-qualified’’ rating from the 
ABA.

S972 
February 11, 2020 
I look forward to confirming Judge 
Brasher to his next post this afternoon. 
f 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, this week, we ex-
pect the Senate will take up a War 
Powers Resolution by the junior Sen-
ator from Virginia that would severely 
limit the U.S. military’s operational 
flexibility to defend itself against 
threats posed by Iran. I will strongly 
oppose our colleague’s effort and urge 
the Senate to defeat it. 
First, let’s discuss what prompted 
this: the President’s successful decision 
to remove Soleimani from the battle-
field last month. This limited yet deci-
sive precision strike eliminated the 
terrorist mastermind who had been re-
sponsible for more American military 
casualties than anyone else alive. 
This was not some reckless act. It 
was a calculated and limited response 
to a significant, growing threat of at-
tack against U.S. personnel in Iraq by 
an emboldened adversary. Years ago, 
Soleimani had concluded America was 
a paper tiger whose people he could kill 
with relative impunity. It was a strike 
designed to stop an escalation cycle we 
all knew was underway and to restore 
deterrence and reduce the risk of war. 
Yet, when Soleimani’s record of bru-
tality was brought to an end, some 
Washington 
Democrats 
immediately 
suggested President Trump was leading 
us into World War III. While the Middle 
East masses rejoiced at the death of a 
principal architect of Iran’s campaign 
of terror, the Washington elites fret-
ted. 
Yet, 
thus 
far, 
it 
appears 
the 
Soleimani strike has, indeed, had the 
intended effect. As I observed back in 
January, ‘‘We appear to have restored 
a measure of deterrence in the Middle 
East. So let’s not screw it up.’’ Well, I 
am afraid that is just what our col-
league’s resolution would do. Just as 
we have successfully sent Iran the 
strong signal of our strength and re-
solve, a blunt and clumsy War Powers 
Resolution would tie our own hands. 
With China’s and Russia’s watching, 
is it really a good idea to suggest that 
we are willing to let a meddling power 
like Iran push us around? This self- 
flagellation and self-limitation would 
be tantamount to snatching defeat 
from the jaws of victory. 
For 8 years, President Obama and 
Senate Democrats, like my friend the 
Democratic leader himself, frequently 
said that, when it comes to Iran, we 
should never take the military option 
off the table. Yet, now that someone 
else is in the Oval Office, they seem to 
want to remove all options from the 
table. Lest we forget, the fact is that 
we are not conducting ongoing hos-
tilities with Iran. This was a one-off 
operation to disrupt and deter planned 
attacks—not a campaign, not a con-
flict, not a war. 
This discrete and limited exercise of 
American power pales in comparison to 
the ways in which past Presidents of 
both parties have routinely used Presi-
dential authorities to utilize our mili-
tary might without their having the 
prior consent of Congress—President 
Clinton in Kosovo, President Obama in 
Libya, and so on. 
Do most of my distinguished Demo-
cratic colleagues really agree with sev-
eral of their party’s leading Presi-
dential candidates who have suggested 
President Trump made a mistake by 
taking this sort of Executive action to 
eliminate this brutal terrorist? 
Do my colleagues really agree with 
the prominent voices on their side who 
have proposed to exit the Middle East 
altogether rather than to continue to 
work to support our local partners and 
defend our national security and na-
tional interests in this critical region? 
I have been trying to have this broad-
er debate for more than a year now. I 
have repeatedly sought to give my 
Democratic colleagues the opportunity 
to go on record about their actual, big- 
picture strategic vision for the Middle 
East. 
Are they willing to support a contin-
ued military presence in Syria? in 
Iraq? Do they believe we can magically 
support our partners, like the Kurds, 
without having a military presence; 
that we can counter Iranian and Rus-
sian influence if we are nowhere to be 
found in the region? Do they believe 
Israel will be safer in a region without 
American influence? 
Ill-conceived potshots at Presidential 
authorities—in the wake of a strike 
that succeeded—by using the blunt in-
strument of a War Powers Resolution 
is no substitute at all for answering 
these broader questions. 
I will oppose my colleague’s resolu-
tion tomorrow, and I encourage our 
colleagues to do likewise. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—H.R. 5687 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I understand there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er is correct. 
The clerk will read the title of the 
bill for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 5687) making emergency sup-
plemental appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2020, and for other pur-
poses. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I would object to 
further proceedings. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

LEADER 
The

ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the 2020 primary elections are ongoing. 
The national election is only 9 months 
away. If there is anything we can say 
for certain about our elections at this 
point, it is that foreign entities— 
Putin, China, perhaps others—are al-
ready implementing their schemes to 
undermine the public confidence and 
the integrity of those elections and to 
bend social media in favor of their cho-
sen 
outcome. 
FBI 
Director 
Wray, 
former 
DNI 
Coats—virtually 
every 
member of our national security and 
intelligence community has warned us 
of this danger. 
As we have heard over the past 
weeks, the threat of foreign inter-
ference in our election dates back to 
the founding days of the country. 
George Washington warned that for-
eign interference is one of the most 
baneful foes of republican government. 
Adams wrote that as long as elections 
happen, the danger of foreign influence 
recurs. 
The warnings of our Founders hold a 
new and startling relevance today. The 
current President of the United States, 
far from having the same fears about 
foreign interference as our Founders, 
has been very public about his open-
ness to foreign assistance and manipu-
lation in support of his election. If a 
foreign power had dirt on one of his op-
ponents, the President said, ‘‘I think 
I’d want to hear it.’’ At different times, 
the 
President 
has 
invited 
Russia, 
Ukraine, and China to investigate his 
political opponents. 
Of course the President was just im-
peached over this issue, and the Senate 
just concluded a trial in which it ap-
peared a bipartisan majority of Sen-
ators broadly accepted the fact that 
the President leveraged hundreds of 
millions of dollars of military assist-
ance to Ukraine to compel its govern-
ment to investigate one of his political 
rivals. 
The trial of President Trump exposed 
in great detail the President’s willing-
ness to accept foreign help in the elec-
tions. It also revealed just how little 
Senate Republicans were willing to do 
about it. Senate Republicans wouldn’t 
even 
fairly 
examine 
the 
charges 
against the President by allowing wit-
nesses and documents in his trial. 
The end of the President’s impeach-
ment trial does not mean that the end 
of the issue of election security is 
somehow over—far from it. We now 
have even a greater need to safeguard 
our elections than we had before. 
The President tried to cheat in our 
elections, and the Senate majority of

February 11, 2020 
his party decided to look the other 
way. What do you think the President 
will conclude? He will conclude that he 
can get away with anything. He could 
try to cheat again—ask China or North 
Korea or Russia to investigate the 
Democratic nominee, whoever it is. 
We know we can’t trust this Presi-
dent to stand up for the integrity of 
our elections, so Congress must. Demo-
crats are not going to stop fighting to 
put up additional safeguards before the 
2020 elections. 
Later today, a group of my col-
leagues will come to the floor to ask 
unanimous consent to pass crucial 
election security legislation. Much of 
this legislation is bipartisan. Some of 
it has already passed out of committee. 
Some of it has passed the House, but it 
has languished for years—years—be-
cause Majority Leader MCCONNELL has 
refused to bring any of these bills to 
the floor. 
Senator 
WARNER
and 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL
have 
duty-to-report 
bills—commonsense measures to re-
quire Presidential campaigns to report 
offers of foreign help to the FBI. Sen-
ator WYDEN and Senator KLOBUCHAR 
have the SAFE Act—another common-
sense measure to authorize funding to 
harden election infrastructure and pro-
tect voting machines from hacking and 
other intrusions. 
Neither of these bills should be con-
troversial. There is nothing partisan 
about them—nothing at all—but they 
have consistently been blocked by Sen-
ate Republicans and denied time and 
consideration on the floor by Repub-
lican Leader MCCONNELL. That doesn’t 
mean Democrats are going to stop try-
ing. Later today, we will try again to 
pass these bipartisan, noncontroversial 
bills. We will see if our Republican col-
leagues are willing to do what is nec-
essary to protect our elections. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ANDREW LYNN 
BRASHER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
the nomination of Andrew Brasher for 
the Eleventh Circuit, the nomination is 
truly a disgrace—a disgrace—to our ju-
diciary. I urge every single Senator to 
reject it. 
Mr. Brasher is laughably inexperi-
enced. He was confirmed as a district 
court judge only 9 months ago. That is 
the sum total of his experience as a 
judge at any level—9 months. Now 
Leader MCCONNELL wants to elevate 
him to an appellate court. In Leader 
MCCONNELL’s desperate rush to pack 
the courts with hard-right judges, his 
party is asking the Senate to confirm 
judicial novices to the most austere 
and important seats on the Federal 
bench. 
Worse than this nominee’s inexperi-
ence, though, are his views, which are 
so far outside the American main-
stream. 
In his 5 years as solicitor general in 
the State of Alabama, Brasher de-
fended the indefensible on issues rang-
ing from women’s reproductive rights, 
to marriage equality, to gun safety. 
Mr. Brasher has also amassed a ca-
reer’s worth of experience undermining 
voting rights. Brasher signed on to an 
amicus brief that argued in favor of 
gutting the Voting Rights Act—argu-
ably the most important piece of civil 
rights legislation in our Nation’s his-
tory. His arguments in defense of an 
Arizona voter ID law were roundly re-
jected by the Supreme Court, including 
Justice Scalia. As the solicitor general 
for Alabama, Brasher defended the 
State’s voter suppression efforts, in-
cluding State district lines that courts 
later concluded were drawn explicitly 
to discriminate against African-Amer-
ican voters. This is who the Senate Re-
publicans want to put as a circuit 
court of appeals justice. 
Whether it is covering up for Presi-
dent Trump and his attempts to cheat 
in our elections or confirming judges 
like Mr. Brasher with a history of race- 
related voter discrimination, Senate 
Republicans are showing outright con-
tempt for the very wellspring of our de-
mocracy—the right of American citi-
zens to vote in free and fair elections. 
Mr. Brasher clearly, obviously, and 
certainly does not belong on the Elev-
enth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge 
every Senator to vote against his nom-
ination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask

f 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last 
Tuesday, the President delivered his 
State of the Union Address. He dis-
cussed some of our biggest accomplish-
ments over the past 3 years, and, of 
course, chief among those accomplish-
ments is the economic progress we 
have made. 
During the Obama administration, 
our economy spent years in the dol-
drums. American families and Amer-
ican workers struggled to advance in a 
historically slow recovery that left 
some experts predicting that a weaker 
economy would be the new normal. Yet 
Republicans didn’t believe we should be 
resigning ourselves to that future. In 
fact, we knew that the real strength of 
the American economy, American busi-
ness, and American workers was still 
there. 
But we also knew that burdensome 
regulations and an outdated tax code 
were preventing our economy from 
thriving the way it should, so we took 
action. We cut burdensome regulations 
and passed historic reform of our Tax 
Code. We cut tax rates for families, 
doubled the tax credit, and nearly dou-
bled the standard deduction. 
Then we took aim at the parts of the 
Tax Code that were holding back 
American workers and American busi-
nesses. We lowered tax rates across the 
board for owners of small and medium- 
sized businesses, farms, and ranches. 
We lowered our Nation’s massive cor-
porate tax rate, which was the highest 
corporate tax rate in the developed 
world. We expanded business owners’ 
ability to recover the costs of invest-
ments they make in their businesses, 
which frees up cash they can reinvest 
in their operations and their workers. 
We brought the U.S. international tax 
system into the 21st century so that 
American businesses are not operating 
at a competitive disadvantage next to 
their foreign counterparts. 
Tax reform is working. Unemploy-
ment is near its lowest level in 50 
years—50 years. Think about that. For 
the past 12 months, unemployment has 
been below 4 percent, a record that was 
last achieved in the 1960s. African 
Americans, Hispanic Americans and 
Asian Americans all saw record low un-
employment in 2019. Strong economic 
growth has also given discouraged 
workers the confidence to come off of 
the sidelines and to join the workforce. 
Currently, the labor force participa-
tion rate is at its highest level in 7 
years. Last month, the economy cre-
ated 225,000 jobs, well above market ex-
pectations. All told, the economy has 
created an average of 171,000 jobs per 
month over the past 12 months—a 
strong number. 
Wages are growing. For the past 18 
months, wage growth has been at or 
above 3 percent. And as the President 
said in his State of the Union Address, 
this is a ‘‘blue-collar boom.’’ In con-
trast to the Obama administration, in 
this economy, it is blue-collar workers 
who are seeing the strong wage growth. 
Gains in the stock market have been 
good 
news 
for 
American 
workers’ 
401(k)s and pensions. The list goes on. 
Of course, while we have made a lot 
of progress, our work isn’t done. While 
our economy as a whole has thrived, 
our Nation’s farm economy continues 
to struggle. Low commodity and live-
stock prices, natural disasters, and 
protracted trade disputes have made 
the last few years challenging ones for 
farmers and ranchers. 
One of the most important things we 
can do to help the farm economy is ne-
gotiate trade deals that expand mar-
kets for American agriculture products 
and give our farmers and ranchers cer-
tainty about what markets will look 
like going forward. That is why I 
pushed for passage of the United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Trade 
Agree-
ment, which the President signed last 
month. This agreement will maintain 
and expand farmers’ and ranchers’ ac-
cess to the two biggest markets for 
American agricultural products and 
provide certainty about what these 
markets will look like for the foresee-
able future. 
I am particularly pleased about the 
improvements the agreement makes

for the dairy industry, which is a grow-
ing industry in my State of South Da-
kota. We need to conclude more strong 
trade agreements going forward that 
will expand markets for American agri-
culture products. 
The President also mentioned the 
trade agreement we are negotiating 
with China. The President recently 
signed phase one of the agreement, 
which includes a pledge from China to 
substantially increase its imports of 
American agriculture products. That is 
excellent news for farmers and ranch-
ers, but we need to make sure that 
China actually lives up to its commit-
ments. As we know, China doesn’t have 
the best record in this regard, and it is 
important that the United States make 
clear that any agreements must be 
honored. 
We have made a lot of progress for 
the American people over the past 3 
years, but, as I said, there is more 
work to be done. I hope to work with 
my colleagues of both parties this year 
to continue to build on the economic 
progress we have made and create more 
opportunities for American workers. I 
will continue to make the needs of our 
Nation’s farmers and ranchers one of 
my top priorities. I am committed to 
seeing our Nation’s farm economy 
catch up to our economy as a whole. 
I am proud that Republican economic 
policies have made life better for 
American workers. I will continue to 
work to ensure that every American 
has access to the benefits of our strong 
economy.

f 
REMEMBERING BILLIE SUE 
HOGGARD 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, our 
Nation functions thanks to the ex-
traordinary devotion and patriotism of 
the American people. Every city, every 
county, every State, and every party 
has a few patriots who go above and be-
yond, dedicating their whole lives to 
making sure that our system works 
and that our way of life is preserved so 
that we can pass on our Republic as a 
precious inheritance to our children 
and our grandchildren. 
Billie Sue Hoggard was just such a 
patriot. She devoted her life to her 
neighbors 
and 
fellow 
citizens 
in 
Jonesboro in northeast Arkansas. Bil-
lie Sue went home to be with the Lord 
on Sunday at age 76. 
Billie Sue loved America, she loved 
Arkansas, she loved the Republican 
Party with all of her heart, and she de-
voted all of her energy to making them 
great. 
As a young child, sadly, Billie Sue 
knew the meaning of sacrifice. Her 
adoptive father was killed in action 
during the Battle of the Bulge in World 
War II. Although they had not met, he 
kept her baby photo in his wallet. No 
doubt, he was proud to know the baby 
girl he adopted grew up to carry on his 
legacy of service to others. I bet he 
told her that on Sunday when they 
were reunited. 
Billie Sue worked as a teacher in 
northeast Arkansas for decades, help-
ing young people grow up to become 
better citizens. Her career as an educa-
tor was just one part of her commit-
ment to public service. She also served 
as a justice of the peace and the Repub-
lican 
Party 
committee 
chair 
for 
Craighead County, where she brought 
energy and joy and a little bit of 
feistiness to every meeting and every 
local gathering. 
Billie Sue was also a Republican well 
ahead of the pack, back in the day 
when many counties didn’t even have 
committees and some counties could 
probably meet in a telephone booth. 
Her energy and commitment were in-
strumental in helping our party win 
the trust and support of our candidates 
in Jonesboro, in Craighead County, in 
northeast Arkansas, and all around our 
State. It is thanks in no small part to 
her efforts that RICK CRAWFORD now 
represents northeast Arkansas in the 
House of Representatives, the first Re-
publican to hold that seat since recon-
struction. 
I met Billie Sue shortly after my 
election to the House. She encouraged 
me to run for the Senate. She promised 
to deliver Craighead County if I did, 
and I can tell you, she kept that prom-
ise and then some, as she always did. 
Of course, Billie Sue was most com-
mitted of all to her family. Her four 
children, 
seven 
grandchildren, 
and 
three 
great-grandchildren 
were 
the 
loves of her life. In a fitting turn of 
fate, Billie Sue, the adopted daughter 
of a servicemember, served herself as 
guardian to two of her young grand-
daughters in her later years. She was 
in her seventies when she raised those 
two young girls. In an act of love, she 
stepped up for her family in its hour of 
need. 
Billy Sue’s health declined over the 
last year of her life. We all know how 
the battles of illness can rob people we 
love of their vitality in their final 
days. But while cancer could ravage 
her body, it could never dampen Billy 
Sue’s spirit. When I called her over this 
last year to check on her, I always 
heard the same energy and passion— 
and, yes, feistiness—as she wanted to 
skip over quickly how she was doing 
and talk about the latest legislative 
battles here in Congress and political 
campaigns in Arkansas. 
Now Billie Sue has gone back to be 
with the Lord, but she is not forgotten. 
Arkansans will remember her as a local 
leader and a patriot who made her 
community 
and 
our 
State 
better 
through decades of tireless service. 
May she rest in peace. 
I yield the floor.

ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
2020 primary elections are already un-
derway, and the national election is 
only 9 months away. We know that for-
eign entities—Putin, China, perhaps 
others—are already scheming to under-
mine the public confidence in our elec-
tions. The threats to our next elections 
are real and growing nearer each day. 
Last week the Senate concluded an 
impeachment trial of the President, 
who was accused of abusing the powers 
of his office to solicit the help of a for-
eign power in his reelection—solicit 
the help. It didn’t just happen. He was 
soliciting it. 
My Republican Senate friends refused 
to hold the President accountable for 
his misconduct—refused to even hold a 
fair trial. Now, what do we think the 
President will conclude after the Sen-
ate Republican majority let him off the 
hook for trying to cheat in our elec-
tions? He will conclude that he can try 
to do it again. Anyone who knows him 
knows that is what he will do. 
Because Senate Republicans chose to 
look the other way, the need for elec-
tion security legislation is greater now 
than ever before. We cannot trust this 
President to stand up for the integrity 
of our elections. So Congress must 
stand up in his stead. 
In a few moments, my colleagues 
Senator WARNER, Senator WYDEN, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S975 
February 11, 2020 
Senator BLUMENTHAL will ask for unan-
imous consent to pass crucial election 
security legislation. They will talk 
about what their legislation will do. 
But know this: Protecting our elec-
tions should not be partisan. It should 
not be controversial. It should earn the 
unanimous support of every Member. 
The very wellspring of our democracy 
is the principle of free and fair elec-
tions. Will our Republican colleagues 
stand up for free and fair elections 
today or will they once again block 
commonsense legislation to defend our 
democracy? 
I yield to the Senator from Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank 
the Democratic leader. 
I am here today because I think, as 
we all know, our elections remain vul-
nerable 
to 
foreign 
election 
inter-
ference. Russia attacked our democ-
racy in 2016, with the goal of under-
mining confidence in our system, a sys-
tem of free and fair elections—lit-
erally, the bedrock of our democracy. 
Their 
cyber 
attacks 
and 
disinformation efforts continue to this 
day, and our own FBI Director, Chris-
topher Wray, has reassured or, poten-
tially, warned us that they will be back 
in full force this year. Not only that, 
but we will have to contend with po-
tential interference from China, Iran, 
North Korea, and others who have basi-
cally copied the Russia playbook. 
The threat is real, it is ongoing, and 
we are not doing enough to be ready. 
Time and again we hear these same 
warnings from our intelligence commu-
nity leadership, from companies like 
Facebook, from the special counsel, 
and many others. The truth is that the 
alarm bells are going off, and we are 
running out of time to actually do 
something about it. 
Unfortunately, the White House and 
the U.S. Senate seem to be the only 
ones not taking this threat seriously. 
Since 2016, this body, which we all have 
the honor to serve in, has failed to vote 
on a single piece of standalone election 
security legislation. Three times last 
year I came to the floor in an attempt 
to pass bipartisan election security leg-
islation by unanimous consent, and 
each time these efforts were blocked by 
some of my Republican colleagues— 
blocked and actually earned applause 
from the President on Twitter for their 
actions. 
Well, I am back again today because 
the security of our elections cannot 
wait. In a moment, I will ask unani-
mous consent to pass my legislation 
known as the FIRE Act. This bill 
would simply say to all Presidential 
campaigns going forward that if a for-
eign power reaches out to your cam-
paign offering assistance or offering 
dirt on a political opponent, the appro-
priate response is not to say thank 
you. The appropriate response is to call 
the FBI. 
I introduced this bipartisan legisla-
tion months before the facts came to 
light about the President pressuring 
Ukraine into announcing a politically 
motivated 
investigation 
into 
the 
Bidens. 
Now, I am not here to rehash the im-
peachment trial, but I do want to note 
one thing. A number of my Republican 
colleagues justified their votes by say-
ing that, while not impeachable, it was 
wrong for the President to solicit for-
eign interference in our elections. I 
take my colleagues at their word that 
they believe foreign interference has 
no place in our elections, but if I take 
you at your word, you have got to put 
your money where your mouth is. We 
are under attack from our adversaries, 
who see this new era of cyber warfare 
and disinformation as a unique and 
golden 
opportunity 
to 
undermine 
American democracy. 
We cannot afford to have a system 
that allows any Presidential candidate 
to welcome this kind of interference 
with open arms. If we can’t trust the 
President of the United States and his 
campaign to do the right thing and re-
port foreign interference, then we need 
to require it by law. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2242 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Rules Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 2242, the 
FIRE Act; that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration; that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
reserve the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
would like to articulate the reason for 
the objection to the legislation brought 
forward by the minority. 
You would think that, after spending 
weeks in this Chamber litigating the 
finer points of their disagreements 
with the President’s foreign policy, our 
friends in the minority would be weary 
of picking another partisan fight. But 
here we go again. 
They are attempting to bypass this 
body’s Rules Committee on behalf of 
various bills that will seize control 
over elections from the States and take 
it from the States. And where do they 
want to put it? They want it to rest in 
the hands of Washington, DC, bureau-
crats. 
As I have said on this floor before, I 
served on a local election commission. 
I know how hard our friends and neigh-
bors and our local election commis-
sions and our State election commis-
sions work to ensure the integrity of 
the ballot box. 
What would these bills that are going 
to be brought forward this morning do? 
They would centralize control over the 
vote, and what we have seen is big cen-
tralized out-of-control government. We 
would end up having a less safe elec-
toral process. It would be more vulner-
able to attack. 
It is absolutely baffling to me that 
the minority would fight so hard for 
such a disastrous vision, but, as I said, 
here we go again. Their actions show 
complete contempt for the progress 
that Congress, the intelligence commu-
nity, and State-level authorities have 
made to protect our elections without 
resorting to a Federal power grab. 
Since fiscal year 2018, Congress has 
invested $805 million in protecting the 
vote. This is the largest investment in 
elections since the 2002 Help America 
Vote Act. And do you know what? It is 
making a difference. It is making a dif-
ference. 
Why, then, would the minority con-
tinue to demand changes that would 
redirect that investment to support 
groups 
like 
the 
Iowa 
Democratic 
Party, whose mishandling of their own 
caucus ended in what has been termed 
by everyone as an unmitigated dis-
aster? 
They know it is not necessary, and 
yet time and again they are trying to 
force this issue. They feel like only the 
bureaucrats in Washington, DC, can 
handle this. 
So in response to this gross hypoc-
risy, today I am filing my own bill di-
recting 
the 
Government 
Account-
ability Office to look into the debacle 
in Iowa. 
I send a bill to the desk, and I ask 
that it be appropriately referred. 
This is not an attack. This is a rec-
ognition that any complex process 
comes with the risk of mistakes or 
mismanagement. We are all vulnerable. 
We must recognize this. We must inves-
tigate allegations of fraud and mis-
management, and, of course, there 
should be lessons learned from the 
past. To ignore these problems is to re-
sign ourselves to a fatally flawed 
democratic process. 
On that note, I do object to the mo-
tion, and I ask my colleagues to re-
member that we have reached a bipar-
tisan consensus on the importance of 
securing our elections. We are all 
against election interference. We are 
all against foreign interference in elec-
tions. We are all for free and fair elec-
tions, and we are all for protecting the 
ballot box. 
So I hope my Democratic colleagues 
do not resort to sending out more fund-
raising letters saying that the Repub-
licans are opposed to a secure election 
process, because that is a falsehood. We 
are not. We are for a fair process. We 
do not believe federalizing that process 
and taking the power away from local 
governments and State governments is 
the way to do that. 
So let’s focus on the bipartisan con-
sensus, and let’s not throw that away 
in the name of having another partisan 
grudge match. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S976 
February 11, 2020 
State 
and 
local 
election 
security, 
which I support. 
I see two members of the Senate In-
telligence Committee on the floor, and 
I am extraordinarily proud of the bi-
partisan, unanimous work that we 
have done to point out what happened 
in 2016 and to lay out with a great deal 
of specificity what we need to do as a 
nation to protect ourselves in 2020. 
This legislation I am proposing today 
is really kind of the simplest, lowest 
hanging fruit. I think we all say that 
we don’t want foreigners interfering in 
our elections. All this legislation says 
is if a foreign government or foreign 
agents interfere to try to help or hurt 
any Presidential candidate, we ought 
to make sure there is no ambiguity 
that the appropriate response is not to 
say thank you but the appropriate re-
sponse is to call the FBI. 
That is the message we have heard 
from Director Wray. That is the mes-
sage we have heard from the intel-
ligence community. If we can’t agree 
on that, gracious, where are we? 
And, candidly, in other times we 
might not have needed this kind of leg-
islation. It seems so patently obvious. 
I am disappointed with the objection. 
We will keep trying. 
With that, I yield the floor to my col-
league from Oregon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2238 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to 
thank the vice chair of the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence and pick up on 
his remarks. 
For my colleagues, I believe they 
have asked that I give my remarks be-
fore I offer my unanimous consent re-
quest, and that is what I will do. 
Mr. President, America is 266 days 
away from the 2020 elections, and Ma-
jority Leader MCCONNELL has yet to 
take any concrete steps to protect our 
foreign elections from hacking or for-
eign interference. Thanks to this legis-
lative blockade, the Senate has been 
totally derelict in its duty to stop for-
eign cyber attacks on our election. 
I want to give just one concrete ex-
ample, having listened to my colleague 
from Tennessee. There is not one single 
nationwide, mandatory election cyber 
security standard on the books. That 
means there is not even a prohibition 
on voting machines having an open 
connection to the internet. Colleagues, 
that is the equivalent of stashing our 
ballots in the Kremlin. There is no 
such cyber security prohibition. 
The election security debacle of 2016 
was 4 years ago, but still this body has 
refused to act. We know Russian hack-
ers probed all 50 State election sys-
tems. They hacked at least one elec-
tion vendor. Russians penetrated two 
Florida county election systems, ac-
cording to Florida’s Governor. That is 
just what we know about. 
Despite all the ways foreign hackers 
have already made it into our election 
infrastructure, the Congress has re-
fused to arm State and county officials 
with the knowledge and funding they 
need to secure their systems. 
I will state what I tell my constitu-
ents at townhall meetings at home— 
and I have more of them scheduled this 
weekend—I believe, as of today, the 
2020 election is going to make 2016 look 
like small potatoes. The list of threats 
and vulnerabilities ought to be a wake- 
up call—a wake-up call—for every 
Member of this Senate. There were the 
ES&S voting machines that for years 
came with preinstalled remote-access 
software. There is the fact that Russia 
hacked an election vendor called VR 
Systems in the summer of 2016. VR 
Systems electronic poll books in North 
Carolina malfunctioned on election day 
that year, and one polling place had to 
shut down for hours. It was 21⁄2 years 
before the Department of Homeland 
Security even investigated what had 
happened, and the government still has 
not adequately responded to questions 
I and Senator KLOBUCHAR have asked 
about this. 
Right now, many election officials 
across the country are buying election 
systems that they believe in good faith 
are high tech, but they are in fact vul-
nerable to hacking and are outdated 
the moment they come out of the box. 
There is the alarming trend of states 
using mobile voting apps, like Voatz, 
that haven’t been vetted by top secu-
rity experts. 
This is the reason why so many cyber 
security experts have been sounding 
the alarms for years, warning that put-
ting computers between a voter and 
their ballots is a prescription for dis-
aster. What happens when a ‘‘glitch’’ 
changes a candidate’s vote totals by 
just 2 percent or 5 percent instead of 50 
percent? What happens when a glitch 
shuts down machines in some precincts 
and not others, disenfranchising voters 
and skewing election results? 
Five States still exclusively use 
hackable, paperless voting machines, 
and 
nine 
other 
States 
still 
use 
paperless machines in some counties. 
These are serious problems, but there 
are some clear solutions. I proposed a 
bill called the PAVE Act, which has 
three key priorities that are univer-
sally supported by people who are 
knowledgeable in the election security 
field: paper ballots, routine post-elec-
tion risk-limiting audits, and manda-
tory Federal cyber security standards 
for election systems. 
Last year, the House passed a major 
election security bill called the SAFE 
Act, which included most of the PAVE 
Act. Senator KLOBUCHAR and I, on be-
half of colleagues on this side of the 
aisle, introduced the Senate version of 
the SAFE Act. The SAFE Act has all 
three key elements recommended by 
our Nation’s top cyber security ex-
perts—paper ballots, security stand-
ards, and postelection audits—as well 
as the funding necessary to make sure 
States can live up to the new stand-
ards. 
The SAFE Act, in my view, rep-
resents the most comprehensive com-
monsense defense against foreign elec-
tion hacking. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to reconsider their opposition 
to this vitally important legislation. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Rules and Administration Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. 2238, the SAFE Act; that the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Just to give a brief re-
sponse, I think it is unfortunate that 
my colleague is not even willing to en-
gage in this discussion with respect to 
this. 
I just want my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to think about 
their claims. They are saying, for ex-
ample, that, well, they are sympathetic 
to the idea that there should be more 
money for election officials. The recent 
appropriations funding doesn’t even 
have a requirement that it be spent on 
election security. States can buy brand 
new, insecure paperless voting ma-
chines that are pretty much useless 
when they come out of the box. They 
can even use the money to buy office 
chairs or a water cooler for the elec-
tion office. 
Again, I come back, and I hope my 
colleague from Tennessee will reflect 
on this because she is somebody who 
has spent a lot of time on technology 
issues. 
The idea that this Senate is willing 
to say ‘‘You know, we are not even 
going to do something. We are not even 
going to act’’ when you can have vot-
ing machines with an open connection 
to the internet—it is just like stashing 
our ballots in the Kremlin. Something 
really is out of whack, and we ought to 
be coming together and passing the 
SAFE Act. We at least ought to be 
talking about it. What we have is a 
specific, documented case for an impor-
tant piece of legislation, and the ma-
jority just says: That is the way it is.

passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
really regret there is an objection 
again to this bill which we have been 
seeking for floor consideration in this 
body to debate and pass. 
We have been asking for floor consid-
eration of various election security 
bills in the last several months—the 
PAVE Act, the Honest Ads Act, and the 
SHIELD Act—but, sadly and unfortu-
nately for the country, the majority 
continues to stonewall. Our decisions 
are under attack, our elections are 
under siege, and 2016 was only a dress 
rehearsal. 
Just yesterday, Attorney General 
Barr announced that Trump’s personal 
attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is going to be 
feeding the Department of Justice 
unverified dirt from Ukraine on the 
President’s political rival. In effect, 
the Department of Justice will become 
a political tool for the President. He is 
weaponizing law enforcement for his 
personal political end, and the Attor-
ney General of the United States is be-
coming an aider and abettor to that po-
larization and politicization of the De-
partment of Justice. 
Only last week, for the first time in 
our Nation’s history, we saw bipartisan 
support for removing the President 
from office. The basis for that bipar-
tisan vote was, in fact, President 
Trump’s illegal solicitation of election 
interference from a foreign govern-
ment. 
As Senator ROMNEY put it last week, 
Trump’s demands of Ukraine con-
stitute a ‘‘flagrant assault on our elec-
toral rights, our national security and 
our fundamental values,’’ noting that 
‘‘corrupting an election to keep oneself 
in office is perhaps the most abusive 
and destructive violation of one’s oath 
of office that I can imagine.’’ He is 
right. We cannot allow this abuse to 
become the new normal, and it is fast 
becoming normalized. 
My other Republican colleagues are 
running out of time to be on the right 
side of history. Others have conceded 
that 
what 
the 
President 
did 
was 
‘‘wrong. Inappropriate . . . crossing the 
line,’’ as Senator ALEXANDER put it. 
Senator MURKOWSKI stated that she 
believed that ‘‘the President’s behavior 
was shameful and wrong. His personal 
interests do not take precedence over 
those of this great nation.’’ 
Senator COLLINS, who first claimed 
that Trump learned his ‘‘lesson,’’ has 
since admitted that she ‘‘may not be 
correct on that’’ after the President re-
fused to admit any wrongdoing. 
Now that Senate Republicans have 
let President Trump off the hook, there 
is no doubt that he will only be 
emboldened in his efforts to illegally 
enlist foreign governments in his re-
election campaign. 
What 
is 
happening 
with 
Rudy 
Giuliani, Senator GRAHAM
has said, 
may be that he has been ‘‘played by the 
Russians.’’ That, in fact, is likely what 
is happening, but the President’s per-
sonal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, may 
also be playing the President, and the 
President most certainly will be play-
ing the country if he uses the Depart-
ment of Justice for his personal polit-
ical aims and enlists foreign inter-
ference in our election. 
That is why this bill is so critically 
important. The Duty to Report Act of-
fers my Republican colleagues the op-
portunity to start redeeming them-
selves for their votes last week. 
If they really believe the President’s 
actions were wrong, they should sup-
port this legislation. It is a very simple 
idea. Really, it is so simple that a lot 
of people believe it is already the law— 
if you see something, say something. If 
you see a violation of law with a for-
eign government interfering in our 
election, if you see an attempt to enlist 
that foreign government, if you see an 
acceptance of assistance, report it. 
The Duty to Report Act would re-
quire campaigns, candidates, and fam-
ily members to immediately report to 
the FBI and the Federal Election Com-
mission any offers of foreign assist-
ance. Simple. It codifies into law what 
is already a moral duty, a patriotic 
duty, and basic common sense. 
It is already illegal to accept foreign 
assistance during a campaign. It is al-
ready illegal to solicit foreign assist-
ance during a campaign. All this bill 
does is require campaigns and individ-
uals to report what is already illegal to 
the FBI so law enforcement can protect 
our great Nation. This legislation 
would ensure that if the Trump cam-
paign or any campaign were offered as-
sistance from a foreign, hostile govern-
ment in a future election, the FBI 
would be informed and could act to 
protect our country. 
Let me repeat: 2016 was a dress re-
hearsal for what our intelligence com-
munity is already reporting as ongoing 
right now in election interference, and 
it is more than Russia. It is other na-
tions. Already, Iran has proved to be an 
active and present disrupter, and other 
nations will follow their lead. 
With the 2020 election looming, we 
need to stop this kind of foreign inter-
ference and ensure that it is the Amer-
ican people, not Russia, China, Iran, or 
any other nation, who decides who our 
leaders will be and the direction of our 
democracy—and not just decide but 
also influence and impact in ways that 
are opaque and concealed, pernicious 
and insidious. We need to act to pro-
vide a duty to report. 
I regret the objection to our unani-
mous consent request, and I, certainly, 
along with my colleagues on this side 
of the aisle, will continue this effort to 
fight to protect our Nation against for-
eign interference. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that before we re-
cess, I be allowed to finish my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ANDREW LYNN BRASHER 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in the U.S. Senate in support of 
Andrew Brasher of Montgomery, AL, 
whom I recommended and was later 
nominated by President Trump to sit 
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Eleventh Circuit, a very important 
post. 
I believe Judge Brasher to be an es-
teemed choice for this high honor. For-
merly Alabama’s solicitor general and 
currently a U.S. district judge for the 
Middle District of Alabama, Judge 
Brasher is no stranger to the court-
room. I have the utmost regard for his 
vast legal ability and his commitment 
to the rule of law, and I believe he is 
well suited for this respected position. 
Judge Brasher excelled academically 
from a young age. He earned his bach-
elor of arts with honors from Samford 
University in Birmingham, AL, where 
he graduated summa cum laude and 
met his wife Julia there. He currently 
serves on the school’s board of over-
seers. 
Judge Brasher went on from Samford 
University in Birmingham to graduate 
cum laude from Harvard Law School 
and was the first in his family to re-
ceive his juris doctorate. While in law 
school at Harvard, he was a member of 
the Harvard Law Review and received 
the Victor Brudney Prize. The Pre-
siding Officer probably recalls this, but 
this is a high honor at Harvard granted 
annually at the law school to the best 
student paper on a subject associated 
with corporate governance. This is a 
very high honor. 
Upon 
graduation, 
Judge 
Brasher 
served as a law clerk to Judge William 
H. Pryor, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Eleventh Circuit, making 
him neither a stranger to the court-
room nor to the Eleventh Circuit. Fol-
lowing his clerkship with Judge Pryor, 
Andrew Brasher practiced law in Bir-
mingham, AL, with the law firm Brad-
ley Arant Boult Cummings. During his 
time with Bradley Arant, he worked in 
the firm’s litigation and white-collar 
criminal defense practice groups. He 
eventually joined the Alabama attor-
ney general’s office, serving for several 
years as the deputy solicitor general 
and then went on to become the solic-
itor general for the State of Alabama. 
Judge Brasher’s experience speaks 
for itself. He has argued and won cases 
before the U.S. Supreme Court, the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh 
Circuit, and the Supreme Court of Ala-
bama. While serving as solicitor gen-
eral of the State of Alabama, Judge 
Brasher won two Best Brief Award hon-
ors from the National Association of 
Attorneys General. This accomplish-
ment, as the Presiding Officer knows,

February 11, 2020 
is no easy feat. He proved to be an ex-
ceptionally skilled attorney, but his 
ambitions did not stop there. 
In 2018, the Presiding Officer prob-
ably will remember, I recommended 
and President Trump nominated An-
drew Brasher to serve on the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the Middle District of 
Alabama. Last year, he was confirmed 
by the full Senate to sit on the court as 
a Federal district judge. 
Since 
his 
confirmation, 
Judge 
Brasher has served the State of Ala-
bama and the Nation with integrity 
and purpose. I am confident that in his 
new capacity, he will continue to do so. 
I believe Judge Brasher is very worthy 
of this nomination. His judicial tem-
perament and respect for the law, as it 
is written, will help him exhibit, I be-
lieve, impartiality and fairness with 
tact. 
President Trump, I believe, has made 
the right decision in selecting Judge 
Brasher for this important job. I be-
lieve he will be an asset to our judicial 
branch on the Eleventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals. 
I am hopeful that my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle will vote to con-
firm Andrew Brasher without reserva-
tion later today. I remain confident 
that his dedication to justice will con-
tribute to the respected standards of 
our Nation’s judicial system. I wish 
Judge Brasher and his wife Julia— 
along with their two boys, Hank and 
Drew—all the best as they take on this 
new opportunity and responsibility. 
I yield the floor. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, Senator MCCONNELL has sched-
uled votes on five judicial nominees. 
Some of these nominees, I will op-
pose, including 11th Circuit nominee 
Andrew Brasher. Some, I will support, 
including John Kness, a nominee for 
the Northern District of Illinois, who 
was part of a bipartisan package of 
nominees in my State. 
But first, I want to point out that, 
under this Republican majority, the 
Senate simply doesn’t do legislation 
any more. There are literally hundreds 
of bills that have passed the House of 
Representatives and are gathering dust 
on the Senate desk. 
These bills deal with critical issues 
like reducing prescription drug prices, 
protecting pensions, securing our elec-
tions from foreign interference, and 
closing gaps in our gun background 
check system, but time and again, 
when Senate Republicans have the op-
portunity to bring bills to the floor, 
they take a pass. They just don’t want 
to do the hard work of legislating. Last 
year, the Senate voted on only 22 
amendments all year. I remember when 
we used to vote on that many amend-
ments in a single day. 
Sadly, under this Republican major-
ity, the Senate is becoming an append-
age of the White House and no more 
than a conveyor belt for President 
Trump’s judicial nominees. We are ab-
dicating our responsibility to legislate 
on matters of importance to the Amer-
ican people. 
The Constitution assigns the Senate 
important roles as part of a coequal 
legislative branch. We are not rising to 
meet these challenges. When we look 
at this week’s nominations votes, we 
are reminded yet again of how the Sen-
ate is abdicating its authority. 
Andrew Brasher is the 18th Trump 
circuit court nominee who has been 
moved through the Senate Judiciary 
Committee without blue slips from 
both home State Senators. For a cen-
tury, blue slips served as a critical 
check in the system, helping ensure 
that Senators, as the elected represent-
atives of their State’s citizens, have a 
role in choosing the Federal judges who 
will serve lifetime appointments in 
their State. 
But Republicans, who used blue slips 
to obstruct many of President Obama’s 
nominees, cast aside the blue slip once 
President Trump came into office. 
Now, circuit court nominees are rou-
tinely being rammed through the Sen-
ate over the objections of home State 
Senators. Some of these nominees are 
lightly qualified, to put it nicely. Some 
have barely practiced law in the State 
in which they have been nominated to 
serve. Some have barely seen the inside 
of a courtroom. 
Today’s nominee, 38-year-old Andrew 
Brasher, was confirmed as a district 
court judge last year without bipar-
tisan support. Less than a year later, 
he is being put forward for the 11th Cir-
cuit. A former solicitor general of Ala-
bama, he worked on controversial ef-
forts to restrict voting rights, limit re-
productive rights, and undermine gun 
safety laws. 
But beyond the controversial advo-
cacy that he undertook on behalf of his 
clients, Andrew Brasher also made 
comments in his personal capacity that 
call into question his impartiality and 
temperament. This includes a 2015 blog 
post he wrote in opposition to same-sex 
marriage and a speech he gave at a 2014 
pro-life political rally where he said, 
‘‘The ACLU and Planned Parenthood 
want a fight and we will give them 
one.’’ 
I will oppose the Brasher nomination, 
and I will also oppose Alaska district 
court nominee Joshua Kindred, who 
has a lengthy record of opposition to 
environmental protections. Mr. Kin-
dred once described environmentalists 
as being driven by ‘‘passionate igno-
rance.’’ 
I will vote in support of the nomina-
tion of John Kness to the Northern Dis-
trict of Illinois. Mr. Kness is the final 
part of a package of four Illinois dis-
trict court nominees that was agreed 
upon 
between 
myself, 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH, the Illinois Republican 
congressional 
delegation, 
and 
the 
White House. It is a good bipartisan 
package. 
Mr. Kness is a graduate of North-
western and Northwestern Law and a 
former Assistant U.S. Attorney. He is 
currently the general counsel for the 
College of DuPage. He is diligent, 
thoughtful, and principled, and I urge 
my colleagues to support his nomina-
tion. 
f 
RECESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate stands in recess until 2:15 p.m. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:38 p.m., 
recessed until 2:15 p.m. and reassem-
bled when called to order by the Pre-
siding Officer (Mrs. CAPITO). 
NOMINATION OF ANDREW LYNN BRASHER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate will vote on the nomination 
of Andrew Brasher for an Alabama seat 
on the 11th Circuit. This is over the ob-
jection of Senator JONES, who was not 
meaningfully consulted by the admin-
istration and did not return a blue slip. 
Senator JONES is as reasonable as they 
come; the fact that he was denied a 
voice in this process shows just how 
disinterested the White House is in 
being reasonable when it comes to se-
lecting judges who will shape the laws 
in our States for decades to come. 
It is clear the President views the 
courts as a mere extension of his 
power, not as an independent body crit-
ical to the checks and balances of our 
constitutional system. The President 
knows that no matter who is nomi-
nated, whether or not qualified or 
within the mainstream, the Judiciary 
Committee of today and the Senate of 
today—led by a majority leader who 
describes the Senate’s role as a mere 
conveyor belt for President Trump’s 
nominees—will confirm them. 
The President likes to brag about the 
number of judges that have been con-
firmed under his administration. Less 
attention is paid to the cost. Of the 
last 20 circuit court nominees the Judi-
ciary Committee has reported, 15 have 
been along party lines, and 13 had a 
negative blue slip. My friends across 
the aisle apparently no longer care 
about the constitutional principle of 
providing advice and consent to nomi-
nees in your home State, a tradition 
that, until recently, had been guarded 
by members of both parties. 
Blue slips aside, Andrew Brasher had 
served as district court judge for just 7 
months before receiving this Presi-
dential promotion. Every single Demo-
crat opposed his nomination when it 
was reported out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee and again when it was consid-
ered on the Senate floor. During his 
short tenure as a district court judge, 
he has presided over only three cases 
that have gone to verdict or judgment. 
In his questionnaire, when asked what 
significant opinions on Federal con-
stitutional issues he has written, he 
simply wrote ‘‘none.’’ 
But of course, the President did not 
select Brasher for his judicial experi-
ence. A partisan judicial philosophy, 
along with youth, seem to be the only 
qualifications of many of this adminis-
tration’s nominees. Before becoming a 
judge, Brasher spent his short legal ca-
reer 
systematically 
restricting

rights of vulnerable populations, in-
cluding opposing voting rights and 
LGBTQ rights and supporting an un-
constitutional 
law 
mandating 
uni-
versal drug testing for food stamp ap-
plicants, which the 11th Circuit slapped 
down as stripping away peoples’ pri-
vacy simply because they are poor. 
Brasher is opposed by literally hun-
dreds of civil and human rights groups 
who represent millions of Americans. 
They all are afraid that with this ele-
vation, he will continue to be a 
rubberstamp for the President’s radical 
agenda and negatively impact 37 mil-
lion residents of Alabama, Florida and 
Georgia—States that have often been 
on the frontlines of systemic voter dis-
enfranchisement for years. 
For these reasons, I will oppose the 
nomination of Andrew Brasher. We all 
must 
commit 
to 
considering 
each 
nominee carefully and on his or her in-
dividual merit. I hope this body can re-
verse course and return to its historic 
roots: tackling our Nation’s most seri-
ous problems in a bipartisan way, dis-
playing comity even when we disagree, 
and treating our unique role in approv-
ing lifetime judgeships with the seri-
ousness of purpose required by the Con-
stitution.

THE 2020 ELECTION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor as the Democrats 
seem to be in complete disarray with 
the voting right now that is underway 
in New Hampshire. For all of their 
anger and for all of their outrage, they 
have failed to tap into all of the great 
things that I and the people of Wyo-
ming see happening all across America. 
The Democratic primary voters in New 
Hampshire seem to be on the verge of 
nominating a Socialist for President of 
the United States. Any way you look 
at it, we have a strong, healthy, and 
growing economy, and a Socialist is 
now the frontrunner for the Demo-
cratic nomination for President. 
Socialist policies would bankrupt our 
country. What is the Democrats’ top 
priority? It seems to be a complete 
government takeover of healthcare in 
America. That means, for the 180 mil-
lion Americans who get their health in-
surance through their jobs, each and 
every one of them would lose it. Also, 
to pay for it, taxes would go up. They 
would go up significantly. This would 
be a crushing blow to the economy. 
The Democratic Party’s sharp left 
turn has President Clinton’s long-term 
strategist James Carville ‘‘scared to 
death.’’ 
On Friday, James Carville said: ‘‘We 
have candidates . . . talking about 
open borders.’’ 
He said: ‘‘They’re talking about 
doing away with nuclear energy and 
fracking.’’ 
Then he added: ‘‘You’ve got BERNIE 
SANDERS talking about letting crimi-
nals and terrorists vote from jail 
cells.’’ 
During Friday’s debate in New Hamp-
shire—the one that was nationally 
broadcast—there was hardly a positive 
word from the Democrats about our 
country. Our booming economy con-
tinues to create jobs at a record pace— 
millions of jobs. In the last month 
alone, there were 225,000 new jobs. We 
have a 50-year low in unemployment in 
our country right now. It is a historical 
number. We have created opportunity 
for all Americans. Everyone is better 
off. Middle-class wages and blue-collar 
wages are way up. We have a middle- 
class and a blue-collar boom in this 
country. Americans realize it, and they 
have high hopes for the future. 
Still, the 2020 Democrats seem to 
have nothing positive to say about our 
economy and our country—no positive 
ideas, no positive vision, no positive 
agenda for the American people. Clear-
ly, when I listen to them, it is all about 
grandstanding, not about governing. 
The Republicans, however, have a re-
sults-driven agenda. The economic ren-
aissance that we are seeing is a direct 
result of Republican pro-growth poli-
cies. Tax and regulatory relief is what 
has mattered to this economy. Energy 
independence is what has mattered to 
this economy. Pro-worker and pro- 
farmer trade deals are what have made 
a difference for this economy. We re-
main focused on priority issues, like 
lowering the cost of healthcare, low-
ering the cost of prescription drugs, se-
curing our border, and building and re-
building our aging roads and bridges. 
As the President said just last Tues-
day night during the State of the 
Union Address, ‘‘The best is yet to 
come.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
TAX REFORM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
since tax reform was enacted in De-
cember of 2017, our economy has grown 
and strengthened with American fami-
lies’ and businesses’ seeing real bene-
fits, and you just heard Senator BAR-
RASSO say some of the same things 
about how the economy is booming. 
Unemployment rates have dropped 
dramatically, 
with 
unemployment 
among Hispanic, Latino, and African- 
American workers at record lows. Ac-
cording to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics, average hourly earnings have 
grown at a rate of 3 percent or higher 
for 16 consecutive months, with the 
largest wage gains being concentrated 
in the bottom quarter of the wage 
scale. We should duly note that produc-
tion workers’ wages are growing much 
faster than are the wages for the man-
ager class. In short, lower income 
workers are seeing the highest wage 
growth. 
Yet, instead of looking at the posi-
tive economic effects of tax reform, our 
Democratic colleagues insist that large 
corporations have received a massive 
giveaway and that only the wealthy 
have benefited. That is simply not 
true. Tax reform has addressed a num-
ber of issues that have been frequently 
highlighted by both political parties. 
In particular, tax reform has made 
enormous progress toward creating a 
more 
competitive 
environment 
for 
American companies. Before tax re-
form, the combined U.S. Federal and 
State corporate tax rate was the high-
est in the developed world—15 percent-
age points higher than the average of 
the other 35 advanced economies that 
are members of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment, which we commonly refer to 
around here as OECD. 
Over the last few years and before 
the tax bill, you heard of companies 
going overseas. We had inversions, for-
eign acquisitions of U.S. companies, 
and the erosion of the U.S. tax base. 
These were all very significant prob-
lems that we addressed in the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act of 2017. With our world-
wide tax system, companies were actu-
ally incentivized to store corporate 
profits in low-tax jurisdictions over-
seas rather than to reinvest them back 
here in the United States. 
How can that help the U.S. economy? 
We had perverse incentives to keep 
wealth out of this country. Ironically, 
even the Democrats highlighted these 
same issues in the lead-up to tax re-
form—a bipartisan recognition that we 
shouldn’t have a tax system that en-
courages the storing of money overseas 
but rather one that brings that money 
and capital back to the United States 
to create jobs here. They are only par-
tisan issues now, as it turns out, be-
cause tax reform was a Republican ef-
fort, but both sides of the aisle knew 
that these issues had to be addressed in 
order for U.S. companies to remain 
competitive and for the U.S. economy 
to continue leading the world. 
Critics of tax reform complain that 
the 21-percent rate is too low, but with 
the average corporate tax rate of 21.7 
percent among the OECD countries 
today, the United States is finally in 
line with its peers. In other words, we 
can be competitive. 
As a result, U.S. companies are com-
petitive, and investments in the United 
States are more attractive not only to 
foreign companies but to U.S. compa-
nies that used to store money overseas. 
After tax reform legislation passed in 
2017, business investment rose by 6.4 
percent in 2018. 
While a weaker global economy, tar-
iffs, and other factors subdued growth 
last year in 2019, business investment 
in 2018 and 2019 combined was still $5.7 
trillion, hitting record highs. 
Capital expenditures of S&P 500 com-
panies have risen by 17 percent since 
tax reform, and research and develop-
ment expenditures of S&P 500 compa-
nies rose by 18 percent. All of this is 
showing that our law accomplished 
what we wanted it to accomplish. It is 
hardly, then, the anemic response to 
tax reform that the Democrat critics 
would have us believe. 
Tax reform has changed our inter-
national tax rules to remove barriers 
that previously prevented companies 
from bringing foreign earnings home. 
In the seven quarters since enactment 
of tax reform, U.S. companies have 
brought back to the United States 
more than $1 trillion of foreign earn-
ings. 
Obviously, U.S. companies are using 
these earnings to finance new capital 
expenditures, increase research and de-
velopment, increase payrolls, pay down 
debt, and return cash to shareholders 
and retirement accounts. Companies 
are putting those earnings to work in 
this country, not leaving them abroad. 
That economic gain and the jobs cre-
ated as a result of it are because of the 
2017 tax cut legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S982 
February 11, 2020 
But we also took care to ensure that 
companies wouldn’t be able to take ad-
vantage of the new U.S. tax system. 
Tax reform made signature strides to 
address inversions, foreign takeovers of 
U.S. companies, and base erosion. You 
will remember the outrage we had be-
fore the tax bill when there were inver-
sions and foreign takeovers of U.S. 
companies, and then the result of the 
erosion of our tax base. 
Together, the lower tax rate and new 
international rules have changed the 
way that companies structure their 
business 
operations. 
For 
example, 
Assurant, a global insurance company, 
changed its acquisition agreement so 
that its new parent company remains 
here in the United States. 
Broadcom, a technology firm, an-
nounced that it would return its head-
quarters to the United States, and this 
came after tax reform. 
Similarly, several energy and phar-
maceutical companies that had pre-
viously moved out of the United States 
also made the decision to return, pri-
marily because of tax reform. 
You know, the old, old saying can 
apply to this tax legislation. What we 
wanted to accomplish was accom-
plished, and that old saying is: The 
proof is in the pudding. 
So tax reform has leveled the playing 
field and made the United States a far 
more attractive place to do business— 
hardly the dire consequences that crit-
ics would have us believe. Now, you 
know critics never give up. Not to be 
deterred, the critics continue to look 
for misleading information to distort 
the picture. 
Most recently, they pointed to the 
Congressional Budget Office projec-
tions as evidence that tax reform and 
recently issued U.S. Treasury Depart-
ment regulations have provided a wind-
fall to corporations. I hate to see the 
Congressional Budget Office’s profes-
sional work and nonpartisan work ma-
nipulated to say something it clearly 
does not—and I meant to use the word 
‘‘manipulated.’’ 
First and foremost, CBO’s—that is 
the 
Congressional 
Budget 
Office— 
downward adjustment of expected cor-
porate tax receipts does not imply that 
CBO scores particular Treasury regula-
tions or that a regulation departs from 
congressional intent. Rather, CBO’s ad-
justments broadly reflect significant 
economic factors and changes in gov-
ernment data. 
In particular, CBO adjusted its pro-
jections because we now know that Bu-
reau of Economic Analysis estimates of 
corporate receipts between 2016 and 
2018 were actually overstated. So you 
have to make adjustments for that. In 
short, even pretax reform projections 
of corporate profits were really too 
high. So when the estimate of cor-
porate profits is corrected, it trans-
lates into lower tax receipts, but the 
other side doesn’t seem to acknowledge 
this. 
CBO also took into account current 
economic factors, like recent trade ac-
tions and tariffs, strengthening of the 
U.S. dollar, and the softening of foreign 
economies, all of which affected ex-
pected corporate profits and ultimate 
tax receipts. But our critics don’t seem 
to acknowledge that fact. 
In addition, the Congressional Budg-
et Office revised its projections to re-
flect everything that we are learning 
about implementation of the new tax 
rules, including regulatory guidance, 
new forms and instructions that go 
with the tax forms, and modeling im-
provements to better reflect updated 
economic projections. 
CBO is only beginning to take into 
account how U.S. businesses are re-
sponding very positively to the new tax 
rules and Treasury guidance. 
As many regulations are still being 
finalized, businesses are only starting 
to have needed certainty to invest in 
new property and equipment, to engage 
in mergers and acquisitions, and to 
enter into new business transactions. 
The Congressional Budget Office’s 
projections are also based upon pre-
liminary data. Tax returns for the first 
year of the new law were filed less than 
6 months ago, but the critics don’t 
take that into consideration. The final 
data will not be available from the IRS 
until later this year, and, even then, it 
will still take time to fully analyze, 
but our critics don’t recognize that. 
All of these factors go into CBO’s re-
vised projections of corporate tax re-
ceipts, and none of them support the 
claim that Treasury provided a wind-
fall to corporations. I think the critics 
ought to go the extra mile to study and 
understand the impact of the tax cut 
law. 
There simply is no basis, then, for 
the critics’ claim that the revision to 
CBO’s estimate of corporate receipts 
means that Treasury has given away 
the store to big corporations through 
its regulations. 
Despite the critics’ relentless at-
tacks, the benefits of tax reform are, in 
fact, proving out. All you have to do is 
look at the good economy to know that 
that is the case. 
I am encouraged by the promising 
economic data that I just referred to 
that suggests that American workers, 
American families, and American busi-
nesses are seeing positive effects. 
Now, we must continue to promote 
policies that encourage U.S. businesses 
to keep operations on American soil— 
the 
2017 
bill 
does 
that—increase 
wages—the 2017 bill did that—and rein-
vest foreign earnings in the United 
States, instead of leaving them over-
seas—and the 2017 tax bill does that. 
I hope that my Democratic col-
leagues will stop criticizing the poli-
cies that have strengthened our econ-
omy and, in fact, consider how we can 
work together to make our tax laws 
work even better for American busi-
nesses and workers. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here again, as the Senate returns to 
regular business, to call us again to re-
spond to the threat of climate change. 
Here on the floor today, things seem 
back to normal. The floor is empty. We 
have a Senator instead of a Chief Jus-
tice in the chair. The quorum calls de-
scend between the speeches. Our new 
pages are figuring out the nonimpeach-
ment routines of the floor. 
Outside of the Senate, things are 
anything but normal. The threat of cli-
mate change worsens by the minute. 
Carbon emissions continue to rise glob-
ally. We hurtle toward calamity. Yet 
we do not act. What is stopping us? The 
biggest, most powerful, most moti-
vated force preventing climate action 
is the fossil fuel industry, and, of 
course, it would be. The fossil fuel in-
dustry reaps the biggest subsidy in the 
history of the planet. The Inter-
national Monetary Fund estimates the 
global subsidy for fossil fuel in the tril-
lions of dollars every year. In the 
United States alone, the fossil fuel in-
dustry got a $650 billion subsidy in 2015, 
according to the most recent report 
from the IMF. That is about $2,000 from 
every woman, man, and child in the 
country. 
You wrote the check, and they will 
spend big bucks to defend that subsidy. 
In fact, to maintain their grip on that 
subsidy, fossil fuel companies deploy 
lots of propaganda on the American 
people. They swamp us in advertising. 
The game isn’t just to sell you more 
gas. It is much bigger than that. 
Professor Robert Brulle of Drexel 
University—now in Rhode Island at 
Brown University—together with his 
coauthors, wrote a recent article, ‘‘Cor-
porate 
Promotion 
and 
Climate 
Change,’’ looking at oil companies’ 
carefully crafted public relations cam-
paigns deployed way back since leg-
endary muckraker Ida Tarbell chron-
icled the greed and cruelty of the 
Standard Oil Company. To offset their 
reputation for greed and nastiness, 
‘‘fossil fuel companies have attempted 
to burnish their image in various 
ways,’’ Brulle and his colleagues write, 
‘‘[including] contemporary multimedia 
promotional campaigns . . . to project 
the corporation as a positive, respon-
sible, and legitimate social actor.’’ 
Hah. 
The public began to catch on to the 
harms of industrial pollution in the 
1960s and 1970s, and Big Oil deployed 
public relations campaigns to stem the 
public opinion tide. 
One example Brulle uses is Mobil Oil, 
pre-ExxonMobil merger. In 1970, Mobil 
began buying space on the opinion page 
of the New York Times. They called 
these things advertorials—not adver-
tisements, 
not 
editorials, 
but

advertorials. They ran in the same sec-
tion as real opinion pieces. Every 
Thursday, those ads promoted Mobil’s 
image as a good corporate citizen and 
boosted its public policy priorities, like 
reduced regulation of Mobil’s oper-
ations. Meanwhile, Mobil worked hard 
to place rosy ‘‘earned media’’ stories 
on airwaves and in print. ‘‘Between 1975 
and 1977 alone, Mobil representatives 
appeared on 365 TV shows, 211 radio 
shows, and gave 80 newspaper inter-
views,’’ the study authors observe. 
I will pause to note some good news, 
which is that, just recently, The 
Guardian announced that it will no 
longer accept advertising that props up 
fossil fuels like oil and coal. The 
Guardian urged its colleagues in the 
media to do the same. Acting chief ex-
ecutive Anna Bateson and chief rev-
enue officer Hamish Nicklin said in a 
statement: ‘‘Our decision is based on 
the decades-long efforts by many in 
that industry to prevent meaningful 
climate action by governments around 
the world.’’ 
Welcome to our experience here in 
the Congress. As we have seen here in 
the Congress, the fossil industry com-
panies have done that with dark 
money, they have done that with raw 
political muscle, they have done that 
through fake science, and they have 
done it through advertising campaigns. 
So bravo to The Guardian for shutting 
off that spigot of fossil fuel nonsense. I 
hope American media outlets follow 
suit. 
Dr. Brulle then turns to recent dec-
ades. Using spending figures from 1986 
to 2015, he and his scientists find that 
corporate promotional spending for the 
five major oil companies in the United 
States—ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron- 
Texaco, BP, and ConocoPhillips—to-
taled nearly $3.6 billion. That is an av-
erage of $120 million per year, and the 
trend is upward. 
After $35 million in spending in 1996, 
from 1997 to 2004, annual spending rose 
to an average of $102 million per year. 
Then Brulle and his team chronicled 
that spending averages leaped again be-
tween 2008 and 2016 to an average of 
$217 million per year. 
These spending figures themselves 
are pretty eye-popping, but what is im-
portant here is the patterns of spend-
ing. Brulle and his coauthors write: 
The bulk of this spending . . . corresponds 
to the increased public and congressional at-
tention to climate change in recent years. 
Not unexpectedly, the major oil companies 
spent $315 million in 2010 alone, which is 
when the highest possibility of binding cli-
mate legislation occurred. 
That is no coincidence. Here in this 
building, something was occurring that 
the fossil fuel industry saw as a threat. 
Brulle and his colleagues continue: 
This high level of corporate promotional 
spending took place in response to the legis-
lative battle from 2009 to 2010 over the House 
of Representatives’ passage of the Waxman- 
Markey climate bill and the subsequent Sen-
ate consideration of the Kerry-Lieberman 
climate legislation. 
This pattern shows Big Oil’s purpose: 
to block climate action in Congress. 
While we are talking about that pe-
riod, right over there in the Supreme 
Court, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
and others, on behalf of their Big Oil 
funders, urged the Supreme Court to 
open up our politics to unlimited spe-
cial interest spending, and the five Re-
publican Justices on that Court, led by 
Chief Justice Roberts, did. From that 
decision forward, we have seen a dis-
aster in the Senate on climate legisla-
tion. Before that decision, we had four 
or five bipartisan climate bills going in 
the Senate at any given time. We had 
a Republican candidate for President— 
John 
McCain—who 
campaigned 
for 
President on a strong climate plat-
form. But right after that decision 
came out, right after the fossil fuel in-
dustry got handed that huge new ham-
mer to knock any dissent on climate 
out of the Republican Party, they did 
so. We have had a lost decade since 
then. So it is not just their advertising, 
but their PR spending certainly helped 
the fossil fuel industry block the Wax-
man-Markey bill and obstructed efforts 
since to solve the climate crisis. 
Another study by Professor Brulle 
just last month chronicled the full 
sweep of this industry’s fight against 
climate legislation. Brulle describes 
how this polluting industry used ads, 
webs of phony front groups, bogus 
science, and that massive Citizens 
United political and PR artillery to 
fend off any meaningful action by Con-
gress. 
Professor Brulle breaks this process 
down to its component parts; one, 
shaping the direction of research ef-
forts into nonthreatening areas; two, 
concealing 
information 
about 
the 
harmful aspects of a corporate product; 
three, attacking scientific findings and 
the scientists who produce research 
that 
threatens 
corporate 
interests; 
four, packaging their own carefully 
constructed 
interpretations 
of 
the 
science to appear legitimate; and, five, 
aggressive 
efforts 
at 
spinning 
the 
media to promulgate favorable press. 
A typical example of the first tactic 
is oil company ads touting research 
and investments in alternative low- 
carbon fuels or renewable energy. For 
instance, we have seen ExxonMobil ads 
touting ExxonMobil’s research into 
algae biofuels, and we have seen BP ads 
touting renewable energy under its 
label ‘‘Beyond Petroleum.’’ ‘‘Badly Pol-
luting’’ would be a better term. 
So how much do these renewable in-
vestments 
represent? 
According 
to 
Reuters, Exxon will spend roughly $30 
billion this year—$30 billion this year— 
in 
capital 
expenditures. 
That 
is 
Exxon’s capital budget. Investments in 
green technologies round to zero per-
cent of Exxon’s 2020 capital expendi-
tures. You see the ads, but that invest-
ment, they call it, rounds to zero per-
cent of ExxonMobil’s capital invest-
ments. 
BP will spend more than $15 billion 
in capital expenditures. Its renewable 
energy investments is 3 percent—3 per-
cent—of that. 
I challenge Exxon to disprove that it 
spent more on advertisements touting 
its renewable investments than it does 
on the renewable investments them-
selves. These investments are a prop 
for an advertising campaign, like the 
Potemkin villages that were built for 
the czar when he was taken out of Mos-
cow to go see how happy the peasants 
were, and they built phony villages 
near the railroad with dressed-up peas-
ants to dance and wave at the czar so 
he wouldn’t know that revolution was 
coming and that fury and anger raged 
through his country. This is a TV 
version of a Potemkin village. 
You go through National Airport 
right now, you will see the most foul 
nonsense up on the walls of that air-
port designed to convince people pass-
ing through National Airport at our 
Nation’s Capital that these companies 
are responsible about climate change. 
People walking in forests looking nat-
ural, the phony-baloney investments 
designed to prop up ad campaigns, they 
are immense in the PR space. You can 
see why the Guardian will not take 
this poison any longer. 
For decades, these ads blared these 
phony articles at the newspapers. Their 
paid-for pundits populated the talk 
shows, just as the fossil fuel companies 
polluted 
our 
atmosphere 
and 
our 
oceans. While they did this, they knew 
better than anyone what they were 
causing. 
Back in 1982, Exxon projected that by 
2019, atmospheric CO2 would reach be-
tween 390 and 420 parts per million. 
Sure enough, as 2019 drew to a close, 
guess where carbon dioxide in our at-
mosphere was. It had just crossed 410 
parts per million. They predicted this, 
and they were right. But instead of act-
ing on what they knew, they rammed 
all this public relations nonsense—this 
has been the atmospheric carbon diox-
ide climb. But instead of reacting to 
this in a responsible way and trying to 
really do something with renewable 
fuels, they did fake renewable invest-
ments to prop up advertising cam-
paigns to convince the public that they 
were on it. These are the phrases right 
now from the American Petroleum In-
stitute: We are on it. Don’t worry. 
Don’t get mad. Don’t get involved. We 
are on it. 
And then they shower this body with 
money and with threats, powered up by 
Citizens United from the five Repub-
lican judges across the street there. 
Not only did Big Oil correctly model 
this increase in CO2 in our atmosphere 
that their product would cause, they 
also understood what this meant. They 
predicted 
the 
hotter 
temperatures. 
They predicted the melting ice sheets. 
They predicted the rising seas that 
Louisiana and Rhode Island are so 
menaced by. They predicted the mas-
sive damage that climate change would 
cause. Exxon knew its business was ul-
timately toxic to our planet. And the 
Exxon CEO who led them through this, 
the craftsman and CEO of so many of 
these campaigns of lies, now sits hap-
pily on the board of J.P. Morgan—J.P.

Morgan which claims to be seriously 
and sincerely interested in climate re-
sponse. J.P. Morgan, a major investor 
that has been warned over and over 
again by now more than 30 sovereign 
banks of the danger of an economic 
crash from this carbon bubble pop-
ping—they give the man who led this 
campaign of lies sanctuary and fees on 
their board. 
So what is the purpose of spending 
all that money? The reason Big Oil 
spends billions on its ads is to implant 
favorable perceptions of fossil fuels 
into what Robert Brulle calls the ‘‘col-
lective unconscious,’’ and it does that 
to support its other great influence 
project, which is spending hundreds of 
millions of dollars on lobbying and on 
elections to control the politics of cli-
mate change and to ensure that Repub-
licans block any serious efforts to 
limit carbon pollution. That is a 
scheme that deserves infamy, and it is 
a scheme being perpetrated as I speak, 
right now, today. 
Right now, the American Petroleum 
Institute—the largest trade association 
for the oil and gas industry—has a 
seven-figure ad campaign called ‘‘We’re 
On It.’’ They run ads on the internet, 
on TV, and on billboards—the ones I 
mentioned all over the DC airport—de-
signed to fool the public and policy-
makers that the oil and gas industry is 
‘‘on its’’ carbon and methane emissions 
problem. Not only are they not on it, 
they are cheating about even reporting 
their methane leaks. 
This is an ad in the Washington 
Post’s ‘‘Energy 202’’ newsletter just 
last week. It reads: ‘‘Let’s create cli-
mate 
solutions 
together.’’ 
Content 
from the API. 
Seriously? What a joke. API, the 
same trade association that is furi-
ously lobbying against efforts to con-
trol methane pollution from oil and gas 
facilities don’t even want to report it 
fairly. When Trump got in, job one was 
to take down the methane leakage re-
porting regulation that was coming. 
They are lobbying for expansion of off-
shore drilling, and they are lobbying 
against any price on carbon to offset 
that $650 billion subsidy, and they want 
to create climate solutions together? It 
is unreal—unreal. 
Let’s take a walk back into history. 
In 2006, here in Washington, in the U.S. 
district court, a judge named Gladys 
Kessler wrote a long, long opinion— 
well over 100 pages. It was a com-
manding opinion, and it was an opinion 
that was upheld afterward by the U.S. 
court of appeals. It was an opinion in 
relation to a case that had been 
brought by the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice. 
The U.S. Department of Justice had 
sued the tobacco industry, and they 
had asked Judge Kessler to find the to-
bacco companies’ PR efforts fraudulent 
and to order them to knock it off. They 
were committing fraud. Stop it. You 
are lying to people, enough already. 
In her opinion, Judge Kessler found 
in favor of the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice. Indeed, she found the tobacco 
companies’ fraudulent PR campaigns 
to have amounted to racketeering. It 
was a civil racketeering lawsuit. I will 
quote her decision here. She said the 
tobacco industry ‘‘coordinated signifi-
cant aspects of their public relations, 
scientific, legal, and marketing activ-
ity in furtherance of a shared objec-
tive—to . . . maximize industry profits 
by preserving and expanding the mar-
ket for cigarettes through a scheme to 
deceive the public.’’ 
So swap out ‘‘cigarettes’’ and plug in 
‘‘fossil fuel,’’ and you have described 
exactly what big oil companies do: co-
ordinate their public relations, sci-
entific, legal, and marketing activity 
in furtherance of a shared objective to 
maximize industry profits by pre-
serving and expanding the market for 
fossil fuel through a scheme to deceive 
the public. 
What the fossil fuel industry is doing 
is precisely the conduct that was rack-
eteering activity when done by the to-
bacco industry, but don’t expect Bill 
Barr’s Department of Justice to pursue 
any type of legal action like that. The 
fossil fuel industry is too strong, and 
the fix is too far in. 
This is all rotten stuff. It is gross. It 
is banana republic behavior. It is not 
what we expect here in the United 
States of America. 
It is on us. It doesn’t have to be this 
way. We can stop it. We have the power 
here in the Senate to shake off the ma-
lign influence of a desperate and 
greedy industry and actually tackle 
the defining issue of our time, like 
Americans should. 
So let’s have a real debate on a real 
climate change bill. Let’s surprise the 
world and pass something big and bold. 
Let’s wake up to the threat of climate 
change and get ahead of its con-
sequences before the situation becomes 
irretrievable. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Alaska. 
NOMINATION OF JOSHUA M. KINDRED 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I have come to the floor this evening to 
speak in support of the nomination of 
Joshua Kindred to be a U.S. district 
court judge for the District of Alaska. 
We were able to move forward with the 
first step toward the confirmation of 
Mr. Kindred, but I just wanted to take 
a couple of minutes and speak as to 
why I believe he is well qualified to 
serve in this capacity and deserves to 
be confirmed by the Senate with, hope-
fully, broad bipartisan support. 
I am glad and I am pleased that he 
has been willing to step into a new role 
for our State. Josh Kindred comes from 
Anchorage, where I am living. He cur-
rently serves as Alaska’s regional so-
licitor for the Department of the Inte-
rior. He has been doing a good job, a 
strong job, for us there. Before joining 
the Department, Mr. Kindred served as 
the environmental counsel for the 
Alaska Oil and Gas Association, as well 
as an assistant district attorney and 
violent unit supervisor for the State of 
Alaska. He also served as a law clerk to 
Chief Justice Paul De Muniz of the Su-
preme Court of the State of Oregon. 
One way that you know that Mr. Kin-
dred has good judgment is that he went 
to the same law school I did. So it 
can’t be all bad there. He earned his 
juris doctorate from Willamette Uni-
versity College of Law. He served as 
editor in chief of the Willamette Law 
Review and certainly demonstrated 
great skills and abilities at that level. 
I think it is important to speak to 
Mr. Kindred’s biographical details to 
illustrate that his experience is both 
considerable and is really relevant. It 
is directly relevant for this new role 
that he is seeking. It is that experience 
in a host of different areas that mat-
ters for our State, and I believe that 
will help him as a Federal jurist. 
Mr. Kindred’s experience in civil, 
criminal, and administrative law at 
both the State and the Federal levels, 
in both the public sector as well as the 
private sector, is exactly what we 
should be seeking in a nominee for a 
court of original jurisdiction, such as 
the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Alaska. 
Josh Kindred is no stranger to the 
courtroom. He has extensive trial expe-
rience, which is, of course, important 
for operating in the courtroom. His 
background also brings a welcomed and 
valuable 
understanding 
of 
Alaska’s 
unique Federal laws and landscape. He 
has extensive experience in Federal 
lands, mining, natural resources, oil 
and gas laws, and environmental laws 
and permitting. These are all things— 
all things—that are constantly liti-
gated back home and that apply to so 
many of the important priorities that 
we have in Alaska. 
You often hear me talk about the 
fact that Alaska is different. It is 
unique, and, certainly, some of our 
laws—many of our laws—reflect that. 
Not many are truly knowledgeable 
about ANCSA, about ANILCA. These 
are critically important to understand, 
and Mr. Kindred certainly understands 
them. That skill set, that operational 
base of knowledge on Alaska-specific 
laws and matters, is really vital for our 
State. 
In addition, and perhaps of equal im-
portance, Mr. Kindred has long called 
Alaska home. He was raised in our 
local schools. He is raising his young 
family there. He comes from good fam-
ily. He married into good family. He is 
a good Alaskan. He knows Alaska. He 
understands our State well. 
I am proud of Mr. Kindred’s contin-
ued commitment to public service and 
his willingness to serve our State. So, 
again, I would urge the Senate to con-
firm Josh Kindred. I know that he will 
do well in his new role, as he has done 
in all his others. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f 
BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND 
CHECKS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
every day, we are reminded of the dev-
astating toll of gun violence in our Na-
tion. On average, around 100 Americans 
die each day from gunfire. It is an epi-
demic of violence. This week marks the 
anniversaries of three horrific mass 
shootings. 
On February 15, 1 year ago, a gunman 
shot and killed five coworkers at a 
warehouse in Aurora, IL, and also shot 
and wounded five police officers who 
rushed to the scene. On that day, we 
lost Russell Beyer, Vicente Juarez, 
Clay Parks, Josh Pinkard, and Trevor 
Wehner. 
February 14 was the date of the 2008 
mass school shooting at Northern Illi-
nois University in DeKalb, in which a 
mentally disturbed gunman killed 5 
students and wounded 17 more. On that 
day, we lost Gayle Dubowski, Catalina 
Garcia, 
Julianna 
Gehant, 
Ryanne 
Mace, and Daniel Parmenter. 
And February 14 was also the date 
when 17 students and staff were mur-
dered in 2018 at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. 
These anniversaries and statistics 
are grim, but they do not capture the 
true impact of this horrific gun vio-
lence—so many funerals, so many fami-
lies and communities devastated. 
And every day we lose still more 
lives to gun violence in communities 
large and small. Just this past week-
end, at least 23 people were shot in the 
city of Chicago, nine of them fatally. 
We pray for the families and loved 
ones of those we have lost, and we re-
member the wounded who bear phys-
ical and mental scars from their trau-
ma. We also renew our thanks for the 
first responders who run toward the 
sound of gunfire and risk their lives to 
help others. 
There are many people throughout 
America who are doing all they can to 
try to reduce our Nation’s epidemic of 
gun violence. This includes parents, 
community 
leaders, 
teachers, 
faith 
leaders, law enforcement, public offi-
cials, the medical community, and 
more. 
I particularly want to commend a co-
alition of hospitals that has been work-
ing with me in Chicago on the HEAL 
Initiative. This is an effort to coordi-
nate these hospitals’ resources, from 
economic investment to community 
programming, to help reduce violence 
and improve quality of life in their sur-
rounding 
neighborhoods. 
There 
are 
promising efforts taking place in many 
States and local communities to ad-
dress gun violence. 
But is the U.S. Senate doing all it 
can to protect our communities from 
gun violence? No, not even close. 
While there is no single reform that 
could prevent every shooting, we know 
there are obvious gaps in Federal gun 
laws that make it easy for felons, abus-
ers, and mentally unstable people to 
get guns. 
Nearly a year ago, on February 27, 
2019, the House of Representatives 
passed a bipartisan bill to close gaps in 
our background check system that 
allow an estimated 22 percent of gun 
sales to occur without a check. Around 
90 percent of Americans support clos-
ing the gaps in the background check 
system. It is a step that would save 
lives. Yet the Republican Senate ma-
jority refuses to call the bill up for a 
vote. I can’t explain why Senate Re-
publicans won’t take up bipartisan, 
House-passed gun safety legislation 
that Americans overwhelmingly sup-
port. It makes no sense. 
There have been too many deaths, 
too many mass shootings, too many 
grim anniversaries, and too many ex-
cuses for inaction. It is time for Sen-
ator MCCONNELL to call up H.R. 8, the 
bipartisan background checks bill, and 
hold a vote. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. LARRY GOODMAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Chicago area is blessed to have some of 
the top hospitals and academic centers 
in the country. Rush University Med-
ical Center and College in Chicago, in 
particular, has advanced into a com-
prehensive and leading health care in-
stitution. Rush continues to deliver 
high-quality care to its patients, driv-
ing the field of innovative medical re-
search and training the next genera-
tion of healthcare practitioners. I 
would like to celebrate the tenure and 
accomplishments 
of 
the 
hospital’s 
president and CEO and the leader in 
the program at Rush, my friend, Dr. 
Larry Goodman. 
In 1976, Larry earned his medical de-
gree from the University of Michigan’s 
Medical School. He completed his resi-
dency at the Rush University Medical 
Center, where he served as the chief 
medical resident before joining the fac-
ulty. 
At Rush, Larry served as an infec-
tious disease specialist, working to im-
prove the lives of people affected by 
HIV and AIDS. He also served as the 
senior vice president of medical affairs 
and the dean of the Rush Medical Col-
lege before the hospital appointed him 
as it’s president and CEO in 2002. 
Under Larry’s leadership, Rush has 
prospered. The hospital doubled its stu-
dent enrollment in the last 20 years, 
training future physicians who will 
provide top-notch healthcare services 
in communities around the Nation. The 
hospital also collaborated to increase 
its employment of local community 
members. 
These 
efforts, 
in 
part 
through West Side United, have helped 
to reduce the health inequities that 
exist between the residents of low-in-
come communities and those in afflu-
ent communities. In fact, it was Dr. 
Goodman who first told me about the 
alarming 16-year gap in life expectancy 
between people living in the Loop and 
in West Garfield Park—just two ‘‘L’’ 
stops, or 6 miles, apart from each other 
on the Blue. 
More than a year ago, I joined sev-

causes of gun violence, such as eco-
nomic 
hardship 
and 
spare 
mental 
health services. Under this initiative, 
each hospital made 16 commitments to 
address these issues. Larry was the in-
spiration for this undertaking and in-
strumental in getting it off the ground. 
It is a testament to his lifelong dedica-
tion to those in need. 
After decades of service dedicated to 
improving lives and helping others, 
Larry has retired with an amazing leg-
acy. He has been key to thinking about 
the transformative role of hospitals in 
uplifting communities and through his 
hard work, vision, and commitment to 
make it possible. I am especially grate-
ful for our partnership over the years, 
from his leadership on the Cook Coun-
ty Hospital transition to the Chicago 
HEAL Initiative. 
I am proud to call Larry my friend, 
and I wish him the very best in retire-
ment.

TRIBUTE TO PATRICK MAGOON 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was more than 50 years ago that a 
young couple from Springfield, IL 
brought their baby daughter to then- 
Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chi-
cago. They drove more than 200 miles 
each way because they knew Children’s 
Hospital provided the best care for 
their daughter, and they repeated that 
trip every 3 months for years. I know 
this story well because it is the story 
of my family’s relationship with Chil-
dren’s Memorial, now known as Lurie 
Children’s. It also is a story thousands 
of other children and families could 
tell about the world-class treatment 
they received at Children’s. 
I want to take this time to recognize 
a person who has been the heart and 
soul of this hospital for decades: my 
friend, Mr. Patrick Magoon. Pat served 
as the president and CEO of the Ann 
and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hos-
pital of Chicago for more than two dec-
ades. He retired recently, and I want to 
take this opportunity to honor his 
work. 
In 1977, Pat started his career at 
then-Children’s Memorial Hospital as a 
planning department intern while he 
pursued his master’s degree in urban 
policy and planning from the Univer-
sity of Illinois. When he joined the 
staff at the hospital, he held a number 
of 
administrative 
positions—even 
working as the hospital’s laundry man-
ager—before he became president and 
CEO in 1997. 
In the last 20 years under Pat’s direc-
tion, Lurie Children’s has come to be 
recognized as one of the best children’s 
hospitals in the Nation. In the last 8 
years, U.S. News and World Report has 
named Lurie’s a top 10 children’s hos-
pital in the country 7 times. It also has 
received four Magnet Award designa-
tions, the highest national recognition 
given for excellence in nursing care. 
When Pat was appointed, the hospital 
faced financial challenges, losing about 
$1 million a month. Thanks to his hard 
work, vision, and commitment, the 
hospital is not only financially stable 
but has become a beacon of hope for 
children—both within its own walls 
and in the Chicago community. During 
Pat’s tenure, it has increased the num-
ber of children it serves by more than 
50 percent, giving thousands of children 
access to high-quality healthcare serv-
ices. Lurie Children’s has significantly 
expanded its innovative research and 
treatment services, including its Na-
tion-leading 
efforts 
on 
trauma-in-
formed care and violence prevention, 
to meet the increasing needs of its pa-
tients. 
Pat Magoon has been the key to posi-
tioning Lurie Children’s as a national 
leader in the care of kids. I am espe-
cially grateful for our partnership over 
the years and his leadership in pro-
tecting and advocating for the young-
est, most vulnerable patients. We could 
always count on Pat and Children’s to 
be a strong ally in the support of the 
Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, bio-
medical research funding, and address-
ing violence and the social deter-
minants of health. 
Pat Magoon’s legacy is not just a 
great children’s hospital, which Lurie 
Children’s has become, but the heart-
felt appreciation of the children, par-
ents, staff, and volunteers who know he 
has been an integral part of making 
their lives better. I salute my friend, 
Pat Magoon. 
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the 
following statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.) 
f 
HONEST ADS ACT 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
it has been 1190 days since Russia at-
tacked us in 2016, and we have yet to 
pass comprehensive election security 
reform. The next major elections are 
just 266 days away and primaries are 
already underway. We must take ac-
tion now to secure our elections from 
foreign threats. I applaud my Demo-
cratic colleagues for coming to the 
floor today to urge the Senate to take 
action. 
Our intelligence officials have re-
peatedly warned that elections remain 
a target for foreign adversaries and 
that our election systems remain vul-
nerable. According to a recent joint 
statement from our military and intel-
ligence agencies, the administration 
warned that ‘‘Russia, China, Iran and 
other foreign malicious actors will 
seek to interfere in the voting process 
or influence voter perceptions.’’ Our 
adversaries are emboldened, and we 
must do more to safeguard our elec-
tions. 
I have been coming to the floor for 
years now fighting to get comprehen-
sive 
election 
security 
legislation 
passed because election security is na-
tional security. While we have made 
progress and secured nearly $1 billion 
in election security grants for States, 
we have been blocked from passing 
meaningful legislation that would en-
sure our election systems are resilient 
in the face of attacks, legislation that 
calls for paper ballots and reliable 
postelection 
audits—basic 
require-
ments that would dramatically im-
prove election security. Despite my bi-
partisan work with Senator LANKFORD 
on such legislation, we have been re-
peatedly blocked from bringing it to 
the floor. 
There are other commonsense bipar-
tisan election security bills that have 
been blocked from the floor. Late last 
year, I pushed the Senate to take ac-
tion on the Honest Ads Act, my bipar-
tisan legislation with Senator GRAHAM 
that would increase transparency and 
accountability for political ads sold on-
line. The goal is simple: bring our laws 
into the 21st century to ensure that 
voters know who is paying to influence 
our political system. That is a goal 
every elected official should be fighting 
for, but I was again blocked from offer-
ing the legislation on the Senate floor. 
We have a common set of facts about 
how our elections were attacked; now 
we must act with a common purpose to 
ensure it never happens again. This is 
about our democracy, not about par-
tisanship. The freedom to choose our 
leaders and know with full confidence 
that those leaders were chosen in free 
and fair elections is something Ameri-
cans have fought and died for since our 
country was founded. We need to be a 
united front in fighting against those 
who interfere with our political sys-
tem, and we must do everything in our 
power to protect our elections.∑

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
BIGHORN SHEEP RETURN TO FORT 
BERTHOLD RESERVATION 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, it 
has been 150 years since bighorn sheep 
have roamed the Tribal lands of the 
Fort Berthold Reservation in north-
western North Dakota. At the end of 
January, the sheep returned. 
Their re-introduction to lands they 
had inhabited for centuries was a long- 
held goal of many tribal leaders and 
state 
wildlife 
professionals. 
Their 
dream was realized when the Mandan 
Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and the 
North Dakota Game and Fish Depart-
ment worked out a cooperative agree-
ment, which they signed last month. 
Thirty bighorn sheep from the Rocky 
Boy Reservation in north central Mon-
tana were brought to Fort Berthold 
and released near Mandaree and Twin 
Buttes on reservation habitat known 
to be ideal for the sheep. Their man-
agement 
and 
maintenance 
will 
be 
shared between the state and tribe. 
The rarest big game species in my 
state, bighorn sheep are found only on 
steep terrain near the North Dakota 
Badlands. With these new sheep, their 
total population in the state is now ap-
proximately 360. 
Bighorn sheep are historically sig-
nificant to the Mandan Hidatsa and

Arikara Nation. Hunted with bow and 
arrows and used in traditional cere-
monies for years, they were recorded as 
being seen in what is present-day 
North Dakota in scientific journals of 
the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804– 
1806. Paintings by well-known artists 
like Karl Bodmer depict tribal chiefs, 
including the prominent Mandan Chief 
Four Bears, wearing their valued hides. 
The return of the bighorn sheep to 
native habitat honors the past and en-
riches the future of the residents of 
Fort Berthold. It is a remarkable ex-
ample of the profound impact a col-
laboration of like minds can have on a 
mutual goal. 
I have long admired the rugged beau-
ty of the bighorn sheep and am among 
many North Dakotans who appreciate 
their historical significance in my 
state. I applaud all who had the vision 
to bring the bighorn sheep back to the 
Fort Berthold Reservation and wish 
them every success in ensuring they 
thrive in this new habitat.∑

RECOGNIZING OAKES CUSTOM 
MEATS & CATERING 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit, which drives our econ-
omy. This week, it is my pleasure to 
honor Oakes Custom Meats & Catering 
of Chumuckla, FL, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
For more than 25 years, Oakes Cus-
tom Meats & Catering has served 
Chumuckla as a neighborhood butcher 
shop that cuts and processes livestock 
and wild game. Having lived and 
worked in Chumuckla for generations, 
the Oakes family is uniquely posi-
tioned to serve their community in 
this capacity, as they deeply appre-
ciate their local farmers and under-
stand their needs. The Oakes’ knowl-
edge of and friendships with the people 
in their community allows them to 
serve their community well, providing 
exceptional 
personalized 
service 
to 
every customer. 
Oakes Custom Meats & Catering of-
fers personalized services in a number 
of ways, including full-service catering 
for parties, celebrations, and corporate 
events. They also have a food truck 
that serves lunch several days a week 
at various locations inhabited by local 
small businesses around Chumuckla, 
helping to promote those businesses in 
the 
community. 
The 
food 
truck 
lunches have a large following on so-
cial media, are extremely popular, and 
often sell out within a few hours. 
Oakes Custom Meats & Catering’s rave 
reviews reflect not only their delicious 
food, but their high-quality customer 
service as well. 
Oakes Custom Meats & Catering is 
also present in their community in a 
charitable capacity. They sponsor a 
weekly event hosted by a local fitness 
company, provide meals for fundraising 
volunteers, and position their food 
truck at different charity events. They 
also bring joy to those in their commu-
nity by giving away free lunches and 
meals. As one of the long-serving busi-
nesses in the small community of 
Chumuckla, FL, Oakes Custom Meats 
& Catering has cemented itself as a 
staple in the area for its high-quality 
meat processing service, delicious ca-
tered food, and dedication to serving 
its farming community. Congratula-
tions to the entire Oakes Custom 
Meats & Catering team for being 
named Senate Small Business of the 
Week. I look forward to watching your 
continued growth and success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. YOUNG): 
S. 3273. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to establish a 
community college and career training 
grant program; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, approxi-
mately 80 percent of jobs in today’s 
workforce require some form of post-
secondary education or training be-
yond the high school level. While the 
number of students pursing postsec-
ondary education is growing, the sup-
ply of middle-skilled workers, whose 
work requires more than a high school 
diploma but not a four-year degree, 
falls short of industry demand. Accord-
ing to the National Skills Coalition, 53 
percent of all jobs in today’s labor mar-
ket are middle skill, but only 43 per-
cent of U.S. workers are trained at this 
level. Education is failing to meet the 
needs of critical industries, including 
manufacturing, construction, energy,

health care, information technology, 
transportation, and business manage-
ment and administration. 
For many people seeking a job, at-
tending a community college is the 
most affordable and accessible pathway 
to higher paying employment opportu-
nities. In Virginia, we have 23 commu-
nity colleges that serve an estimated 
400,000 people across the State, pro-
viding them opportunities to earn an 
associate’s degree, certifications or 
licensures in some of the most cutting- 
edge and in-demand fields in our work-
force. The impact of community col-
leges nationwide is even greater, and 
our rapidly changing economy demands 
increased investment in the pathways 
these institutions provide to keep up 
with changing skill demands. 
Today, I am proud to introduce the 
Assisting Community Colleges in Edu-
cating Skilled Students (ACCESS) to 
Careers Act with Senator YOUNG. In-
spired by the success of the Trade Ad-
justment Assistance Community Col-
lege and Career Training grant pro-
gram, this bill provides grants to 
states and community colleges to scale 
evidence-based strategies that will help 
prepare our students with the skills 
necessary to succeed in our in-demand 
industry 
sectors 
and 
occupations. 
These grants can be used to expand 
dual enrollment, work-based learning 
opportunities, 
apprenticeships, 
and 
other pathways to best meet the skill 
needs of students and employers in our 
evolving workforce. The bill also em-
phasizes the importance of student 
services to ensure that students have 
the support they need to complete 
their programs. 
The bill also allows grants to be used 
for developing partnerships between 
community colleges and other private 
and public sector entities, creating in-
novative career pathways directly be-
tween two-year institutions and em-
ployers. In Virginia, we’ve already 
started to see the success of these com-
munity college partnerships as part of 
a strategy to address the growing 
workforce shortages in rural areas and 
in-demand industries. 
When we invest in our community 
colleges, they become hubs of innova-
tion, finding pathways to train our 
next generation in the skills our rap-
idly evolving workforce needs. The AC-
CESS to Careers Act represents a nec-
essary step to take the evidence-based 
innovations we’ve seen on the local 
level to scale in order to fill jobs in 
high-needs industries. I strongly en-
courage my colleagues in the Senate to 
consider this commonsense, bipartisan 
legislation as we move towards reau-
thorizing the Higher Education Act.

NATING FEBRUARY 12, 2020, AS 
‘‘DARWIN 
DAY’’ 
AND 
RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
SCIENCE TO THE BETTERMENT 
OF HUMANITY 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. 
MURPHY, and Mr. WHITEHOUSE) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 495 
Whereas Charles Darwin developed the the-
ory of evolution by natural selection, which 
provides humanity with a logical and intel-
lectually compelling explanation for the di-
versity of life on Earth; 
Whereas the validity of the theory of evo-
lution by natural selection is strongly sup-
ported by the monumental amount of sci-
entific evidence Charles Darwin compiled to 
support the theory and the modern under-
standing of the science of genetics; 
Whereas the human curiosity and inge-
nuity exemplified by Charles Darwin have 
promoted new scientific discoveries that 
have helped humanity solve many problems 
and improve living conditions; 
Whereas the advancement of science must 
be protected from individuals unconcerned 
with the adverse impacts of global warming 
and climate change; 
Whereas the teaching of creationism in 
some public schools compromises the sci-
entific and academic integrity of the edu-
cation systems of the United States; 
Whereas Charles Darwin is a worthy sym-
bol of scientific advancement on whom to 
focus and around whom to build a global 
celebration of science and humanity in-
tended to promote a common bond among all 
the people of the Earth; and 
Whereas February 12, 2020, is the anniver-
sary of the birth of Charles Darwin in 1809 
and is an appropriate date to designate as 
‘‘Darwin Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates February 12, 2020, as ‘‘Darwin 
Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the importance of science to 
the betterment of humanity; and 
(3) recognizes Charles Darwin as a worthy 
symbol for celebrating science, the achieve-
ments of reason, and the advancement of 
human knowledge.

Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mr. 
COONS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 496 
Whereas more than 20,000,000 listeners in 
the United States tune in weekly to local 
public radio stations to discover, learn 
about, and enjoy music selections, artists, 
and genres that are, in many cases, available 
only on public radio; 
Whereas approximately 734 public radio 
music stations serve rural and urban com-
munities in all 50 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
and Guam; 
Whereas public radio music stations— 
(1) are noncommercial, nonprofit, public 
service radio stations; 
(2) are locally staffed and programmed; and 
(3) share the core values of music dis-
covery, curation, preservation, performance, 
and community; 
Whereas public radio music stations cele-
brate a broad collection of sounds and styles, 
including jazz, blues, classical, Americana, 
alternative, folk, roots, bluegrass, and other 
regional and eclectic genres; 
Whereas 97 percent of over-the-air broad-
casts of classical music in the United States 
come from local public radio stations; 
Whereas public radio music stations are an 
essential and indispensable force in— 
(1) sustaining music and performers; 
(2) developing artists and audiences; and 
(3) educating and enriching the commu-
nities in which the stations are located; 
Whereas knowledgeable local hosts, live 
announcers, and expert curation on public 
radio music stations have a proven track 
record of— 
(1) helping audiences discover new and 
emerging musicians; and 
(2) providing deep explorations into the 
history and cultural impact of music; 
Whereas public radio music stations tailor 
their content and programming— 
(1) to reflect regional tastes and talent; 
and 
(2) to make music more accessible through 
local performances, studio sessions, artist 
interviews, music journalism, and local news 
and performance information; 
Whereas public radio music stations offer 
audiences, musicians, and artists numerous 
platforms for innovative music programming 
on air, online, on video, on stage, and on-the- 
go; 
Whereas the emphasis that public radio 
stations place on music presentation enables 
new, emerging, and essential artists to con-
struct deep and lasting relationships with 
audiences, adding to the journey of lifelong 
music enjoyment; 
Whereas public radio music stations serve 
as cultural hubs in the communities in 
which those stations are located by pro-
viding a place for listeners of diverse back-
grounds and ages to come together for the 
shared thrill of music; 
Whereas the commitment of public radio 
to music and education brings the instru-
ments and experience of music to schools, 
hospitals, and other places in the public 
square to ensure wide access to music; 
Whereas the varied and unique activities 
and attributes of public radio music sta-
tions— 
(1) foster community among music lovers; 
(2) build support for local artists and the 
local music economy; and 
(3) develop the next generation of musi-
cians and audiences; 
Whereas the core values of public radio 
music stations and the collective commit-
ment of those stations to community serv-
ice, education, and cultural support sepa-
rates public radio music stations from other 
music providers; and 
Whereas April 16, 2020, would be an appro-
priate day to designate as ‘‘Public Radio 
Music Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of April 16, 
2020, as ‘‘Public Radio Music Day’’; and 
(2) expresses deep appreciation for the role 
of public radio music stations in serving lis-
teners, musicians, and hundreds of commu-
nities across the United States.

gal rumors; 
Whereas Chinese government authorities 
played down dangers to the public for weeks 
as 2019–nCoV continued to spread, with more 
than 42,000 confirmed cases in China alone 
and at least 1,000 deaths reported as of Feb-
ruary 11, 2020; 
Whereas Dr. Li continued to work as an 
ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital 
despite his knowledge of the outbreak, and 
appears to have been infected himself with 
2019–nCoV after coming in contact with a pa-
tient he was treating for glaucoma; 
Whereas, on the morning of February 7, 
2020, in the hospital where he worked, Dr. Li 
Wenliang died after contracting 2019–nCoV; 
Whereas, before he passed away, Dr. Li 
stated, ‘‘If the officials had disclosed infor-
mation about the epidemic earlier, I think it 
would have been a lot better. There should 
be more openness and transparency.’’; 
Whereas the people of China expressed 
their grief and anger on social media after 
the death of Dr. Li, with the phrase ‘‘I want 
freedom of speech’’ emerging as a top 
trending topic on the Weibo platform; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China continues to limit free ex-
pression, and stepped up censorship after on-
line criticism and investigative reports by 
Chinese journalists suggesting that officials 
underestimated and underplayed the threat 
of 2019–nCoV; 
Whereas Freedom House has listed China 
as the ‘‘worst abuser of internet freedom’’ in 
the world for the fourth year in a row, and in 
the aftermath of the outbreak of 2019–nCoV, 
there are numerous and well-documented in-
stances of the ‘‘Great Firewall’’ of China 
suppressing the free flow of critical and 
medically important information about the 
pandemic; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China has endangered the people 
of Taiwan and people around the world by 
using its influence to limit Taiwan’s access 
to the benefits of membership in the World 
Health Organization and the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, particularly 
during the current outbreak; and 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
has declared 2019–nCoV a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the life and contributions of Dr. 
Li Wenliang, and extends heartfelt sympathy 
to his family and to the families of all who 
have passed during this outbreak; 
(2) expresses its support for the people of 
China as they face this unprecedented public 
health challenge; 
(3) expresses gratitude to Dr. Li and all 
Chinese medical personnel and citizens for 
their efforts to spread awareness of 2019– 
nCoV and treat individuals who have con-
tracted the disease; 
(4) calls on the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China and the Communist Party 
of China— 
(A) to be open and transparent in inves-
tigating and responding to 2019–nCoV; 
(B) to ensure that Chinese citizens and the 
international community have free and un-
fettered access, without censorship or social 
media controls, to information about 2019– 
nCoV; 
(C) to cooperate fully with the United 
States Government, including the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, in pro-
viding medical access, sharing information, 
and developing treatment to combat 2019– 
nCoV; 
(D) to cooperate fully with other govern-
ments, especially those in Southeast Asia, 
Africa, Latin America, and other regions 
whose health systems already face high bur-
dens and are operating from a lower base of 
capability, as well as international health 
organizations in combating 2019–nCoV; and 
(E) to cease efforts to exclude Taiwan from 
international organizations, including the 
World Health Organization and the Inter-
national Civil Aviation Organization; 
(5) affirms the vital importance of Dr. Li’s 
belief that ‘‘[t]here should be more openness 
and transparency’’ in China; 
(6) affirms that freedom of expression is a 
social good that enables experts to sound 
public health warnings and helps citizens en-
sure that their government addresses weak-
nesses in crisis response; and 
(7) strongly supports the people of China in 
their demand for freedom of speech.

CONCURRENT 
RESOLU-
TION 
36—SUPPORTING 
THE 
FARMERS BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. 
MERKLEY) submitted the following con-
current resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry: 
S. CON. RES. 36 
Whereas the Center for American Progress 
reported mergers and acquisitions have in-
creased corporate concentration across agri-
cultural markets, including monopolizing 85 
percent market share of the corn seed mar-
ket through the 4 largest firms in the seed 
sector; 
Whereas according to the Open Markets In-
stitute, the excessive concentration in the 
poultry industry has resulted in half of 
chicken farmers working in regions domi-
nated by only 1 or 2 processing monopolies, 
leaving them with little, if any, bargaining 
power for better contracts or growing terms; 
Whereas the Organization for Competitive 
Markets reported cattle prices paid to farm-
ers from 2013 to 2016 dropped by 13 percent, 
while during the same period prices paid for 
beef by consumers at the grocery store in-
creased by 4 percent, leading them to con-
clude that the prices paid to farmers and by 
consumers are not the result of a fair and 
just market; 
Whereas corporate concentration and abu-
sive practices in America’s food and farm 
sector are at detrimental highs, harming 
consumers, rural communities and family 
farmers and ranchers, including historically 
underserved farmers and ranchers, by— 
(1) diminishing the availability of seed 
choice; 
(2) limiting the accessibility of domestic 
farming lands; 
(3) increasing food prices and market ma-
nipulation; and 
(4) 
hindering 
access 
to 
traditional 
foodways and agricultural practices; 
Whereas according to the American Farm 
Bureau Federation, farm loan delinquencies 
are at a 6-year high and have increased over 
the past 24 quarters; 
Whereas increasing farm debt, decreasing 
incomes, and deteriorating overall condi-
tions for family farmers and ranchers have 
caused farm foreclosures and chapter 12 
bankruptcies to steadily increase over the 
past year; 
Whereas, according to the 2019 Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change Special 
Report, agriculture, forestry, and other land 
use activities accounted for 23 percent of net 
global anthropogenic emissions contributing 
to human-induced climate change, which is 
resulting in the ongoing deterioration of 
food systems, including irreversible impacts 
to the traditional farming practices and 
foodways of indigenous peoples and their 
lands; 
Whereas, according to the Midwest Center 
for Investigative Reporting, the foreign ac-
quisition of and increasing investments in 
American farmlands and agribusiness pre-
sents a risk to food system security and con-
tributes to increasing prices of the country’s 
farmland beyond the financial ability of 
local residents to purchase domestic farm 
land; and 
Whereas monopolization and an increase of 
large corporations and foreign interests in 
America’s farming sector, combined with a 
changing climate, creates an unprecedented 
negative impact on the regional economic 
strength and security of rural and Tribal 
communities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), 
SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
That— 
(1) the Congress recognizes the many con-
tributions that family farmers and ranchers, 
including historically underserved farmers 
and ranchers, have made to America’s agri-
cultural industry, local food production, food 
sovereignty, rich variety of the country’s 
abundant food supply, and traditional and 
cultural agricultural practices; and 
(2) it is the sense of the Congress that the 
Federal Government should encourage sup-
port for family farmers and ranchers, in 
rural communities and on indigenous lands, 
and ensure access to open and fair agricul-
tural markets in the United States, by intro-
ducing the Farmers Bill of Rights. 
SEC. 2. FARMERS BILL OF RIGHTS. 
The Farmer’s Bill of Rights is as follows: 
(1) RIGHT TO FAIR, OPEN MARKETS.—There 
must be a competitive open marketplace to 
buy seeds, fertilizer, and other goods, and to 
sell produce, livestock, and meat for all peo-
ple. It has become nearly impossible for 
independent farmers, processors, seed sup-
pliers, mechanics, and other rural businesses 
to compete with multinational monopolies. 
Farmers need strong antitrust safeguards. 
(2) RIGHT TO FEED THEIR COMMUNITY.—Mul-
tinational corporations have taken control 
of the country’s food system by shutting out 
independent 
processing 
and 
distribution 
businesses, consequentially locking farmers 
out of their local markets and denying do-
mestic consumers local, regional, and cul-
turally traditional foods. In the United 
States, Native Americans suffer from the 
highest rates of food insecurity with African

Americans and Hispanic communities more 
food insecure than the national average, 
which could be remedied through investment 
in local food systems, greater regulatory 
flexibility, and Tribal self-governance pro-
grams. 
(3) RIGHT TO FAIR CAPITAL.—With the loss 
of community and regional banks, coupled 
with the extraction of wealth from rural 
communities by large corporations, farmers 
and local businesses cannot access the cap-
ital necessary to operate. Congress must en-
sure that all farmers, regardless of back-
ground, can access the credit and capital 
they need. This includes Native American 
producers and Tribal agricultural enterprises 
that often must contract with Federal agen-
cies for resources, and African-American 
farmers who have endured historical dis-
crimination accessing farm credit. 
(4) 
RIGHT
TO
PROTECT
NATURAL
RE-
SOURCES.—If large corporations want to pur-
chase land and operate megafarms, they 
have a duty to protect the Earth’s soil, 
water, and natural resources, as rural and in-
digenous farmers have for generations, in-
cluding the protection of acequias that sus-
tain accessibility to water, local agriculture, 
and traditional irrigation practices. Cor-
porate megafarms have a duty to support 
conservation by following reasonable stand-
ards for aquifer use, manure storage, and 
other land-use guidelines. Preserving land- 
based agricultural resources is vital to be-
ginning to mitigate the impacts of climate 
change and preserve natural resources for 
both the tradition of diversified rural family 
farming and the cultural sustainability of in-
digenous agricultural communities. 
(5) RIGHT TO LOCAL LAND CONTROL, PROP-
ERTY
RIGHTS, AND
PROTECTION
OF
TRIBAL 
LANDS AND SOVEREIGNTY.—Counties and other 
local governments should have the ability to 
pass and enforce ordinances regulating the 
size, placement, and scope of megafarms to 
protect the value of rural family farmers’ 
land and the surrounding environment. Afri-
can-American farmers and other historically 
underserved farmers and ranchers should re-
tain their land ownership and rights. Tribal 
Governments are sovereign nations with the 
inherent right to independently control their 
lands through self-governance programs to 
safeguard traditional foods and medicines for 
their citizens’ wellbeing and preservation of 
ceremonial practices of American Indian and 
Alaska Natives, including the expansion of 
historically diminished indigenous hunting, 
fishing, and gathering rights. 
(6) RIGHT TO FOOD SECURITY.—Foreign own-
ership hurts family farmers and ranchers and 
raises national security concerns. A strict 
cap on foreign ownership of farms, farmland, 
and agribusinesses should be set to ensure 
that all American farmers can access domes-
tic farm land. 
(7) RIGHT
TO
REPAIR.—Huge corporations 
and their Wall Street backers have gone so 
far as to prevent local businesses and farm-
ers from fixing their own tractors and equip-
ment, forcing them to pay corporate techni-
cians to make all repairs. A farmer should 
have the right to fix their own equipment as 
they see fit. 
(8) RIGHT
TO
TRANSPARENT
LABELING.—A 
farmer should be able to label their food ac-
curately 
and 
transparently—including 
strong country of origin labeling standards. 
(9) RIGHT TO RURAL OPPORTUNITY.—Monopo-
lies have hollowed out local economies and 
taken away the traditional pathways of op-
portunity for free enterprise that helped 
communities thrive. No farmer should have 
to choose between continuing to operate 
their farm and getting access to good schools 
and health care. No farmer should have to 
choose between farming and providing a fu-
ture for their children. Farmers need the 
right to basic services in rural communities. 
(10) RIGHT TO PRESERVE A DIVERSE COMMU-
NITY OF FARMERS AND FARMING PRACTICES.— 
For too long, historically underserved farm-
ers and ranchers have lacked a voice on local 
and national agricultural policies and devel-
opment. Congress must ensure that histori-
cally underserved farmers and ranchers have 
fair opportunities in the market, a seat at 
the table in policy development, access to 
culturally relevant training and technical 
assistance, and equal treatment by all Fed-
eral agencies.

CELEBRATING THE 10-YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE PAUL L. FOS-
TER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT 
THE TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY 
HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER EL 
PASO 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the ten-year anniver-
sary of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine 
at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences 
Center El Paso. For ten years, the Foster 
School of Medicine has provided quality med-
ical education to future physicians that will 
serve the health care needs of patients 
throughout the country. 
In 2008, prior to the opening of the Foster 
School of Medicine, El Paso County’s average 
number of direct care physicians per 100,000 
people was 75 percent less than the national 
average. In an effort to alleviate this severe 
shortage of physicians in the region, govern-
ment leaders, community physicians, and 
community supporters worked to establish a 
four-year medical school in El Paso. 
The Foster School of Medicine has the dis-
tinct honor of becoming the first four-year 
medical school on the United States-Mexico 
border. It was also one of the first medical 
schools in the U.S. to integrate medical Span-
ish into its curriculum, allowing our nation’s fu-
ture physicians to provide culturally competent 
care. 
The Foster School of Medicine focuses its 
curriculum on community service. In 2013, the 
Foster School of Medicine established the 
Medical Student Run Clinic by a group of stu-
dents from the inaugural class with the help of 
faculty and staff. Students serve the commu-
nity of Sparks in far East El Paso, where the 
majority of the population is uninsured. The 
Medical Student Run Clinic is often their only 
access to health care. 
Congratulations to the Foster School of 
Medicine for their achievements in this dec-
ade. And I thank the faculty, staff, and stu-
dents for being leaders in health care while 
giving back to the El Paso community.

HONORING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF MEGAN BELL 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Megan Bell, my 
Chief of Staff, as she moves on from my 
Washington office after nearly 13 years of 
service. During her time on Capitol Hill, she 
has been a trusted advisor, an appropriations 
watchdog for this great Nation, and most im-
portantly—a tireless advocate for the people of 
Southern and Eastern Kentucky. 
Megan grew up the only daughter of a mid-
dle-class, 
blue-collar 
Irish-Catholic 
family. 
Those ‘‘up-early’’ and ‘‘hard-at-it’’ values have 
shown up every day to the Rayburn Building. 
Knowing the issues that matter most in my 
home district, she has been a consummate 
advocate on everything from combatting pre-
scription drug abuse and preserving and pro-
tecting the Mill Springs Battlefield, to giving a 
voice to individuals at risk of losing vital bene-
fits and boosting opportunities in our coal-
fields. In fact, she helped create a pilot grant 
program to provide an influx of federal dollars 
directly to our coal communities for economic 
development as they continue to rebuild in the 
wake of the War on Coal, which she precisely 
described as ‘‘strangulation by regulation.’’ 
Likewise, her tough, dogged oversight of the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers helped protect 
the business and community interests of our 
rural region, and the entire Lake Cumberland 
area during the unprecedented repairs of Wolf 
Creek Dam. 
She contributed to the remarkable success 
of the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin 
Summit, working alongside my district director 
Karen Kelly, to rally the White House and 
leaders from every stake-holder agency to 
help lead a holistic movement that is now the 
largest gathering of federal, state and commu-
nity leaders focused on life-saving efforts to 
fight the national opioid crisis. The entire pre-
scription drug abuse and opioid fight wasn’t 
just another issue for Megan, but one she 
passionately invested countless hours to study 
and understand at every level. She knows the 
opioid fight, the convictions of my heart, and 
the challenges in our communities, backwards 
and forwards. As a result of her expertise and 
expansive network, we called on other federal 
leaders to stand up to ‘‘Big Pharma’’ corrup-
tion, and enacted effective policy and legisla-
tive changes, like Prescription Drug Monitoring 
Programs, starting the Congressional Caucus 
on Prescription Drug Abuse, and so many 
other efforts that will continue to impact the 
opioid epidemic for many years to come. 
Navigating legislative ropes, surviving long 
hours, and becoming a glorified policy wonk 
inside these historic hallways, requires much 
more than a juris doctorate, which she impres-
sively earned while working full-time in my of-
fice. In her time on my team, Megan has right-
fully earned recognition far beyond Wash-
ington for her astute knowledge of multiple 
issues and has truly risen amongst her peers 
as a result of her sheer moxie, her engaging 
personality, and always maintaining a refresh-
ing voice of reason. 
Our staff is much like family and every de-
parture is bittersweet. As we offer well-wishes 
and work to fill the void of such a talented 
leader, I wish Megan the very best in the next 
chapter of her successful life and look forward 
to witnessing the accomplishments that are 
sure to come in the future. 
IN RECOGNITION OF PASTOR 
ITASKER HOLLINS, SR. 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with 
profound sadness that I rise to honor the life 
of Pastor Itasker Hollins, Sr., who passed 
away on February 2, 2020 at the age of 82. 
His legacy will live on through the love of his 
family and friends. Pastor Hollins was blessed 
with the support of his family, his wife Julia, 
daughters Judith, Diane, Nancy, son Elder 
Itasker, Jr., their spouses, and grandchildren, 
as well as sisters and brothers, nieces and 
nephews, and church family. 
On April 20, 1937 in Dallas, Texas, Pastor 
Hollins was born the 13th of 15 children to 
Pastor Booker T. Hollins, Sr. and Missionary 
Viola Hollins. In 1952 his family relocated to 
California. Pastor Hollins met Julia in 1955 
and they married two years later. They cre-
ated a loving family of three daughters and 
one son. 
Many momentous achievements outline 
Pastor Hollins’ career. In 1975, he and Julia 
began services at the Oak Park Methodist 
Church in Sacramento, California. He and his 
wife later formed the All Nations Church on 
Broadway in the heart of the Oak Park com-
munity. There, the congregation benefited 
from programs including a weekly food bank, 
annual home buyers’ seminars, financial class-
es, jail and prison outreach programs, yearly 
prostate and breast cancer seminars, com-
puter training, tutoring programs, and summer 
youth programs. The project was named ‘‘The 
Miracle on Broadway’’. The work of Pastor 
Hollins and his wife only continued to grow. In 
2013, the Itasker Hollins Community Economic 
Development Corporation, in partnership with 
the Related California Corporation, built a sen-
ior complex in Oak Park. For over four dec-
ades, Pastor Hollins served the ministry, earn-
ing him recognition as a spiritual and commu-
nity leader. 
Madam Speaker, today we honor Pastor 
Itasker Hollins, Sr. and his contributions to our 
community. His legacy will live on forever.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF BILLIE SUE 
HOGGARD 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of my close 
friend Billie Sue Hoggard, who passed away 
on Sunday evening. Billie Sue was a lifelong 
public servant, a political pioneer, and a de-
vout follower of the Lord. She brightened 
every room she entered, had a wonderful 
sense of humor, and a truly unmistakable 
laugh. 
Billie Sue was a nationally board-certified 
teacher. 
Generations 
of 
students 
in 
Jonesboro, across five decades and four 
schools, were blessed to find themselves in 
her classroom. She was selected for three 
international teaching exchanges by the Uni-
versity of Arkansas at Little Rock, teaching in 
China, Japan, and Mexico. Her passion for 
teaching could not be extinguished—she came 
out of a well-deserved retirement just a few 
years ago to go back to the classroom. 
Billie Sue’s service to her community ex-
tended to public office. She was appointed by 
Governor Mike Huckabee as Justice of the 
Peace on the Craighead County Quorum 
Court and as the Commissioner for the Arkan-
sas Educational Television Network. She was 
later elected by the people of the county to 
continue her service on the Quorum Court. 
She was an active member of many civil serv-
ice organizations, including the American Le-
gion Auxiliary, Lion’s Club, and countless edu-
cation advocacy groups. 
Billie Sue was a groundbreaking pioneer of 
conservatism in Arkansas. In the era of the 
‘‘yellow dog democrat,’’ Billie Sue was un-
abashedly Republican. She ran for State Rep-
resentative in Northeast Arkansas as a Re-
publican at a time in which it was unheard of 
to do so. While she did not win her election to 
state office, I believe it is safe to say that with-
out her, Eastern Arkansas would not be the 
conservative bastion it is today. Under her 
leadership of the Craighead County Repub-
lican Party from 2010 to 2018, the county 
flipped all legislative seats and well over half 
of county wide offices. She was awarded the 
‘‘Hi, I’m Frank White’’ Award in 2017, the high-
est distinction given by the Arkansas GOP. 
Billie Sue was a living proof that with pas-
sion, tenacity, and a tireless work ethic, an in-
dividual can accomplish anything. She put it 
best when she said, ‘‘I am personally con-
vinced that one person can be a change cata-
lyst, a transformer in any situation, any organi-
zation. Such an individual is yeast that can 
leaven an entire loaf. It requires vision, initia-
tive, patience, respect, persistence, courage, 
and faith to be a transforming leader.’’ 
I know today that Billie Sue Hoggard left this 
Earth proud of her litany of accomplishments 
and the positive transformations she made in 
Arkansas. Billie Sue is survived by her chil-
dren, Tammy, Kayla, Jess, and Tim, and 
grandchildren Meagan, Dane, Maxwell, Emma, 
Bella, Kate, and Jesslyn. I ask Congress to 
join me in offering condolences to Billie Sue’s 
family, and commemorating the life and 
achievements of an incredible leader and 
servant.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. DAVID STERN 
HON. NITA M. LOWEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life, accomplishments, and legacy of 
Mr. David Stern of Scarsdale, New York. Mr. 
Stern passed away on January 1, 2020, at the 
age of 77. An attorney by training, Mr. Stern 
served as commissioner of the National Bas-
ketball Association (NBA) from 1984 through 
2014. Mr. Stern is survived by his adoring 
wife, Dianne, and his two sons, Andrew and 
Eric. 
As NBA Commissioner, Mr. Stern shep-
herded the NBA from a middling American 
sports product to a global entertainment giant. 
During his tenure as commissioner, the NBA 
gained 7 new franchises, opened offices in 15 
cities outside the United States, and televised 
games in more than 200 countries and in 50 
languages. 
Business accomplishments aside, David 
Stern’s socially responsible leadership of the 
league was truly groundbreaking. He was 
deeply committed to advancing opportunities 
for women in the game of basketball, over-
seeing the creation of the Women’s National 
Basketball Association (WNBA) in 1997. In 
speaking of his commitment to the WNBA, the 
league’s first president, Val Ackerman, said, 
‘‘Without his vision and engagement, the 
league wouldn’t have gotten off the ground. 
He was the mastermind, and the WNBA was 
really in line with his vision about how sports 
and society are intertwined.’’ 
We also recognize David Stern for his sup-
port of Los Angeles Lakers forward Earvin 
‘Magic’ Johnson in the wake of Johnson’s 
HIV+ diagnosis in 1991. In an era of great 
mythmaking and stigma regarding people liv-
ing with AIDS and HIV, Stein appeared pub-
licly with Johnson at a press conference in the 
announcement’s wake and invited Johnson to 
participate in that NBA season’s All-Star 
game. The next summer, he ensured John-
son’s inclusion on the 1992 Olympic ‘Dream 
Team’ that sent NBA players to compete in 
the Olympics for the first time in the league’s 
history, an achievement Stern also master-
minded. 
Stern’s public support for Magic Johnson, 
coupled with his efforts to educate both the 
league and the public about the reality of the 
disease, was more than just a nice gesture 
from employer to employee. It was a bold, 
public demonstration of compassion that 
changed minds and undoubtedly helped save 
lives. For this, we honor the character and 
strength of David Stern. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of 
Congress to join me in recognizing David 
Stern’s exceptional accomplishments and in 
sending our sincerest condolences to his fam-
ily, friends and colleagues.

PROTECTING 
CRITICAL 
INFRA-

AGAINST 
DRONES 
AND EMERGING THREATS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 4432, the ‘‘Protecting 
Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and 
Emerging Threats Act.’’ 
As Chairman of the Cybersecurity, Infra-
structure Protection, and Innovation Sub-
committee, I have made it a priority to under-
stand the security challenges facing our critical 
infrastructure and to figure out solutions. 
My district in Louisiana has one of the na-
tion’s highest concentrations of critical infra-
structure—including pipelines, refineries, ports, 
and stadiums. 
I have talked with owners and operators of 
critical infrastructure in my district and across 
the nation about the security issues they’re 
facing, and there is always one common 
theme: Drones. 
Drones are hardly a new technology, but 
they do present policymakers at every level of 
government with serious challenges. 
It’s a challenging issue because drone tech-
nology is an important tool in infrastructure se-
curity, providing situational awareness over 
critical infrastructure. 
At the same time, we know bad actors can 
use drones to move explosives, conduct sur-
veillance and mapping activities, and carry out 
cyber attacks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E169 
February 11, 2020 
The weaponization of drones is not just a 
potential concern—we have seen it happen. 
Late last summer, drones were used to 
strike oil installations in Saudi Arabia, halting 
half of the country’s oil production. And, in late 
2018, reports of drone activity near the runway 
at Gatwick Airport outside London grounded 
hundreds of flights. 
The Federal government is aware of the se-
curity threats posed by drones, but we don’t 
have a full picture of where and how often un-
authorized drone activity is happening near 
our critical infrastructure. 
Owners and operators of chemical facilities 
regulated 
under 
the 
Chemical 
Facilities 
Antiterrorism Standards program have com-
plained that no one in the Federal government 
collects information about unauthorized drone 
activity over their facilities. 
Our operators want to share important 
threat 
information 
that 
can 
inform 
our 
antiterrorism efforts but there’s no one to col-
lect it. 
We must do better. 
H.R. 4432 would require DHS to establish a 
way for owners and operators to voluntarily re-
port information about unauthorized drone ac-
tivity over their facilities. DHS would then use 
that information to develop a threat assess-
ment on unmanned aerial systems and other 
emerging threats. 
H.R. 4432 marks an important step forward 
for DHS in its partnership with the private sec-
tor and in gaining full situational awareness 
about the threats posed by drones in the U.S. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
I want to note my concerns with the Presi-
dent’s FY 2021 budget request for the Cyber-
security and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA). 
Despite bipartisan agreement that CISA 
needs more resources to deal with more fre-
quent and sophisticated cyber attacks, the 
budget slashes DHS’ cybersecurity arm by 
$250 million. Inexplicably, it calls for a $10 mil-
lion cut for cybersecurity support for State and 
local governments, at a time when they are in-
creasingly targeted by foreign adversaries and 
criminal hackers. 
Worse still, it would eliminate funding for 
DHS’ chemical antiterrorism security program 
that was established under the leadership of 
former Secretary Chertoff in response to intel-
ligence suggesting chemical facilities would be 
a ripe target for terrorists. 
Chemical facilities remain a target for terror-
ists, and I am disturbed by the Administra-
tion’s poor judgment related to this important 
antiterrorism program. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to support 
H.R. 4432.

is booming. Job growth surged by 225,000 po-
sitions in January, and the unemployment rate 
remains near the 50 year low. These are just 
the latest indicators of a resurgent American 
economy under President Trump. With Mr. 
Trump in office, the U.S. economy has added 
more than 100,000 new jobs for 34 of the 38 
months and the unemployment rate has been 
at or below 4 percent for 23 consecutive 
months—nearly two years. Americans of all 
backgrounds have benefited from this eco-
nomic boom with the unemployment rates for 
African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and 
Asian Americans all hitting record lows in 
2019. The labor force participation rate is at 
63.4 percent, the highest level since 2013 and 
nearly three quarters of new positions are 
being filled by individuals previously outside 
the labor force. Wage growth is holding at or 
above 3 percent for the 18th consecutive 
month and, under President Trump, workers’ 
wages are rising faster than managers’ wages. 
With all of this success, it is easy to forget 
that this booming economy has also brought 
labor shortages throughout the economy, par-
ticularly for seasonal businesses. Right now, 
there are simply more seasonal jobs open 
than there are Americans willing, able and 
qualified to fill them. On behalf of seasonal 
businesses from industries such as seafood 
processing, tourism and hospitality, land-
scaping, fairs and carnivals, golf courses, re-
forestation, contractors and horse racing, who 
continue to struggle with seasonal labor short-
ages, I rise to urge the administration to re-
lease adequate supplemental H–2B visas, as 
authorized by the Further Consolidated Appro-
priations Act 2020, to meet these seasonal 
businesses’ temporary seasonal labor needs. 
As a member of the Committee on Appro-
priations, I coauthored the amendment in the 
FY 2020 Department of Homeland Security 
Appropriations bill that authorizes the adminis-
tration to release additional H–2B visas. In 
January, I sent a letter with 188 of my col-
leagues, both Democrat and Republican, from 
both the House and Senate, urging the Admin-
istration to exercise that authority and release 
additional H–2B visas. The bipartisan support 
for this program demonstrates the significant 
economic impact these workers have across 
our country. 
The temporary guest workers provided by 
the H–2B program are vital to the American 
economy and the economy of Maryland’s First 
District, particularly on the Eastern Shore, and 
support tens of thousands of down-stream 
American jobs. While it is ultimately the re-
sponsibility of Congress to provide a long term 
solution to the chronic shortage of H–2B visas, 
I strongly urge the administration to use the 
authority granted to them to continue to sup-
port these seasonal businesses and release 
an adequate number of additional H–2B visas 
to meet the labor demands of seasonal em-
ployers nationwide.

IN MEMORY OF MIDSHIPMAN 
DUKE ANTHONY CARRILLO 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Midshipman Duke 
Anthony Carrillo of Flower Mound, Texas. On 
February 8, 2020, Duke passed away after 
collapsing during his semi-annual physical 
readiness test. He was a dynamic, patriotic 
young man intent on serving his country as a 
military officer. 
He was the son of Gerald and Jennifer 
Carrillo, and brother of fellow midshipman, his 
twin Dylan, and younger brother Jake. 
He was a 2016 graduate of Flower Mound 
High School. An all-star athlete, Duke was a 
three-year varsity letterman in football and 
wrestling. He was an Eagle Scout, member of 
the Flower Mound High School Student Coun-
cil, and an active church and community vol-
unteer. In everything that he did, Duke strived 
for greatness. 
Led by his strong desire to serve his coun-
try, Duke received nominations to attend the 
United States Naval Academy and United 
States Merchant Marine Academy. He also re-
ceived a letter of assurance from the United 
States Coast Guard Academy. On June 28, 
2018, Duke was inducted in the Naval Acad-
emy’s Class of 2022, with his twin brother 
Dylan. 
Duke believed that service to country is one 
of the greatest achievements a man can have, 
and that he was called to take a stand to 
serve and protect our nation. 
He aspired to be a naval aviator, was a 
member of the Naval Academy’s Flight Train-
ing Squadron and was selected to serve as a 
Naval Academy Summer Seminar squad lead-
er. Duke majored in quantitative economics, 
was an active member of the 24th Company 
and an intramural athlete.

IN HONOR OF COURTNEY KETCHIE 
SILVER FOR BEING NOMINATED 
AND NAMED AS HONOREE FOR 
THE STEP AHEAD AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Courtney Ketchie 
Silver for being nominated and named as 
Honoree for the Manufacturing Institute’s Step 
Ahead Award. 
Courtney is the CEO of Ketchie Incor-
porated, an ISO-certified, woman-owned cor-
poration operating machine shop. She joined 
the company in 2008 and became the CEO 
after her husband lost his battle with brain 
cancer in 2014. Despite the devastating loss 
she took her knowledge from supply chain 
management and continued to propel the 
company forward. 
I was pleased to have the opportunity to 
meet Courtney and take a tour of Ketchie in 
2017. I was blown away by her focus on 
craftsmanship as well as her emphasis on, 
and providing of, an ideal work environment 
for her employees. 
In addition to being CEO, Courtney remains 
active in the community. She is passionate 
about sharing her knowledge with others and 
encouraging woman to be leaders. In fact, she 
hosts community college students and partici-
pates in Manufacturing Day activities with local 
high school leaders. When she isn’t working or 
mentoring, she can be found volunteering. 
Whether it’s preparing meals for youth at local 
shelters or participating in church activities, 
there are no bounds to her generosity in our 
community. 
The Manufacturing Institute launched the 
STEP women’s initiative to support women in 
science, engineering, production, and tech-
nology careers and inspire others to join them. 
I cannot think of a more deserving person of 
this honor. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Courtney Ketchie Silver and her 
STEP AHEAD award nomination and as being 
named an Honoree.

IN HONOR OF MRS. CHARLOTTE P. 
TAYLOR 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
today in honor of Mrs. Charlotte Taylor. Mrs. 
Taylor unfortunately passed away in May 
2015. However, I am pleased to announce 
that Hamilton Homes Middle School (HHMS) 
has announced that its cafeteria will bear her 
namesake. A pleasant gesture commemo-
rating her wonderful life. 
Charlotte worked a rewarding 44 years as 
both a bus driver and instructional aid for King 
William County Public Schools (KWCPS). She 
not only ensured the safety of our students 
during transit, but also selflessly served stu-
dents with special needs by mentoring them 
and bestowing upon them the values of a prin-
cipled life that we all should abide by. 
Charlotte cherished family values and was a 
role model to her community. She was 
blessed with a loving family and was an in-
credible mother, grandmother, and wife. Her 
generosity and consideration towards any-
one—from the local hunters to a struggling 
family—has not been lost on those who have 
met her. Her faith in God and the ethics she 
lived by are a reminder that God’s grace lies 
within anyone willing and courageous enough 
to practice what they preach. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to 
join me in honoring the life of Charlotte Taylor 
and applauding KWCPS for approving Ham-
ilton Homes Middle School’s cafeteria to bear 
Charlotte’s name. Her sacrifices, hardships, 
and devotion to others are worthy of rev-
erence. On behalf of America’s First District, 
we say thank you.

RECOGNIZING COURT REPORTERS 
AND THE NCRA 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 11, 2020 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impor-
tant and irreplaceable work done by our court 
reporters and the National Court Reporters 
Association (NCRA) during national court re-
porting and captioning week from February 8– 
15. 
As guardians of the record, Court reporters 
have a large impact on capturing history for 
posterity. During our nearly 250 years of 
American history, court reporters have been 
the cornerstone of our American justice sys-
tem. From George Washington’s Farewell Ad-
dress to Lincoln’s divided house speech, these 
noble servants have transcribed some of the 
most important pieces of American history. 
Today, the NCRA provides a free course to 
introduce Realtime writing to all Americans. 
This course allows high schoolers, career 
changers, college redirects, and military vet-
erans to see if a profession in Realtime writing 
is a good fit for them. 
I’m proud to be the co-lead of H.R. 5285, 
the Training for Realtime Writers Act, which 
will help continue providing grants for training 
court reporters and closed captioners while 
also encouraging individuals with disabilities to 
pursue a career in Realtime writing. 
I want to thank Realtime writers everywhere 
and the NCRA for all the hard work they do.
